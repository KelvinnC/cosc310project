    "reviewTitle": "Joker isnt just an awesome comic book movie, its an awesome movie, period.",
    "reviewBody": "Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as\nan engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant\nBatman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready\nto debate the film for years to come.\nClearly drawing its spirit and style from classic 70s and 80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork\nOrange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for\nthe hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw\nit dubbed \"Fear City.\"This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness,\nteetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place thats typically fantastical seem\nfamiliar, its not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; its what its allegorically about\nthat makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece\nbut it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Jokers setting (roughly 1981) not only allows\nthe film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology\nthat nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere\n(including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors werent ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while\ndriving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting\ndynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp\ntrapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less\nsaid about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better -\nthis is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end\nresult of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we\ndeserve.Joker is an indictment of a societys collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than\nnecessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gothams\ndowntrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured\nemotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Drivers\nTravis Bickle called himself \"Gods lonely man\" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gothams lonely man. Arthur is ultimately\nseeking human connection, something he tragically wont find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the\ncitys own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it\ndoesnt ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be\nuncomfortably drawn from Arthurs descent into violent madness, the film still knows hes deranged and not to be\nromanticized - merely understood.\nThe Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips sharp direction and\nclear vision but also Joaquin Phoenixs indelible performance. Arthurs uncontrollable laughter looks as though it\nphysically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks\nhealthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix\ncaptures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed\nindividuals inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, whos in nearly every scene, all of\nwhich adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthurs tortured headspace. As solid as Robert\nDe Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenixs film and he delivers a tour de\nforce.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie\nwisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthurs\nincreasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay,\nnightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that\ndemands multiple viewings; one of Jokers strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real\nand what was imagined, and no one will be able to say anothers read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of\nfictions most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isnt just an awesome comic book movie,\nits an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in\ndecline. Joaquin Phoenixs fully committed performance and Todd Phillips masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC\nsource material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the\nright ways.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best in Venice. Best CBM of all time? Perhaps.",
    "reviewBody": "Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic\nstorytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film,\ndelivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it.\nPhillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie\nfilm rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a\nlove for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised.\nHe navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay\nhomage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves\nthrough each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits\neven roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we\nactively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and\nstrategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin\nPhoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and\nmost memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that\nyou can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at\ntimes he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur\nFleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers\nthat will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise,\nwhile the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC\ncharacters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So\nwhere does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark\nKnight.",

There\nare some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction\nare great, Todd has proven himself as a director.

Joker is a protagonist that youll never forget, Ill\ngarantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this\nmad world where theres no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, its a Pirandellian concept in a way but\nthats the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever\nview. An origin movie that youll never expect. I dont spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical\naspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas\nWayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\nI hope well talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.",

In this case Joker is absolutely false advertisement. Should have been\ncalled Arthur or Decent into Madness. I went in expecting a complex story and what o got was a mix of Taxi Driver, King\nof Comedy, some Joker Gotham tie ins and an,IMO weak script and plot. I will be in the minority in this age of hype but\nthis movie is not on the scale of true masterpieces like Se7en, Leon, The Usual Suspects. Joaquin may get nominated for\nawards but as film I would not nominate this film due to its weak script. The best in the film, the acting of Joaquin\nand the cinematography. Everything else is meh.",

    "reviewBody": "I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a\nnear-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that\nregards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films\nin the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society.\nAnd thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\nIts a take on the Joker that differs from Ledgers, but Id say that both are equally as good. The main difference\nmight be that Ledgers joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenixs is insane to the root.Despite being a movie\nabout a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (Id exclude the Dark Knight\nTrilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolans movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a\ndistinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however\ndo not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorseses Taxi Driver and his The\nKing of Comedy, but also Chaplins Modern Times is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by\nTodd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once\nUpon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",

    "reviewTitle": "Joker wants to be a movie about the emptiness of our culture. Instead, Its a prime example of It",
    "reviewBody": "Until now, the only review of this movie that I mostly agree with is the review from The Times. I stole the title of\nthis review because it just hits the nail on the head.In the first impulse, I didnt even want to watch this movie,\nbecause Im just fed up with the Joker. DC has many, much more interesting villains than Joker. Its time to tell\nstories about them and not constantly repeat the Jokers story, where there is no chance to say anything new, because in\nfact the Joker is not an interesting story at all, anymore. A rejected, angry man, who fails in life, a clown who\nbecomes a killer - story as old as the world.Everything that could be said about Joker, said Nolan in the Dark Knight\nTrilogy, plus various comics and yes - Batman and Joker cartoons too. Nolan also told the Joker story more subtly than\nthis movie, not only by the whole story structure, but also excellent dialogues. People who, I already see, claim in the\nreviews, that it is this film, that fully reflects the depth of the Joker character or that it is such a successful \nartistic  film - they simply try to cast a spell on reality, giving the film a meaning that doesnt exist .In Nolan\nTrilogy Joker is really The Joker - madman, but with hatred and goal to burn the world down. Joker kills Rachel which\nBruce never gets over. Alfred burns Rachels last words to save Bruce from more pain. In an attempt to save Bruce from\nconfronting Bane, Alfred disarms him with the truth even if it means saving his life. Even tho he isnt mentioned in the\n3 film, you see how Joker messed up the characters in this film . But he isnt the ONLY ONE who beat Batman in this\ntrilogy. All the villains beat Batman in one way or another. Ras broke Batmans will, Scarecrow broke his mind, Joker\nbroke his spirit, Two-Face broke his hope, Bane broke his body, Talia broke his heart, hell even Catwoman broke his\ntrust early on....Joker didnt know Batmans identity. He didnt even plan to torment Bruce for years.....But the\neffects of his actions in the previous film TDK are felt in the third one. By corrupting Dent, both Batman and Gordon\nhad to stage a cover up - we see Gordon struggling to deal with this lie, praising the man who almost killed his child.\nThe lie he told 8 years ago for the greater good is eating him up inside. Then there is Bruce - Joker may not have known\nhis identity but he certainly deduced that Rachel meant something to Batman. Joker kills too many people to force Batman\nto remove his mask and Dent boldly steps up to claim hes Batman. Rachel sees this on the news and is disappointed that\nBruce did nothing to intervene and its arguable this is what drives her to write the letter choosing Dent over Bruce.\nIt is this same letter Alfred burns to spare Bruce more pain, thus leading to the bitter break-up between Bruce and\nAlfred.This third movie is the aftermath of the Jokers actions and how the characters and city of Gotham are coping\nwith it after 8 years. TDKR feeds off the relevance of its predecessors like any good third installment. 8 years of\nfalse peace covering a giant lie and watching that lie eat at Bruce, Gordon and the city.The lie that enabled The Dent\nAct to be passed, removing organized crime and as a result removing the need for a Batman. The rich and elite\nbenefitting from the clean streets while the middle class and poor gap widens.The fact that Batman and Gordon had to lie\nproves to the League that Gotham is truly beyond hope and must be destroyed.And a lie that caused Bruce and Alfred to\nbreak up....Joe Chill broke his happiness when he pulled the trigger and fired the bullets that killed his parents and\nalso Falcone and Maroni were indirectly responsible for Batmans birth, and what makes Nolans trilogy a masterpiece is\nindeed how each of his enemies are responsible for major tragedies in his life or events that will scar him for life and\nas for the enemies he fought in the trilogy. I would say that The Joker (not only cause hes the archenemy) is the one\nwho got under his skin in the most personal way not only by killing Rachel but by corrupting the \"honest and perfect\"\nWhite Knight but because he forced Batman to take on a role that in Batmans eyes it would be best for him by sparing\nthe truth of who the real white knight was when he was pushed to his limits.Nolan put in each film the right villains\nneeded for all 3 stories. Not only are they responsible for tragedies in Bruces life, but they mirror Bruce like some\ntwisted perversion of what he could have been IF he crossed the line of an executioner. This is for me one of the most\ninteresting elements of Batman from the source material.Him never crossing the line his villains deliberately or\naccidentally cross is what he uses to check himself so he doesnt end up like them. In Rises there are many instances\nwhere I actually thought Bruce wouldnt make it! Seeing a hero humiliated and vanquished was so unexpected and effective\nit made me actually care for Bruce more than ever! There was a lot at stake this time around... More emotional layers\nare in the third film.The problem with THIS movie is that the creators here openly say, that Joker is mentally ill.\nWhat?! This is a parody of the whole idea of The Joker. Yes, he is a sadist and psycho, but not in the sense of  crazy\n. Besides, this movie is also full of cheap and failed imitations and quotes from movies like Taxi Driver or the Nolan\nTrilogy, Why do so few people notice it? This is not a breakthrough film, it is a mixture of everything that came\nbefore. Infantile psychology at the level of high school dramas for teens and the plagiarism of many other outstanding\nfilms. Making a  serious  movie about Joker is possible only thanks to Nolan, he, thanks to his Trilogy, has changed\nthe approach to the whole genre,  Batman Begins  was the start of the more serious approach to the superheroe movies\noverall in cinema (Begins was released before Marvel movies).But of course everything about the most popular villain of\nall time - Joker - is promoted on a gigantic scale and in this particular case,  The Joker, the rest of the sheep\nfollowed it. Phoenix is a great actor, no doubt, but in my opinion the whole movie - script and direction - is full of\nclichs hidden under the guise of the social commentary that is another primitive truism.I will quote the Times review\nagain, because it is excellent at exposing the shallowness and pseudo-artistic nature of this film : The movies\ncracks - and its practically all cracks - are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly\nadolescent way, but it wants us to think its imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more\nviolent tirades, Arthur muses, Everybody just screams at each other. Nobodys civil anymore. Who doesnt feel that way\nin our terrible modern times? But Arthurs observation is one of those truisms thats so true it just slides off the\nwall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.Another\nproblem of  The Joker  is a very chaotic structure, which means that there is not too much entertainment and pure\ncinema in this movie. After some time it just becomes boring mess.What was great about Nolan was that Nolan was able to\ncombine the features of commercial, mainstream and independent film in one and what he said was authentic. He knew that\nsuch a film must also be entertainment, but he didnt limit The Trilogy to it. This accusation, which Nolan haters often\nrepeat - that Nolan is pretentious is not true, especially in Dark Knight trilogy (because I can agree that Inception is\nterribly pretentious). In TDK Nolan doesnt arrogantly run away from mainstream, because he fully understood what it\ntakes to make epic, successful superhero movie, but at the same time, he added depth to this story, by exploring both\nthe dark and the altruistic side of Wayne / Batman and exploring, but not overdoing the Joker.Nolan Trilogy revived the\ngenre without a doubt. We talking about real change - originality in the approach, but still entertaining. Nolans\nversion was finally epic tale about moral choices, tragic fate, true heroism of a man but also our weaknesses and about\nevil personified in Joker- evil which very often is just trivial, but still destructive as great Michael Caine/Alfred\nsays : Some men just want to watch the world burn. So no matter how many great superhero movies will come and how\ncritics will judge them, Dark Knight Trilogy is in history books, because it changed the genre, just like Pulp Fiction\nchanged gangster films. Before DKT, superhero movies were very schematic and mostly drab. Now they are mostly\nsophisticated, every director wants to do something new and original or simply more within the genre and they are all\nfollowing Nolans footsteps.Whereas Joker by Todd Philiphs is the quintessence of pretentiousness and fakeness. There is\nnothing authentic in this movie. It is a collection of cheap fanfiction, quotes from movies like Taxi DriverNolan\nTrilogy (even if Todd said he did it to pay tribute to Scorsese and Nolan, it turned out clumsy), poured with sauce of\npop culture tricks. Phoenix battered body twists and turns on the screen, but there is no soul in this creation. Time to\nsay goodbye to Joker, DC. You have much better villains in your stable, whose story can be fascinating to tell. The\nJoker ceased to be interesting long time ago. Btw, Batman has always been a more interesting character to me, because\nalthough he is a superhero, he is also the only such a popular superhero, who has so much darkness, killer impulse, but\nalso humanity inside of him (and Bale showed all of this masterfully in Nolan trilogy). The ambivalence is fascinating\nhere. The Joker is a wounded clown, nihilist, murderer. This story is told in the cinema several times a year. There is\nnothing fresh about it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Probably one of the best comic book movies out there with a performance of Phoenix that will make you speechless at the end #Venice76",
    "reviewBody": "Still days after seeing it, Im still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August\n31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenixs\nperformance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch\nactors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow\ntransformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of\nbeauty to watch. Anybody whos watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you\ndont see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in\nmy opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this\nworld, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin\nScorseses best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political\ntensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King\nof Comedy\".\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring\nlaughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. childs hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his\nmental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesnt know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and\nall the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his\nworkplace, at his mothers house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day\nthat goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every\nmoment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout\nthe film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people\nat first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. Im not gonna go any further\ninto plot details since the films not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldnt have the name \"Joker\" in the title -\nthat everybody should go and watch this film because we dont get such deep sophisticated character study films like\nthis everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character\nslowly falling apart.\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily\ncut out. Thats probably my only negative with this film.\nBut still; its a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond\nbeing just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some\nsimilarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the\nBatman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of\nPhoenix!\nIm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which\nwas shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenixs greatness and even\nRobert De Niros acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but its amazing. I cant wait to rewatch it\nwhen it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76",

    "reviewTitle": "DCs masterpiece. Although a huge risk for the studio -- it paid of. A lot.",
    "reviewBody": "I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. Joker was easily one of the\nhighlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenixs breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips clever\ndirecting.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthurs\n(Jokers) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration\nfrom Scorseses 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. Theres a lot of nods and easter eggs for\nthe fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be\nexpected when our beloved caped crusader doesnt exist. Its a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime\nand chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the\nmost hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I dont want to go\ninto spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenixs performance as the clown prince of crime, theres really not much to say that\nyou havent read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a\nsuper realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best\npicture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. Its a deep character study of a mentally\nill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldnt be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I\ncant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!).",

This movie is a masterpiece and you can see that for yourself just by\nlooking at the rating. No movie in the history of IMDB has been at 9.6/10 for this long. No more words to say but i just\ncant explain the greatness of this movie. Just give it a shot and go to the theaters its definitely worth the money.\nHope you enjoy it like i did! (Sure you will)",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Joker of all will knock your sox off",
    "reviewBody": "The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has\nbeen mistakenly termed a \"comic book film\". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series,\nhowever, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic\nlaughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of\nthis peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the\nold kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.\nBasically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as \"The Joker\",\nstarted out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a \"condition\" (uncontrollable laughter)\nwhich made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense\nwhen brutally attacked by three \"respectable\" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder\nbecause only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him\nby a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which\nwill peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian \"Arthur Fleck \" (what a spotty\nname!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing.\nHis constant disclaimer is \"I have a condition\" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his\nlive on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to\nappear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenixs bravura performance and the end result of this\nmasterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is\nexhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense.",

If you dont know what Im talking about, watch the movie again and you will know ! But that doesnt\nnecessarily will prevent me from watching Joaquins version ! Or even liking it ! Joaquin without doubt is an excellent\nactor , hes already proven to be in many previous roles and Im sure he will add to the character some of his brilliant\nperformance but I believe the movie needs more than Joaquins Talent to beat Heaths version of the joker !

The 80s\nsettings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to\nsurvive.\nThe movie does not praise violence and its far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement,\nits all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a\nmisinterpretation of the picture.\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that\nsustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.",

This is less \"The\nDark Knight\" and more \"Taxi Driver\" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a\nwell-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that\nis failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If\nthere is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and\nrange is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps\nhimself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time\ncreates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece\nand it doesnt get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in\nourselves.",

    "reviewTitle": "Led by a stunning Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is an instant classic",
    "reviewBody": "Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillips gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics\nvillain, theres no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan\nchanged our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Jokers examination of the\nbirth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything weve ever seen before, stripping the well\nknown character back to the bare basics as were introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur\nFleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than its other comic book cousins,\nPhillips and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit\ninto a world that doesnt want to open its arms to him, in whats an engaging, cant look away character study that\nslowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It\nmay seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenixs full embodiment of Fleck goes down as\none of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as\nTravis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino\nachieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in\nwhat must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck\nappears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget\ncollection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and\nin doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved\ncreature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations\nof the character, its hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his\nown flavour and nuances to Fleck, theres no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledgers iconic take on the face\npainted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it wouldve only taken the film\nso far had Phillips and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Jokers astounding\noverall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.Its amazing to think that this is a film\nfrom the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillips grow into a whole new level with his\non point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Shers eye-capturing 70s like cinematography and Hildur\nGunadttirs memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings its A game too match\nits captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already\nteetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be\nno doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Flecks story to a much broader universe\nwithout ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as youd get\nregardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the\nages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement thats sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries\nout of 5",

There is pure acting and pure violence. Some people will like it, some\nnot.This is not Jared Leto surrounded by 1,000 knives without reason...this is the real world.The movie perfectly show\nour society nowadays and maybe this is one of the reason why is so good.De Niro performance its great as you can\nexpect, same goes to all other supporting actors.The music kills at some points, because its so intense with the\nparticular scenes.So ground based and so good. This is probably the best movie this year after \"Endgame\", honestly...you\ncant compare them, theyre both unique in their ways.I recommend this movie so much, but is not for everyone for sure.\nItll make you think about so much things in the end because as I said....We are all clowns...of our time!",

Never ever listen\nto the critics they are a bunch of sold ********.\nThere wasnt a single thing that could be controversial. Just pure Oscar winning performance by a great actor. And if\nsome incel gets triggered from this then its his evil brain that need to be shot.\nFor me, Heath ledger was an unpredictable clown with no emotions.\nJoaquin phoenix is a clown that blasted from pain into a monster.Some people will tell that (just to look cool) heath\nledger was the legend and Joaquin Phoenix was good but not heath ledger level even after watching this masterpiece, but\ndeep down they know that Joaquin phoenix surpassed Heath and achieved a god level(which is obviously many levels ahead\nof \"legend\").And that laugh, dear god that is just terrifying. you can tell by that laugh that the guy is in some\nserious emotional trauma.\ncritics was being like that this movie is so violent and disturbing and blah and blah blah. you can count homicides in\nthis movie on your fingers.\nJoker kills three sexual harassers, one backstabbing A-hole, one TV host(you should judge him after watching movie), his\nmother(which is not clear that either she is his biological mother or one who adopted him) and an Arkham asylum\ntherapist(which is not shown graphically).\nMovie is very brilliantly made. Everyone did a great job and hats off to Joaquin who took his performance to god level.\nsure in distant future someone can achieve god level performance but cannot surpass it.\nNever listen or read to any \"professional\" critic cause they are getting paid for it. So they cant be trusted. Go watch\nthe movie and make your own honest opinion because \"you are paying for it, not getting paid for it\".",

A society which will ridicule the isolated for being isolated and laugh and call him/her a clown\nfor not achieving anything. What follows when one man stands up against the hypocrisy and injustice is anarchy and as we\nall know joker is a symbol of chaos. The film definitely hits the right nerve in the audience who would notice the\nrelevance of the themes and concerns put forth to our current period and it may affect the wrong person..but the film\ndoesnt end with the creation of joker but the birth of Batman. Chaos is not left to be celebrated but to remind us why\nwe need order. The film is poetic in every sense though it falls slightly under to call itself a masterpiece.\nJoaquin Phoenix is a Master of his craft and a spectacular sight to see. On par with Ledger.",

All from the cinematography, thumping and\nsadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, its dark, its evolving, twisting and wow\njust you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh\nis so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice\njust on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is\ndone perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed\ninto the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When\nI was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost\nthe entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from\ntime to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely\nstunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so\nbad for the Joker, and its the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie,\nwho knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, its one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this\ndeserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear\nand anger, just satisfying!!",

    "reviewBody": "An anarchist, his falling apart life and a city on edge -- what else you need to make a gritty, dark and violent\nbiography of one of the greatest villain of cinematic history.Todd Phillips Joker ticks all the box when it comes to\nmaking an edgy and dark film like this. Splashing blood, outrageous deaths and a world which is crumbling apart. This\nfilm has everything. But the soul of this film is Joker himself. This rendition of Joker, very skillfully takes\ninspiration from all the past presentations and yet able to put a breath of fresh air on this legendary\ncharacter.Joaquin Phoenixs performance is not just breathtaking but strangely satisfying. Playing Joker on screen is\nperhaps one of the toughest jobs an actor can have. People have high hopes. And after Ledgers performance, Phoenix had\na big shoe to fill in. But he shines in this film. The ease with which Phoenix carries out the role, speaks volume about\nhis acting callibre.About the other aspects of the film, the cinematography is on point. It very craftily captures the\ncity from Jokers eyes. It shows his struggle and his making. The audience was very much used to watching Gotham from\nBatmans eyes, but perhaps for the first time, we as an audience has access to the other side of the narrative.Speaking\nof the other side, this film very successfully shows the class struggle we humans have to endure. Moreover it shows the\ncycle of hate and crime, which effects the Gotham City and also eventually the life of our own Bruce Wayne.This film is\na must watch. Although it might not be the best DC film ever to come, but it certainly is a living tribute to probably\nthe greatest and most nuanced character humans have ever created.",

    "reviewBody": "Joker is an original movie about the iconic Batman villain of the same name, exploring his origins. It tells the story\nof Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), a man who feels rejected by society.Joker is a mind-blowing film. Director Todd\nPhillips has given us a one of a kind comic book movie, that delves deep into the psyche of its titular character. What\nwe get is a riveting film with twists  turns, that will leave you guessing, right till the end. Joaquin Phoenix is the\nstar of the show, as Arthur Fleck. Phoenix completely immerses himself in the role  gives us another unforgettable\nperformance. He deserves all the praise, accolades  Oscar buzz coming his way. Joaquin Phoenixs performance as the\nJoker, matches up to Heath Ledgers legendary performance as the Joker, in The Dark Knight(2008). He also gives us a\nperfectly chilling Joker laugh. Robert De Niro is awesome as Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz is spectacular as Sophie\nDumond. Frances Conroy is outstanding as Penny Fleck. Brett Cullen is amazing as Thomas Wayne. Shea Whigham, Bill Camp,\nGlenn Fleshler  Leigh Gill are superb as Detective Burke, Detective Garrity, Randall  Gary, respectively. The\nsupporting cast is excellent. Joker is a must watch for all the fans of one of the best comic book villains of all time.\nGo for it, as soon as possible!",

    "reviewBody": "To be honest I was not a fan of this solo Joker movie because I knew that if it were to be a success then people will\nstart relating the Joker to Arthur Fleck.In my opinion the Clown Prince of Crime should not get a proper back story.\nThat uncertainty behind his past is one of the things that makes this character so interesting.But whatever they have\ndone here in this movie is amazing. The reason for Jokers grudge against the bat was something that we have all\nwondered about. They have explained the reasons here beautifully. The theater response was pretty positive during that\nreveal. So bat fans need not worry.Joaquin Phoenix begins as a semi lunatic and initially I did not very much like the\ncharacter. However by the end he becomes a full blown psycho and the acting goes up by some notches once he puts the\nJoker make up on. The final 30 minutes are a must watch.Orchestra deserves special mention. Spine chilling music at\ncrucial moments.Overall its a dark toned film where we see someone who despises the society (especially bcoz of what it\ndoes to him) and loses his life and mind in the process. Its also interesting that the film reminded me about Taxi\nDriver which is one of my favorite films. Robert De Niro who nailed that role plays a pretty decent part in this film\ntoo.Verdict: Slightly sadistic but beautifully crafted movie. Oscar contender for sure.",

    "reviewTitle": "Phoenix knocks it out of the park! [+78%]",
    "reviewBody": "What happens when the guy who made The Hangover series decides to cast an Oscar-nominated actor to play one of the most\niconic comic-book villains of all-time? You just might not have expected something as dark and zany as Joker to be the\noutcome. Heres an R-rated (supposedly) supervillain origin movie that screams DCEU but holds its own when it comes to\nstorytelling and character development.Joker is led by an explosive performance from its leading man Joaquin Phoenix.\nWhile no comparisons need be made to the versions of the character brought to life by Ledger or Nicholson, Phoenix,\nwithout a doubt, has clearly taken the character to even greater (and more notorious) heights. The first hour of Joker\nis an intense slow-burn. Arthur Fleck is a struggling clown-for-rent-turned-aspiring-standup-comedian who is often\nrag-dolled around by twerps (for being physically weak) and despised by (rich) commoners for his unusual demeanour\ncharacterized by unwarranted stretches of laughter.The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver takes its own sweet time\nto showcase Arthurs gradual breakdown and eventual embracement of anarchy. The only bits of comforting normalcy are\n(apparently) offered by his mother, his next-door neighbor, and a talk-show host on TV. However, theres more to each of\nthese characters than what meets the eye. The disturbing themes and elements in Joker indeed require a separate study of\ntheir own. That being said, the reasons attributed to Arthur crumbling under societal pressures are well-fleshed out and\ncoupled with a haunting score by Hildur Gunadttir, ravishing cinematography by Lawrence Sher, and the vintage\nScorcese-like sets, the psychotic transformation (into Joker) is cent per cent believable.Phoenix owns every scene that\nhes in, demanding your attention right from the opening scene where he pulls his mouth apart to form a fake smile. If\nthe sole purpose of this character study, as the actor remarked in one of his interviews, was to shed light on (in\naddition to lending some credibility to) the uneasy life of Joker before he turned into the vicious version that Nolan\ngifted us a decade and a half ago, the film is a pertinent win. It is Gotham city (before Batman) indeed, and whats\nGotham without the Wayne family? The Waynes presence in the film will also surprise you in more ways than one.What\nstood out to me were two (brilliantly written  directed) scenes: the first taking place in a moving subway where Arthur\nencounters three rich pricks that sets the ball rolling for his transformation and the second, during the climax\nstretch when all hell breaks loose in Gotham and a broken-down Arthur goes about his unruly antics amid a riotous mob. I\nfelt the film did not require the extended climax either, because the scene right before subtly told the viewer that\nthe transformation was complete.But when you look at the version of Gotham that Nolan built up versus the one Phillips\ndoes, one feels that the cynicism and hostility of its residents have been intentionally amped up for greater cinematic\neffect. Barely anyone in Phillips Gotham (except for a handful) seemed cheery or comforting. Probably, thats what the\nmakers were going for. Ignore the indistinct political commentary and you have a disturbingly dark piece of cinema in\nyour hands! No heroes-in-capes are coming to your rescue here!",

The story flows smoothly\nthrough Arthurs life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including\nRobert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure\nmasterclass of cinema.

    "reviewTitle": "Thought-Provoking Masterpiece!",
    "reviewBody": "Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any\njump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic\nvillain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult\nquestions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think\nfor hours after you have seen it.Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by \"Joaquin Phoneix\") who had\nsome psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the\nspan of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour\nruntime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well\nshowcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin\nPhoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may\nfeel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the\ndarkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as\nwell especially Robert De Niro.The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like\nHangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could\ntell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of\na slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially\nsince this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.The\ncinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and\ncharacters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasnt\nomnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.I am really glad that a movie like this exists.\nWhen comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these.\nProjects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up\nliking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that\nI really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful\ncinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take.",

    "reviewBody": "Smile and put on a happy face! This is what we are told when something bad happens or when we are having negative\nthoughts. But what if everything that happens is bad and all the thoughts are negative? In a city where every layer of\nsociety is bad in one way or another whether it is the poor, the rich or even the children, Arthurs sole dream was to\nmake people laugh. Unfortunately, no one was laughing except him and his laughter was filled with pain...Pain that has\nbeen building up over the years and now Gotham is about to feel it.While Heath Ledger was a sane man acting crazy,\nJoaquin Phoenix is properly insane in his behavior and actions with The Joker simply being a tool that he used to\njustify his madness and make people notice him. He is not a comic book villain who wants to a be menace for a hero or\nachieve some aspiring goal of wickedness. In this movie, there are no heroes, there is no good...only the bad and the\nugly. Arthur has no ambitions or reason and this is what makes him different and turns him into a movement that will\nerupt in an inferno changing Gotham forever.Joker is not a blockbuster movie. It is a hyperbolized portrayal of our\nsociety in which fear acts as fuel for hypocrisy, bigotry and jealousy that occupy peoples minds. Fear of being\noppressed by the rich. Fear of the poor taking over. Fear of one madman becoming a symbol of a rebellion that might have\na catastrophic aftermath making things worse than they are. Joker will create plenty of noise and discussion with people\narguing whether it is a masterful depiction of societal issues, a meaningless joke or maybe something in between. One\nthing is certain, comic book villains will not be the same.From the opening scene until the chillingly memorable ending,\nthe film is a work of art in every aspect whether it is cinematography, music or acting. Joaquin squeezed everything out\nof himself to bring the madness on screen that made us feel sympathy towards Arthur and his struggle; in reality though,\nhe didnt really care for it.P.S. I would recommend not to look at any ratings and not to view it as \"movie of the\nyear\". Experience it in your own way and draw your personal conclusions.#moviesshmovie on instagram",

    "reviewTitle": "MASTERPIECE",
    "reviewBody": "#FinalVerdictJoker movie is a thunderous masterpiece! Can easily compete with the best comic book films of all time. The\nbest movie of 2019 which belongs more in the Joaquin Phoenix Universe than the DC Universe.In the media, director Todd\nPhillipss Joker movie has been frenetically celebrated and a possible Oscars 2020 blessing (otherwise unthinkable for a\ncomic-based film) is speculated violently. Let me say it loud and clear: there is not a word of it exaggerated.Joker\nmovie is an \"origin story\", which tells how poor Arthur, nicknamed Happy by his mother, will become one of the most\nfamous enemies of Batman. However, here there is no question of the Dark Knight, the story unfolds when Bruce Wayne is\nstill a child.Surprisingly, Joker movie is totally a drama. A hard drama, rough, bitter, in a sticky environment. An\nenvironment that does not help Arthur to adapt. Director/writer Todd Phillips  cowriter Scott Silver take time to\npresent the characters, places and situations.Joker movie is a work closer to auteur cinema. Its important to note that\ntheres nothing wrong with this movie. Director Todd Phillips manages to infuse a very stylized colorful theme with the\ndark at the same time. Its bold, devastating  utterly beautiful.The sombre staging tackles you from the first second,\nshaking you through for two hours and never letting go until the last second. Joker movie is a horror story, not the\ncelebratory tale of an antihero. Joker is a game changer and plays in a league of his own.The great soundtrack consists\nmainly of classics of the swing era (Frank Sinatra et al) and is an integral part of the plot. The congenial score of\nHildur Gudnadottir amplifies the power of the images many times, so that every scene penetrates deep into the bone\nmarrow.Director Todd Phillips is a revelation at the helm and does the best directing job of his career with the twisted\nmaterial, able to strike a tone that straddles stabs of bleak darkness, gasps of hope and pangs of inevitability. I doff\nmy hat to you sir!DOP Lawrence Shers no-frills work to emphasize twisted, dark cityscapes, streets  nightmarish forms\ndeserves a huge shout-out. With picture-perfect contrasts  color, sublime compositions, the rich and complex\nmise-en-scne succeeds in elevating the movie.But all of this impressive, stylish construction wouldnt have worked\nwithout Joaquin Phoenix. He inhabits his role with a commitment thats magnetic in its unpredictability. His\nunbelievable performance will leave the most lasting impression on the audience. Robert De Niro - one of his best roles\nfor a long time! Zazie Beetz is remarkable.I left the cinema with lasting impressions  my mouth open. Beneath this\ngripping, bold, revisionist psychological thriller, Joker is the comic book villain we deserve right now.Joker movie is\na masterpiece! Its understanding doesnt cross the line into sympathy, as were left watching a man who becomes less \nless human as his tragedy unfolds. We repeatedly see him burst into laughter, but can never rule out whether hes\nactually crying.",

This movie is the\nperfect answer to the question why joker was the joker you saw on the dark Knight saga. I never another director could\npull it off but they did.\nIn the beginning you get a feeling that the directors relies heavily on the actors ability to act, but as the movie\nprogresses you find that the direction actually complements the acting skills. The subtle detailing in almost all the\nscenes is yet another positive of the movie. The first few minutes of the movie tries hard to get your attention, but\nwhen it succeeds to grab your attention you will be on the edge of your seat. Its definitely a masterpiece.\nThe direction and screenplay competes with one another. Both exceeds your expectations.\nThe cast is another plus. Actor has done wonders.\nThe story perfectly connects the dark Knight saga. It even makes you want to see the dark Knight again. A special\npsychological drama that gives you almost everything that you expect from it.\nOverall its a masterpiece",

    "reviewBody": "Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from\neveryone. This movie basically shows the 1980s America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous\nact took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on\nthe brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of todays world, where\neveryone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others condition or show empathy. The plot of the\nmovie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs\nmovements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the\nending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is\ntotally worth watching. Dont want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content.",

He isnt the villian but not the hero as well.\nJoaquin Phoenix never disappointed me with his performances though he cannot compete with Ledger. Shots were superb, but\nthe movie lacked the conversations. Joker in this movie, doesnt talk as much as he talked in Dark Knight.\nBut all in all, movie underlies the important issues of the society and gives us a clear look on what were missing.\nIts filled with smart details and deep meanings.

This was an emotional ride. You can understand why joker is, what he\nis. And where Ledgers Joker was a trickster cum terrorist type, this one is pure evil, dark and heavily mentally\ndisturbed. I wont say he surpasses Ledger, but I also wont say that Ledger dominates, best is to say that both are\nequally fantastic. This has a very different tone. It solely relies on Phoenixs performance, without phoenix there\nwont be the magic in the movie. Also another thing was the story is fully focused on Joker, nothing else. This is more\nof a character study movie. Also the story and the way its shot looks very much like a comic book. Overall, god bless\nTodd Philips and DC and Warner Bros and of course Phoenix for this",

    "reviewTitle": "Taxidriver 2",
    "reviewBody": "Heres my review of Joker , or Taxidriver 2 if Im being honest . So \" Joker \" is directed by Todd Philips , whos best\nknown for directing the hangover trilogy , due date and war dogs. I thought he was an oddball choice when it was first\nannounced but I get why . The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck , a guy who is constantly tormented by society\n, and he was great ! .... As Arthur Fleck , but as the joker ? Well thats for you to decide . For me personally I\nthought he was good , definitely better than Letos , but in b/w Ledger and Nicholson. The character of joker has has\nhad many origins over his comic book and media appearances . From  Gothams  Jerome valeska  to Jack Napier , to the\nmobster from mask of the Phantasm. But the most popular ones are him falling into a pit of acid and the other one about\nhim being a failed stand up comedian which then leads to the acid fall according to  The killing Joke by Alan Moore.\nThis movie takes the failed stand up comedian thing from that , drops the acid thing and then sets up its story , Which\nI thought was a really nod cause Jokers mainstream origin is now as familiar as Batmans origin. They also set up\nBatmans origin indirectly to the Jokers which I thought was personally brilliant . This movie justifies Jokers\nmaniacal forced laugh as a medical condition and at one point brings in the question of whether its legit or if hes\nfaking it . Unlike other iterations the joker is more sane than other people , like from this scene at a comedy club\nwhere hes the only guy laughing at the good jokes and everyone else is laughing at the inappropriate ones , so he\nwrites that fact down. This movie borrows a lot of themes from fight club such as the whole \" only when you lose\neverything are you free to do anything \" and many more. Its also very similar to Nightcrawler in terms of being an\nunderdog story and in making us root for the underdog even though hes a cold blooded merciless. Which is funny because\nNightcrawler was a modern take on Taxidriver and this movie is like 80% Taxidriver with the whole experimenting with\nyour gun without a shirt on , the one liners , the philosophical talks , the gun on your temple gesture and lots more .\nThe movie even has frickin Robert De Niro as a late night show host if you want more proof , which is ironic since De\nNiro plays a failed comedian who gets insulted by a show host in  the king of comedy  directed by scorcesse who also\ndirected Taxidriver . God ! My head hurts. Yeah , so I did some googling and it turns out scorcesse helped out with the\nscript . So it all makes sense now . I also liked how Joaquin Phoenix was able to go back and forth between his actual\nlaugh and his medical condition laugh which is similar yet you can spot the difference from how the latter is soulless.\nThats some brilliant stuff there. I also liked how Phoenix was able make us hope he doesnt get beat up by people in a\npublic train to hoping he doesnt kill that guy. The only gripes I had with this movie was that the soundtrack wasnt\npowerful enough when it needed to be and that in the third act in a TV studio set , Phoenix was overdoing it. In the end\n Joker  isnt the best origin for the character , its a movie which uses the characters label to gain hype for a\nTaxidriver spinoff which is amazing ! All that stuff I said about the movie being close to Taxidriver is not a critique.\nBecause this movie is brilliant . So its a great attempt to dive into the psyche of an anarchist and make you wonder\n.... Chaos is just order yet undeciphered.",

    "reviewBody": "Not sure if its a good idea to write a review here, as it seems, that Fanboys are rating down carefully considered\nreviews, just because they are not praising endgame, but so be it.I was not really disappointed, but I was also not\nstunned by this movie. It had a lot of shortcomings, logic-flaws and humor that simply wasnt funny or jokes that were\nsomehow not fitting into the storyline. Some characters developed in a direction, I personally did not like and the\noverall ending to the movie seemed rushed and somehow chaotic.Overall it was a decent ending to this MCU phase, but as\nalways, its down to personal preference if you like a movie or not or if you wished for a different storyline.There are\ntoo many things, that were illogical:\nNebula not telling the guys what it takes to get the soul stoneTony Stark not even questioning why Pepper is in the\nend-fight and not taking care of their childrenDepressed, fat ThorCaptain America being able to use Thors hammerCaptain\nAmerica living a life with his girlfriend without someone remembering it in their timelineAll of a sudden, all dead\nheros appear out of nowhere - all coming from Wakanda - how the heck did they know and gather in the first place?If you\nhavent seen Captain Marvels end credit-scene, Captain Marvel would appear right out of nowhere in this movie and\neveryone would wonder why.Thor being depressed and fat and this Softie-Version of Hulk were the main character\ndevelopments I also did not like.Personally didnt like Tony Stark being killed, but one saw that coming. After all, his\nstory was told. Captain America living another live at least got him a happy end, although and illogical one. The\nhairstyle of captain Marvel ... ok, lets not talk about this one.There are certain scenes that are indeed epic,\noverall, the movie was entertaining, but I honestly liked Infinity War more.Cannot tie this to specfic reasons, its a\ncombination of all the aforementioned elements, that simply didnt do the trick for me to make it an epic\nmovie.Considering myself being a big fan of the MCU franchise, I think all fans should see it, but if you are at least\nsomehow interested in a decent and logic storyline, be warned you might not be too overwhelmed by this movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Trying to wrap too many stories and not doing it well",
    "reviewBody": "Its way too long. Theres way too little fun or humor. Since its yet-another-time-travel movie, its not very\ninteresting. Though they try to take a new spin on it (explicitly stating that \"it doesnt work like in Back to the\nFuture\"), they end up with the same usual time-travel-silliness. The whole \"multiverse and multi-timelines\" is thus\npretty inconsistent and weird. Sure, this is a comic-book movie, things dont make sense, but, still, they should at\nleast be somewhat consistent.We never quite get why this chain of events is the only one out of 5 million that works and\nwhy had Dr Strange chosen it.And the whole \"cant undo real deaths, only the Thanos-induced kind-of-deaths\" is not\nexplained (sure, it probably would not make sense anyway, but, still, its kind of important and they dont even\ntry).Thanos goes full-blown villain, which is not in line with his character.It also doesnt wrap up the story for all\nof the original Avengers. You kind of get why are the ones that are still here the \"chosen ones\" (clue: this is a\nbusiness), but, still, its a \"conclusion of a story that is actually _not_ a conclusion of the whole story\".Even for\nthe ones that are done, their conclusions are not well done, are somewhat cliched, predictable and un-interesting.\nIron-Man fairs best here, but, still underwhelming.On the plus side, from a general movie quality, this is better than\nInfinity War, its better connected and the pace is better. Taking time-travel-silly aside, the story is OK. Although\nthere a few \"feminism in your face\" moments, it doesnt go overboard.Acting is good enough, but, it could have been\nbetter. Some things didnt work, like Hemsworths take on fat Thor, others were just not very good (ScarJo as the\n\"no-nonsense leader of the free-decimated-universe\" and Chris Evans take on Charlie Sheen - like Anger Manager) while\nthe rest were just OK - foremost RDJ. But, the thing is, weve seen these actors do better, its bad they couldnt do it\nagain.Bottom line, as a kind-of wrap-up for some characters, its OK, worth a watch. But, on its own or if youre not\ninto the characters that were \"wrapped up\", its not.",

    "reviewBody": "First, I am a HUGE Infinity Wars fan.. I even collected expansive statues re-enacting the epic battle in my shelves\n(after winning infinity style war with my wife of course).As predicted, the Director made the end sappy enough for some\nto shed tears. I was shedding tears myself on the account I would never make the insane amount of money the actors (main\ncasts) did. The first two hour was a total drag, it was as if the Director owes 3 hours to the audience or maybe in a\nmore sinister manner they believe epic movie should run at least 3 hours (Hence... 3 hours 1 minute including\ncredits).My major concern was the TIME TRAVELING plot which disregarded paradoxical continuity. Again, I am not a hater.\nI just found it highly inefficient if not plain stupid to have the remaining Avengers to go back in different TIMEs and\nPLACEs to collect each individual stone (the SOUL stone requires SACRIFICE!... duh). Would it be easier if they just\nwent BACK in TIME (along with Captain Marvel this time) to the planet where Iron Man  friends battled Thanos and\nstripped him off the gauntlet which was already full of stones? If they did this, there wouldnt be any needs of\ncasualty. Vision would be spared. Scarlet witch wouldnt need to be as traumatic then.Well, TIME HEIST damage has been\ndone, but AGAIN:\n1. Why didnt the future Nebula died instantly when she killed her PAST self? Violation for the Grandpa Paradox. Or, as\nit turned out, JC wasnt the only one to get resurrected afterall.2. Why on earth did Iron Man have to conjure the\ngauntlet onto himself while risking DEATH? Why cant he instead put the gauntlet on Captain Marvel or HULK (who did it\nonce and survived) or Thor and let them SNAP the hell of it? They were sorta IMMORTALS member of the Avengers with\nstrength that most likely will withstand the impact anyway. But no, Stark had to get the end credit.3. What made the\nsnapping of the Gauntlet by the Hero result in different way from Tanos? What if when Iron Man flicked it, the result\nwas also the annihilation of half the population? Too risky a think. I liked War Machines idea of going back in time\nand strangled baby Thanos instead.4. Finally, LOKI shouldve been brought to LIFE as the TIME TRAVELling thing would\ncancel out the event in which LOKI was killed by Thanos. I felt like this was an anticlimax to the flawless Infinity\nWars... sorry Stan. If you want a better time traveling movie, go see \"Back to the future\" or even \"Hot-tub time\nmachine\".. and \"Bill and Teds excellent Adventure\"",

    "reviewTitle": "A breathtaking Homeric battle",
    "reviewBody": "This is probably one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the moment, with Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of\nSkywalker (2019). The previous opus of the Avengers series, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), had left us high and dry,\nin the depths of the abyss, while the latest episode of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel (2019), gave us\nback a glimmer of hope.In short, I saw it in Paris this morning and I enjoyed it. Its an efficient blockbuster. The\nscript and the manifold plot twists permanently keep the audience spellbound and breathless. This movie is one of the\nfunniest and one of the most spectacular of the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe saga, not to mention an astonishing\nComputer-Generated Imagery, despite manifold script weaknesses that I will partially reveal below, within a dedicated\npost-script.Otherwise, a very unusual observation, at least within Paris: the audience has repeatedly applauded, at\nleast 7/8 times, including the very beginning and the end of the movie, conveying an uncontrollable impatience, like a\ncollective catharsis boosted to the extreme. And a female teen, about 17/18 years old, not far from me, cried.\nLiterally! The audience was obviously made up of fans conquered beforehand... and that was part of the show!So Marvel,\nwhats next? I am probably addicted and certainly impatient!As a post-script, a few remarks, annoyances or even\nirritations:1) First, a tiny spoiler as a favor. You will get absolutely nothing at the very end. Contrary to the Marvel\nhabits and customs, there is no post-credit scene.2) The first half-hour is an immeasurable disappointment. While Thanos\nhad, in the first opus, undertaken a Herculean task, a titanic challenge, a Homeric Odyssey in order to gather the 6\ninfinity stones and \"bring balance to the universe\" as a demiurge, in the second opus, he contents himself with a\nmiserable and lonely life such as a peasant from the Middle Ages, because \"the stones served no purpose beyond\ntemptation\". Wooooow! Literally incredible.3) Who understood this quote from Tony Stark to Steve Rogers? \"Its the EPR\nparadox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might have wound up pushing time through Lang\". Honestly, I do not\nknow if we need an IQ above 250 or below 60 to understand this quote...4) During the manifold fights versus the\nAvengers, we do not really see the difference between Thanos with the 6 infinity stones and Thanos without: his power\nseems unchanged!5) Time travel exists fundamentally in two versions: a change in the past will or will not have an\nimpact in the future. Even if the first category is the most representative with classics such as The Terminator (1984)\nor Back to the Future (1985), Avengers: Endgame (2019) clearly belongs to the second category.6) For their time heist,\nthe Avengers break down into 3 separate teams to join 3 distinct time-spaces in which there are 3 Thanos. One Thanos in\neach space-time: New-York in 2012, Asgard in 2013, Morag+Vormir in 2014. During 60 minutes, we follow these 3\nconcomitant stories. The Thanos from 2014 discovers and understands the whole intrigue thanks to his daughter Nebula.\nNevertheless, the Avengers are able to switch from one space-time to another one, thanks to a protective suit, a GPS\nbracelet and a capsule containing Pym particles. Thus, these three elements are specially designed by Tony Stark, with\nthe posthumous help of Hank Pym, for such an expedition and are a priori mandatory for the way in and the way back. But\nwe do not really know how, the Thanos from 2014 will go back in time with his faithful right-hand man Ebony Maw, the\nwhole armada and a huge spaceship. Wooooow! Even alone, this time-travel should be impossible.7) For the time heist in\nVormir, why Natacha Romanoff and Clint Barton have to go first through Morag, with James Rhodes and Nebula? The Avengers\ncould have splitted the whole team in 4 instead of 3 from the start, right? So, why 3 teams instead of 4? Knowing that I\nsee no reason for this detour via Morag, I think that the scriptwriters were desperately stuck and were looking for a\nway for the Thanos of 2014 to recover a free fast-pass, i.e. a protective suit + a GPS bracelet + a Pym capsule. Those\nof the mortal remains of Natacha Romanoff. Except that the Thanos of 2014 was absolutely not aware of the presence of\nthis corpse on Vormir. In any way!8) The scriptwriters have combined two ultra-complex concepts, i.e. time travel and\nquantum realm, in order to optimally cheat the audience. Indeed, when Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are back in New-York,\nthey are magically able to time-travel from New-York in 2012 to Camp Lehigh in 1970 without the help of any quantum\ntunnel device...9) .... and so on ... and so on ... The screenwriters had obviously bigger eyes than belly! In short,\nthis is a typical pop corn movie: turn your brain off, and then, and then only, enjoy the show!10) At last, a two-penny\nquestion: where did they find inspiration for the hairstyles? A moronic soccer player for Clint Barton, undoubtedly.\nWithout forgetting Carol Danvers, or how to disfigure a sex bomb with a pair of scissors?Thats all, folks!",

    "reviewTitle": "Its still Iron Mans world and the rest of the Avengers are still just living in it...",
    "reviewBody": "Well...most of them.The film opens on Jeremy Renners Hawkeye with his happy family...until he no longer has one on\naccount of them being dusted, which causes him to become vengeful Mohawkeye. Next up its my least favourite Avenger,\nTony Snark, teaching games to Nebula (my favourite Guardian of the Galaxy and the only one of those a-holes I actually\nLIKE. Mantis, who I also like and who *isnt* an a-hole, sadly only gets one line in the movie, but at least its a\nfunny one). The term drawn-out could be used to describe this whole opening with Tony. Self-indulgent would be\nanother. Just because you have a 3-hour+ runtime, Russos, doesnt mean you should waste it lingering on Tony sleeping,\netc. I did appreciate, though, that Nebula shows shes grown (as evidenced by the fact shes refrained from beating the\nsnot out of Tony the entire time theyve been stuck in space together). I was happy to see her featured so\nmuch.Thankfully things finally get moving once Captain Marvel saves their butts and interacts with the team in a scene\nmost have probably watched already. As she points out to Rhodey Rude (whose main role seems to be Joke/Movie Reference\nMan), shes been on other planets after The Snap that *didnt* have The Avengers to help them out. The fact that THOR\nsays he likes her should be enough (though obviously wont be for certain people). He also learns from the mistake he\nmade at the end of Infinity War regarding what bodypart to aim for on Thanos (who apparently wiped out half the\nuniverses populace so he could become a farmer and unfortunately destroyed the Infinity Stones). Too bad Nebulas\nrobbed of the chance to end Thanos in this movie (twice!), as she probably deserved to the most. Tony the Drama Queen\nproves he hasnt grown at all, laying the blame for everything at Caps feet.A skip to five years later reveals time\nhasnt been kind to Thor. Im saddened to see him reduced to this joke, when the first Thor movie is one of my\nfavourites. Theyve veered too far into comedy for my taste, as here hes played mostly for laughs on account of\nletting himself go (for those wanting shirtless Thor, youll get him...though youll wish you *hadnt*). Bless Paul\nRudds Scott Lang, as he brings a breath of fresh air to proceedings. His reunion with his (now grown) daughter is one\nof the few genuinely effective emotional moments in the film. Unfortunately, hes not given the respect he deserves,\nconsidering hes the one to come up with the idea of time travel (the subject of which is given the ultimate nerd\ndiscussion in this film). They go to Tony, who selfishly refuses to help the others get back everyone they lost since he\nalready HAS everyone HE wants (well...except for Spider-Kid, who is the reason he eventually changes his mind).Cut to\nafter a comedic sequence involving working out the kinks of time-travelling, the gang splits up to retrieve all the\nstones from the past. This is where the film kicks into gear, as we revisit past MCU films and encounter previous\nversions of characters. Highlights include: Cap seeing Peggy Carter again, Cap vs Past Cap, Thor spending some precious\ntime with his soon-to-be-deceased mother (plus, a Jane cameo! Theres actually lots of cameos in the film, but only a\nfew I cared about) and twice the amount of Nebula. Theres one rage-inducing consequence of visiting the past involving\nMohawkeye, Natasha and the Soul Stone. If you remember what happened with Gamora, youll know what that means. Although\nthe character who ends up being the sacrifice gets some good character/emotional beats in this film, it still doesnt\nmake up for the fact theyre unceremoniously given the permadeath treatment, thus robbing us of one of the MCUs best\ncharacters and the awesome dynamics between them and other characters. Given all the others that couldve been offed,\nWHYd it have to be...well...youll see.Ill give the film credit for seamlessly blending the present characters with\nthe past, and once things reach the climax, they definitely ensure this is the most epic battle weve seen yet which\ninvolves pretty much every character (except those whore unfortunate enough to *stay* dead, of course), some of which\nwill be getting future films or TV shows to appear in. I guess thats meant to make up for them not getting much\nscreentime here (like my fave, Wanda. At least she gets some revenge on Thanos and shares an emotional moment with\nMohawkeye near the end. Im looking forward to her show and hopefully future movie appearances too). Captain America\ngets at least two cheer-worthy moments, while Captain Marvel and her new haircut get to kick some major arse (dont\nfret, haters...she isnt given the final victory over Thanos. No, we all know who gets THAT privilege).I guess I was\nsupposed to feel sad near the end, but honestly I just felt relief, as its about time a certain someone faced some\nactual real consequences. Hopefully other characters will get to thrive/have substantial screentime now that somebody\nisnt hogging it all. Another good thing about the end is the camera shot which slowly moves through/covers everyone\n(all these characters weve come to know, plus a few we havent yet) at the funeral. The BEST part, however, is the\nfinal scene. Ive waited ever since the first Cap movie (my other fave MCU film) to get to the scene that ends this\nmovie, and I think its worth it. Im so very happy with it and who it involves.While therere no\nmid-credits/post-credits scenes, its worth sticking around to see the original six Avengers actors literally signing\noff. Itll probably take a couple of viewings to fully digest this film, as it throws in everything AND the kitchen\nsink. Its a fitting conclusion to Phase 3 (ignoring Spider-Kid 2). Now, bring on Phase 4!",

Cut some unnecessary scene in the infinity\nwar to get that 3 hour screen time and then end the film with Thanos head. We will face the shock of reality that even\nwhen they defeat the villain, its not enough. The world already changed. And then start the sequel, 5 year after, with\nthat time travel plot. And rework the movie with a better story, or if you can, just give a brief explaination about the\ntime travel plot so that it didnt resulting in a huge paradox like this. For movie goers the current plot is okayish but\nfor scifi nerd this is unacceptable. The lost of one of the avenger is a pure tearjerk but the other one doesnt make any\nsense. It could have been done better with a different character.\nOverall it is okay for entertainment if you dont think too much about it. But I feel unsatisfied with what they are\ndoing. I really do feel it could be better.",

    "reviewBody": "For me the movie felt different than other marvel movies. The pace was slower overall. Cannot say I was fully\nentertained thoughout the entire movie. Trying to give all the characters an adequate screentime and development made\nthis movie so long and wasnt benefical for the tension. It felt really stretched at some points.Thor is literally a joke\nin this movie. One of the most developed and powerful characters we have seen in the past. Would have expected him to\nbeat the **** out of thanos and his troops, but he was pretty much useless in retrospective. Instead we have Captain\nMarvel that outshines the other characters powers by far, plus no one wants to see this because she is just flat and\nunappealing.I also expected more of Thanos, his sudden change of mind wasnt very relatable after the determined /\nbalanced seeming Thanos weve seen in the previous movie. Some things just felt underwhelming about this movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Definitely not what you would expect.",
    "reviewBody": "But I cant really tell if thats a good thing or not.I appreciate that Marvel is trying something different with this\nmovie, that they changed their working formular to create something new, but for me it sadly didnt work out.In\ncomparison to Infinity War, Endgame is just.....nh. Disappointing.\nIf youve seen all the other MCU movies you might get a kick out of all the references and jokes based on those, thats\nthe stuff I greatly enjoyed. Endgame didnt take itself and its characters too seriously and at times this worked out\nreally well. But regretfully, there are others parts where this change of plans destroyed the movie for me.\nI dont know, turning Thor into an alcoholic, lazy dude who does nothing besides playing Fortnite (yes, Fortnite is in\nthis movie) all day just isnt funny at all and ruins the hard work Taika Waititi has put into him. I also hate what\nthey did to Hulk/Banner, I always thought Banner was an extremly likeable and interesting character, but in this movie I\ncouldnt stand him.\nMost of the other characters are just _fine_, Tony and Steve being the only ones who really stand out. Endgame gives\neither of those characters important decisions to make and their dynamic is absolutely entertaining.\nSteves ending though was just awful. Not only was it predictable ever since we knew time travel would be part of the\nplot, it wasnt satisfying at all. Steve leaving his two best friends behind, who he hadnt seen in f i v e years, just\nto hang with the girl he met for a few weeks eighty years ago AFTER he already made out with her niece is just\nunbearable. Awful. Why would you do that.I liked the ending they gave Tony, it was fitting for his character and\nregarding his importance for the whole MCU he deserved a big goodbye.\nTo be honest, I wouldve liked it more if they gave Steve the big, heroic death and let Tony live in retirement with his\nfamily but hey, whatever.So in conclusion, after first watching it I really expected more. This just wasnt the big\nending I was promised, it was weird at times and overall fine at best. I dont think it was necessary to make it three\nhours long. The Russo Brothers directed all of my favourite MCU movies so far, but this one was a total miss.\nWouldnt recommend if youre not a fan.",

    "reviewTitle": "Disappointingly Mediocre",
    "reviewBody": "I want to begin by saying that had this been a standalone movie I would have probably given it a 4 or 5, but for this\nparticular movie, the movie of the decade, the big conclusion everything was leading up to, mediocre-ness is worse than\ncomplete failure. We were promised a masterpiece and we received something that what so-so at best.\nIll break down what I think went wrong, so spoilers ahead:\nThe biggest issue with this movie is the ever-paradoxical use of time travel. Unless you are making a silly comedy like\n\"Back to the Future\" it always messes with continuity and no matter how well you try to explain that the canon reality\ndoes not just collapse under the paradox, it is always going to feel like the lazy way out, and so it did in this one.\nSteve deciding to go rogue back to the 40s, thus ignoring all the character development he went through and irreparably\nmessing with every timeline is not exactly the extremely satisfying closure we were promised in interviews with\ndirectors and actors. Overall I suppose the expectations were just so high that nothing could have lived up to it, but\nwith the amounts of money and the access to great creators Marvel has I really would have expected something else-\nsomething as creative and mind-blowing as they promised instead of the honestly mediocre at best time-travel flick we\ngot. Messing with timelines and essentially de-canonizing large chunks of the MCU just was not what I was hoping for.\nAnother thing I had a problem with is that this movie was supposed to perfectly conclude every characters arc so far.\nWe were promised a suitable ending of some journeys and at least a crucial point in everyone elses. Instead, Black\nWidow was killed without ever even allowing her to develop a character. Thor, who could have been the ideal king of\nAsgard was turned into a fatphobic joke by equating his chubbiness with sloppiness (personally, I liked his new look.\nThor looked rather like a man who is strong from physical labour than planned workouts and diet plans, but the way they\ndressed him in dirty clothes, made him lazy and greasy is just so terrible), while the lessons he learned in Ragnarok\nand the sacrifices he made did not seem to have any effect at all; the loyalty he felt to his people completely\ndisappeared. Iron Man was ripped of his peaceful retirement, where for the first time he was allowed to try to heal,\njust because someone had to die dramatically.\nDont misunderstand me, I am not bitter that they killed off beloved characters, in fact I understand that it had to\nhappen, however I would have loved to see them take the characters arcs into account. In my opinion, Steve should have\ndied because he has no place in either the future or the past, and his mission is completed. Tony, on the other hand,\nshould have lived because he finally made an effort to heal and overcome his trauma. I dont mean to suggest that one or\nanother character should or should not have died, I only think I might have been able to accept the way things turned\nout if there was a reasonable plot leading up to it that made their death a logical conclusion. The Marvel movies are\nfictional and everyone who goes to watch them is very aware of the fact that there is a team of writers and creators who\ncrafted everyones arc and worked on it for a long time. I would have appreciated to watch the outcome reflect the\namount of work and time I am sure many people put into this project.\nUltimately I have to admit that the messages we get to take away from this film are what really made me sad: People with\ntrauma dont deserve to heal, peoples actions and experiences have seemingly no consequences, and friendship and found\nfamily mean nothing against the ideal of a romantic relationship.This is a very long movie and so there are many more\nthings I could address, for example the \"Hail Hydra\" scene, Steve wielding Mjolnir, how similar this movie was to the\nlast one, Lokis unexplained disappearance in the past timeline, the cheap attempt of making up for the lack of lgbt\nheroes by showing a mlm extra in one scene, the list goes on. But all those things seem somehow related to the major\nissues I addressed earlier. Perhaps the hype was too big, perhaps the team did get lazy and rested on the success of the\nfranchise or perhaps it is just me expecting too much from a superhero movie.\nRegardless, if you loved this movie, I see your point, it is in many ways what we were expecting, but what I was hoping\nfor was something new, something revolutionary that would surprise and amaze me. Maybe in another ten or twenty years we\nwill get that movie I thought this was going to be, but I am afraid that by then I will not be interested anymore.",

    "reviewBody": "Ive loved every single Marvel movie because they brought about this level of authenticity, humor, love, loss, failure,\nstrength and a sense of unity to us fans. They werent just movies, they were pure entertainment. Therefore, as much as\nit hurts me to say this, I was terribly disappointed with this movie.Dont get me wrong, there were moments which got me\nthinking, Ok this is it , just to be disappointed again. It was terribly funny to Thor looking fat and drunk but he\nwas pretty much useless through the entire movie. He didnt do anything other than sulk and cry. He didnt even use his\nhammer and it was Captain America that did half the work for him . The entire plot about quantum realm time travelling\nwas so vague that I never understood what was happening. It felt like they thought about time travelling as a last ditch\nattempt to keep the story going. Hulk was the biggest disappointment of them all. Hes supposed to be the strongest\navenger, the mightiest and all that. Instead we get a version of \"Best of both worlds\" ??If I have to compare this to\nany other time travelling movies or shows, lets just say that this movie is the worst of them all. Except for when Tony\nand Natasha die, every other emotional scene felt forced and fake.With regards to Captain Marvel, they neednt have\nwasted their money and time with an introduction movie for her because she didnt do anything in this movie. Fine, she\nblasts through Thanos ship and gives everyone respite from the ceaseless bombings but her only other appearance is\ntwice or thrice. And shes got a cool haircut..",

Let me explain why.1. The whole thing about fortnite, hulk-dabs\nand fatty-Thor was really .. unnecessary. I really love how Marvel use humor in their movies - but this is reaching.2. I\nlove paying for long movies, but I hate checking my watch mid-playtime. It felt like some parts of the movie couldve\nbeen clipped out to keep the flow going a little better.3. The last fight scene has been named by some as one of the\nbest ever on screen. I have to disagree. The clash was both very messy and clumsy. It was hard to focus on what really\nhappened, and it felt like they had to bring just everything without thinking about how it looked on screen. Personally\nI felt nothing special about it, and there were really never a point were i wondered if our heroes would prevail...To\nsum my review up; Marvel has ended one of their best series, and they did it in a decent way. Sadly it feels like they\nare trying to please more children, especially when they force stuff like Fortnite and dabbing into the movie. Im\ndisappointed, but yet I had a good time.",

Each has their moment to\nshine and I truly loved it. The humor was well-used, the story made sense, the finale was downright perfect, and it was\nan all-around great movie!SPOILERS\nMy favorite stuff\nThe beginning with Clints family was downright heartbreaking to watch, and a great way to bring that human aspect to\nthe story, seeing someone who had no idea what was going on be affected by the snapThe subversion of expectation meeting\nthanos and realizing he not only doesnt have the stones but he doesnt carePaul Rudd. What a guy.The second act plot is\nreally done well, it makes sense yet the way they go about it with the callbacks to almost every movie through cameos or\nreliving scenes is great, especially in the New York scenes (specifically the elevator scene from winter soldier being\ncalled back)-Black Widow dying is another expectation subversion and is done very well\nTony having a moment with his dad is great to seeThe way by which thanos is reintroduced as the villain is actually\nbrilliant and gives a new perspective to his motivations and the way he destroys the facility after the reversal snap is\ngreatCap picking up Thors hammer is all kinds of yupGiving our main three some alone time fighting thanos is a great\nway to give them their time to shineAvengers Assemble is everything I didnt know I needed.Tonys arc is done so well\nand how he sacrificed himself reminds me so deeply of the scene in Avengers when cap said tony wouldnt sacrifice\nhimself for others.Cap getting to dance with PeggyThor joins the Guardians!My negative stuff (these didnt really bother\nme that much but a little bit)\nThe whole fat Thor thing kinda makes some of the dramatic moments later on kinda weaker in my opinionSame with\nhalf-hulk, almost felt hard to take him seriously at first but it made more sense as the story grewNot sure I can buy\nthanos changing his mind for his plan to cleanse the universe by destroying it and starting over, but I like that hes\nwilling to die for his own causewouldve liked more action especially in the first act but I appreciated the emotions",

I Think the last Time that happened to\nme was when I first saw LotR 3Even so the movie has its funny scenes it is much darker than most of the previous MCU\nmovies...I really loved that beginning with hawkeye haveing a good time with his family but just seconds later he\nrealized they are all gone cause of thanos snap...\nSo did the end...In a huge battle about Planet earth and the infinity glove You finally get to see that 1 out of 14\nMillion 6 hundred and 5 outcomes Dr. Strange saw... when the whole world and all ever seen MCU heroes fight thanos army\n(brought back by a snap of Hulk with time travelled Infinity gaunlet) Not Thor or Captain Marvel gets the final punch to\nend Thanos... it has to be the one all started with: IRON MAN ... just minutes after he holds Peter in his arms again he\ntakes the Chance to sacrificed himself (he got a daughter with pepper now) and puts on the infinity gaunlet and snap\naway thanos and his army ... but also his Life (as the stones are to powerful) ... that was one hell of an emotional\nscene and that will be forever burnt in my mind\nAnd there are others too that sacrificed their life: black widow gave her life to get hawkeye the soul stone (same as\ngamora did) and cap who is still alive but in his 80s now and took the chance to live his life with peggy while bringing\nback all infinity stones at the end of the movieEveryone knows that this is the best way to end avengers ... a heroic\nmoment for Iron man the guy everything started with and changing his attitude in the best way ever possible...This is a\n10/10 movie because it leaves u speechless...

Maybe\nbesides some... logical issues that always come along with that time travel thing.I was deeply impressed by the CGI,\nthough I normally prefer practical effects. Thanos looked way better than in Infinity.And... I... ok I loved the scene,\nbut... how could Tony even try for a second to use all stones...? Well, it doesnt matter - it was HIS moment.

And from then on, its a post-disaster movie trying to address the previous movies aftermath. All the\nwhile it becomes a Back to the Future-like adventure on steroids and it even has Terminator callbacks as well. And its\ngot the emotional gravitas of Toy Story 3. Oh: and Thors chubby in this, and a MASSIVE troll online whenever Korg needs\nhim to be (in ### ######). Its got taught writing with just as focused direction telling a story through the action as\nopposed to action taking over the story.SEE THIS MOVIE! Its as much movie a movie can get this year!

He was\nstill stuck in the past and life is about dealing with new circumstances and understand some doors are closed forever.\nNot only that, Peggys story as a brave independent woman who fought for a better world loses some meaning.\nIt is also hard to believe Steve Rogers would stay quiet during 70+ years whilst Peggy would do the hard work.\nSteve Rogerss ending is lazy, incoherent and cliche.Black Widow dies, sacrificing herself, meaning any solo movie with\nher is meaningless. Her death as some sense, but it still feels empty.Tony Stark also dies, after having a happy ending\n(at the beginning of the movie). I believe this death is going to be divisive.The loopholes with time travel are there\n(how does Peter resume his life with the same colleagues?) and are kinda disappointing the more you think about\nthem.Marvel really went for the pockets of the consumers and didnt put in the effort to tide things up orderly.",

    "reviewTitle": "Is this a Film or an Epic?",
    "reviewBody": "I dont know if we ever could of imagined the state of Marvel comic-book movies 11 years after the first MCU film in\n2008, to review this film as a movie a one of film, I dont think that would do it justice because as a single stand\nalone film (even though its a sequel) would not do it the proper justice , however this is the only way I know how to\nbreak down a film. I will judge the MCU as a whole in another review. If I was to sum this movie up as brief as possible\nits, Avengers end game is the fan service movie you didnt know you wanted, with a story and battles thrown in there to\npad the run time.\nWhere the movie succeeds is in its grandeur and its design, it is extremely large scale, sometimes to its own detriment\n( I looking at you final battle sequence ) but nevertheless you can feel the immensity of this epic, I will be breaking\nit down into several parts, Story, Cinematography, Actors/Actress , Characters, Motivations, Soundtrack, Pacing, Design,\nRe-watch ability  HeartStory\nwhen you have a story that expands over 20 plus movies to culminate into one it is a hard task, but this movie does\nsucceed in the story it has clear goals, which they seem to accomplish, sometimes without any resistance what so ever,\nthe scene where Tony stark, just happens to make time travel possible after stating it could never be done, was a little\njarring  every obstacle that they did eventually encounter was immediately remedied, antmans a baby then turn the power\noff , couldnt get the correct stone, just go back again, there seemed to be obstacles placed in there way in order for\nthe heroes to just step over them, rather then a climb or hurdle, personally I feel it would have been better to have as\nmany if they were not as significant, the part I loved was in the first act where we see a 5 year jump and the world is\nstill in mourning over the vanishing of half the population, the arc in which Hawk eye is introduced again was a\nsatisfying one, the lead up to the inevitable gathering of all the heroes from earth and beyond was something expected\nin the final act but was done in a way that would even simmer the harshest of critics, the killing of Thanos in the\nfirst 10 minutes was a pleasant surprise, but without a clear antagonist until about 1 hour and 45 minute mark, the\nstory progression took a back seat for character development, Storyline Score 7.5/10Cinematography\nThankfully unlike a lot of the other MCU this film sense of Enormity was done quite well with the cinematography, while\nthe standardised shot, reverse shots were very predominant, there are a few glorious moments, mainly involving the\nquantum realm  the final battle sequence, the colour scenes and lighting are an improvement on Infinity war up until\nthe final battle, but the cold colour pallet sets the mood for a very different MCU film in the beginning ,\nCinematography Score 6/10Actors/Actress\nTo me this is where the movie shines its brightest as there is a range we see from many actors, the desperation in the\nbeginning on Chris Hemsworths face  the slight lip quiver and slightly tearing eyes of Scar-Jo allowed us to see this\nis a passionate cast we are dealing with, the subtleties of almost every actor in this film reflect the minor changes\nthey have from shot to shot, with a show dont tell style which is refreshing for the MCU. Stand-outs are RDJ, Chris\nEvens  Scarlet Johansen\nActor/actress score 8.5/10Characters\nEvery character in this film felt like they had a role to play, and there wasnt too much cross over between them,\nrocket raccoon was the snippy one, ant-man was the comic relief however Thor was a problem to say the least, the running\ngag of him being a fat hair drunk was played up way to much and in almost every scene he was in we are constantly\nreminded that he is drunk and fat and hairy, he was the anti Thor to every other Thor portrayals  it wasnt because of\nwhat he went through it was because of how he was written. The characters develop properly in this and while there isnt\nmany major arcs in the film involving characters the one of Tony stark from, being afraid to do anything because of the\nfear of losing his daughter or his daughter losing him transcending into the hero that defeated Thanos and died in the\nprocess, was not only touching but poetic, the sounds of sobbing where heard in the theatres and it was a (forgive the\npun) stark reminder of what the characters mean to people here in the real world. Character score 7/10Motivations\nEvery movie has the characters that motivations make no sense - this film is no different , however as of writing this,\nI cannot find a world breaking character motivation that took me away from the film, they all had goals and did what\nthey needed to do to achieve those goals. With one of the exception, when evil nebula comes back from the past, everyone\nseems to forget about her while sorting out the infinity stones, which felt like a plot device to allow her to bring\nThanos to the future.\nMotivations 9/10Soundtrack\nThe best part of the score was the nostalgic soundtracks when different characters were introduced and combined with the\ncurrent score, the music in this film is generic and nothing to write home to, there is a distinct lack of strong\nmotivating soundtrack to pump you up nor one to bring you down when needed, for me this was one of the most disjointing\nparts of the film .Soundtrack score 3/10Pacing\nThe film has a pacing issue, go figure a 3 hour movie with a pacing issue, there are scenes and segments where it is\nclear, this section is for laughing, this section is for going wow, this is the sad section and felt extremely\nstretched, the first 1 hour and a half was the hardest part to get through pacing wise, when we are so used to a full\nfilm being over by this stage, I feel there is many parts of this film that could be cut out to make it more streamline\nwithout compromising the final product.\nThe final act approx 1 hour 10 minutes of the film goes extremely fast while the first 2 acts seem to almost double in\nlength when watching it. Pacing score 5/10Design\nThere is not much to say about the design of the world they create, everything is as it should be, the time machine\nlooked great and believable, Thanos ships  warriors, every planet (most of which we have seen before) were done almost\nflawlessly - the only concern I had was the look of Thanos when moved and fought, seemed extremely ridged and choppy,\nnot sure if that is to do with where I watched it on, but it was jarring. Design score 8.5 out of 10Re-watch ability\nThis is where this part of the review gets tricky, there are parts that are extremely fun and enjoyable to watch over\nand over again, give me the first 15 minutes and the last hour, but to go through the choppy paced part of the film when\nyou already know what is happening, is a task, a movie like this which has many ups and downs within it, its a journey\nand one I will not be partaking a 3rd time any time soon. It does take a lot out of you physically and emotionally \nreliving those emotional moments tends to make them less of an impact  with those moment this films climax would not\nstand up. Re-watch ability score 6/10Heart\nThis movie does have heart, it is the one key factor that I find in more of the grittier comicbook film I tend to enjoy\nmore, there is a joyfulness that is thrown in there in times of stress , undercutting the tension of the film, this is\nwhat I call marvel-ing for everything serious you have you must immediately undercut it with something else, normally\nthis is one of my biggest pet peeves about marvel films as of late but for what ever within the confines of this film I\nfelt them more necessary then ever, the characters interaction with each other and the care you can see is not just an\nact make this movie much more than I expected. Heart score 9/10\nAdding the totals I give the film a review of 70.5% Making it the 5th highest aggregate score\nThat being Said, I did thoroughly enjoy the film and do recommend it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not actioned packed however...nice wrap up!",
    "reviewBody": "The bulk of the film is set five years after the events of Infinity Wars.Ok lets start with the negatives:\nCGI of some of our favourite characters appear to be slightly on the poor side. The CGI is quite noticable in some\nscenes.Secondly...Its very long and as a whole does not have much action. It is more dramatic. This is not a bad thing,\nhowever some fans may expect more action in this genre of film.On a postive note, it brings the characters back together\nvery well.Unfortunately it appears this film too has become a victim of \"feminism\", with an unnecessary girl power \"we\ngot this\" scene featuring Captain Marvel and a number of supporting female cast. Why unnecessary? Because viewers will\nnote that Captain Marvel could have quite easily conducted the task at hand with little or no assistance.The cast have\ndone a great job with plenty of little cameos from our favourite and not so favourite characters of the MCU. The film\npresents itself as a good wrap up to the 22 film series. Prepare yourselves for some laughs and for some\ntears.Btw...there is no post credit scene so no need to wait till the end of the rolling credits.If you have an\nopportunity, go watch the film at the cinemas as it is still worth the watch in a cinematic environment. Just make sure\nyou go to the toilet before the movie starts due to the length of the film.Happy watching!A job well done to both\nproducers and directors.",

    "reviewTitle": "Flash Review: A must for MCU fans, but dont think too hard",
    "reviewBody": "The Set-upThe Time Travel plot device to end the Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been speculated ever since\nthe post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp showed Scott Lang/Ant-Man getting trapped in the Quantum Realm.Any time\nyou use Time Travel as a plot device in a movie, it raises a LOT of questions on how paradoxes are avoided. BUT this is\na Marvel movie, so we wave our Sorcerer Supreme hands and ignore things that would be scrutinized in a hard science\nfiction film.So. Three acts.First Act: The StakesTo me this was the best part of the whole movie. We visit with the\noriginal Avengers, first a few days after the events of Infinity War, then again five years later to see how theyre\ndealing with their losses. This is the difference between the MCU and the DCEU - the MCU spends time with the\ncharacters motivations and the stakes involved. When they fight not just another meaningless CGI-laden battle. This act\nends with the return of Scott Lang and the formulation of the plan to recover the people Thanos killed in Infinity\nWar.Second Act: The HeistsIts fitting that Ant-Man triggers this series of events, because this act feels like the\noriginal Ant-Man movie. Still a lot of nice interaction between the surviving heroes, and the environments that they\nvisit. The act ends when they all succeed, but at what price?Third Act: The EndgameOf course theres a final battle to\nend the movie and the current Phase of the MCU, complete with transitions, consequences, surprises and all-out CGI\naction as only the Russos can deliver. Its a totally satisfying climactic encounter.EpiloguePeriods and question marks\nfor the characters that weve journeyed with for twenty-two films.Post-credits scenesThere arent any. Unless you count\na post-credits sound effect, which could mean anything.Reviewers Tilt7/10. Unfortunately I think about time travel plot\nholes too much, and this impacts how much I enjoyed the movie, so I docked it a point for that, but its still a solid\nentry and a worthwhile end to this Phase of the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Well made ending of an era but the execution was lazy",
    "reviewBody": "First of all, from a critics perspective, the movie had everything to be a complete success. The visuals were amazing,\nthe soundtrack was a perfect underline to every scene and the plot contained several unexpected twists. However, the\nmovie just didnt do it for me personally.Before I start complaining, I went in that movie with high expactations, due\nto it being the grand finale to an 11 years ongoing era, but was open for everything to happen.Except for just enough\nthings that made me feel like it wasnt the finale I wished to see.Starting with the attack on Thanos in the first part\nof the movie. It was too fast and too easy to be the follow up of Infinity War. Thanos killed our beloved characters but\nthe revenge for it just wasnt satisfiying and felt like they want to get rid of him as fast as possible just to bring\nhis former conquerer self on screen to have a villain to fight.\nIt was surprising, but it wasnt a good surprise.Second, the humour felt kinda off. Dont get me wrong, the jokes were\ngreat and I laughed at some of them, but often they were misplaced. For such a serious situation, there were to many\njokes.\nFat Thor was hilarious, but I would have liked this in the probably upcoming Asguardians of the galaxy movie, where they\njust chill in space and get fat, but not in the finale of an era.The solution for defeating Thanos, undo the snap and\nwhat they had to do for it were just to easy. I never had the feeling, that they were risking something. For every\nproblem, there was a fast solution. There wasnt a moment where the stakes were high. It felt like \"yeah just do\nit\".Additionally, I think the Russo brothers went full safe mode with the happenings. Everything the fans wanted to see\nwas in it. Wich sounds great, but there wasnt any real surprise. It felt like I knew exactly what will happen next and\nhow the movie ends (just a note here: I tried to avoid any trailers or theories, so I went in that movie only with my\nown thoughts about it). It was indeed a good storyline, but way to predictable.Also, the movie was slow paced, but the\nimportant scenes, for example the comeback of all characters at the final battle, did not have enough time to breathe.\nThere was so much happening at that battle, that every reunion was so fast and rushed. More time for it would have made\nit more emotional.These are just a few things that bothered me. Nevertheless there are a lot of good things as well.The\nmovie took its time to have as much of a goodbye to the characters as possible.\nThe chemistry between the characters was on point.\nThe timetravels to the old movies were a great recap of what happened.\nTonys death and the funeral were emotional as hell.Overall, the movie just isnt the worthy finale for an unbelievebly\nwell made cinematic universe. It did everything to be a good ending but lacked the surprises as a consequence. It is a\nmust watch for fans, but as a movie itself it is by far not as good as Infinity War.",

The overall humor didnt do the movie any good. The Thor is fat and the Hulk is both\nstrong and smart joke got old really fast. I fellt like the movie wasnt insink with the first one.The ending was\nsatisfying but didnt make up for the rest.The first acts of the movie really were promissing but they lost it somewhere\nin the middel. This one is a 7 and the first one a 9.My overal problem is that this movie misses the pace the first one\nhad.So go watch the movie and see it yourself.",

They didnt\nreally came true though...Its absolutely worth the watch, but I think people, just like me, might be a bit\ndisappointed.I think certain characters got way too much screentime like hawkeye and captain america, while others got\nway too little.\nSome scenes really could be skipped, theres so much unnecessary talking and just too little action.Im a huge Loki fan,\nso i really hoped he would return and would get a bigger role in this one, but elas... he is in it, luckily, but way too\nshort. A really big missed upportunity. Of course they brought Gamora back, but no Loki.... :(\nThe directors just dismissed him as they have their obvious favorite characters.Thor being fat and all was funny in the\nbeginning but later it just annoyed me. Why doing this to this great character?!Tony was great, cried my eyes out during\nhis death scene and funeral, but the ending with cap... why give his shield to Falcon?!Many missed opportunities. The\nstory could have been much more interesting than this obvious ending.To end positive, the special effects were amazing.\nYou have to see this on the bigscreen.\nThe acting itself is also great.\nSo definitely worth watching, but dont expect too much ;)",

What about the lack of food and other factors? Its just lazy\nhorrible writing.The \"Girl Power\" scene - I get it; I get the female cause, I get wanting a Black Captain America to get\nthat Black Panther dollar too - but its such lazy writing to have them all find each other on a battle field in that\nparticular way.Were to believe Captain America from 1940 goes back to be with Peggy (now in her late forties, early\n50s) and lives a life where he watches his friend Bucky get tortured by Hydra, Shield be betrayed by Hydra despite his\nwife being a director and all the other travesties so he can just \"live his life\"The bitter-sweet \"But Tony and Pepper\nhave a kid\" - I think the sacrifice that could and should have been made is for Tony to realise that he has to give away\nthe kid in order to return those that were lost to the decimation; i.e the click undoes the last five years and brings\nthem back to the instant that Thanos clicked..",

    "reviewBody": "Big Marvel fan!! Wanted to get that out of the way before I start!Its just that the way Infinity war was directed and\nhandled overall, Endgame had to up its game and thats where it fell a bit short, I feel. I knew time travel was always\nin play(so its not even a spoiler); however the direction, screenplay and science of time travel part was weakly\nhandled. I am a huge time travel concept fan(Primer and Time crimes being the best). With the slow pace in the 1st act\nestablishing the foundation for the rest of the movie, I thought they would do justice to the science, implication and\nthe wit of time travel. So I expected a mature take on it. Three things could have been better to complete the time\ntravel ark:-\n1. The ripples it created in the alternate timeline were spoken of but not addressed at all when things started to go\nsouth in the original timeline.\n2. Smart inserts of how original movies had certain scenes which were inexplicible then could have been attributed to\nthis movies time travel plot. Eg. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the russtle of leaves heard by Hermoine\ninitially was understood when the time travel ark started. Something like that would have made a true Marvel fan giggle\nwith delight. Missed a trick there.\n3. Hulk explained that putting the stones back in its place will kill the offshoot timelines - meaning it could possibly\ninvalidate the movies timeline too!! But that was not addressed; am sure story writers had thought this through, just\ncouldnt translate that in the screenplay.Its best moments can be summarized under 2 points:-\n1. Humor (not top grade...nonethess prevalent throughout the movie)\n2. NostalgiaBest handled characters in following order:-\n1. Iron Man\n2. Captain America\n3. Thor\n4. Hulk\n5. Hawkeye andRaw deal for characters which were seemingly important for Phase 4 of MCU\n1. Black Widow\n2. Thanos\n2. Dr. Strange\n3. Spiderman\n4. Black Panther\n5. Vision (no screen time??! Unless you consider Howard Starks driver Jarviss voice)Although, I seem to be cynical\nrather than delighted fan with this review, overall I enjoyed the movie; worth a re-watch to catch the missed 1 one\nliners :)And if someone at Marvel is looking for Ideas to cash-in on nostalgia, Captain Americas final scene can be a\nmovie in itself(and hopefully someone will consider in future)!!!Good Luck Marvel...for Phase 4!...Looking forward to!",

    "reviewBody": "I didnt know I was a fan but I was... ButFor the genre not the movie itself.I get fueled by heroism however seeing all\nthe movies and have read 0 comics seen some animated series this end was good not great.A overal weak 6.5-6.7I am no\ngeek for the whole package, franchise but in the impossible.I am here to share my emotions after 0 credit scene and I am\nfull of emotions but confused, sad, empty, serenity.So I am no indepth with writers on this but I do get you want to\nplease everyone but it becomes too much, the Thor part is probably great for many none followers and just for the\naverage viewer, I dont think it is the writers fault but the management, vision.Cause this might the fastest 3 h you\nsit through and wonder what was what happens and you are left with the will of reseeing it and not in a good way.It\nmight just be me or how I am built but even if it is 2019 and the world is what it is and actors want out, age or what\nnot (didnt stop the cgi) it does get better with time, hence live action.So removing cast completely is just so\nredundant. This genre is made for the impossible why make it not so, why try and please the other half. It is not that\nit is unrealistic most is.People spend time remenissing most part of their life or doing things they didnt believe in\nuntil they started doing it.Sure raw and gritty but that is why you should never close a door not in this age.Having\ncast return should always stay open especially if you even after 2008, mind the comics, the length characters have lived\neven thou animated there could have been openings because the way the closed this chapter is and was rushed.This comes\nfrom me and my emotions, even my girlfriend said it was flat.Well ofcourse it was, so many characters in this with 1/3\ngoing for slowpace, drama, not even enough time to shift paste.It is like they wanted to keep the same and all emotions\nfrom all movies and still build a story ontop and this in 3 hours time.I am all for everything and I dont need more,\nthis is Imdb. Just using this to lead my emotions for selfclosure where the creators did not.I wish I could say all CGI\nin the final would satisfy me, pepper Potts spot on send off, every moment but it was a cake, you hade the sprinkle, you\nhad layers, you had frosting but where was the passion, there was humor.You know trying to digg out something that is\nleft missing is not easy, even if one would rage.So my gf said it was flat, as for me vs those who have more backstory\nand are more forgiving and accept noone can live forever.I get you. I might be that 1 procent but I am still here\nfeeling a bit snuffed because we left the impossible behind.Maybe we dont live in a sustainable world anymore and it\ndrives us to be more realistic and we are controlled more about numbers than guided by our own emotions.But ending it\nlike this feels wrong, so for one printing this directly from my mind and beeing a post genius would could have been\ndifferent?Well honestly it is not hard to speak for oneself.And you cant change the past as in the movies (yet)However\nplaying with the idea is that pushing the soul stone a definite broke it all but going deeper on the same line would\ndrag things out til the impossible.So giving the time concept multiverse would be the way to go, however. Martyrs are no\nlonger and should have and shall never be glorified even if that embarks emotions.A true hero is one that can overcome\nall without self-sacrifice.I think this would and should have been the call.This leads us back to infinity war and just\nthe strange writer decision to brand and spoil the envitable plot with the 14 miljon vs 1 outcome.For a company as any\ncompany with leaders, writers above all people with vision.A person in time gets better. An object that gets older you\nthreat it with more respect.But with this it seems money and time talks more against than for.It is truly sad that crowd\ncreation and funding didnt go through n before this era for fans and other followers to inject their will into the\nstory arch as it could have.Opens up interesting view upon those who own the rights to shape and have the power to push\nplot, characters.For one second could have been nice with alternative ending because like Strange writers did it, 14\nmiljon wrong and one right.However this feel like inaccurate as for realities, infinity the soul stone sacrifice seems\nto be the only limit.So what is next. Well for me I will mourn Ironman the most as for the rest not as much but\nstill..It is just truly sad everything was pushed to an end than actually have a more organic fallout.Seeing heroes grow\nold naturally, no time jumping leaving things over in the same pace it has been would have been nice.If I could ask a\nquestion it would have been.Why or who made you quit, was it not obvious it was done. Who pushed who, who got left\nbehind so this happened.Was it really time for RDJ to go. And I believe not. This gap needs to be filled and if it was\nthat easy we would have, his portrayed or joint mentality for, in and with his character people need it and copy or act\nit will not be possible, this is core grinded with each and one of us acting or not and cannot be copied and another\nreplacing will not be possible cause we all realisticly could(have) see(seen) RDJ continue his journey.And this is just\nRDJ, there are more which falls into the same line. It is just me who connects with RDJ the strongest hence the\nreference.So needed to spend time writing this up to be able to go to sleep is not as good as I had hoped.But in the\nworld we are shapeing it helps with the impossible when everyone else fails.Let that be a reminder./Cheers n take care\n3",

    "reviewBody": "I watched this movie at the world premiere and I am absolutely speechless by the work they have done.The pacing is\nincredibly good, It doesnt feel like you sit there for 3hrs, more like 1 hr 50 min.The time travel aspect actually\nworks in this movie which I like, because many movies tries time travel and it never really works or it is super\ncomplicated. The only thing I dont like about this is this is going to become such a \"Deus ex Machina\" to the franchise\ngoing on.There was one death that shocked me and the ending to the top 2 avengers were great. Iron man and Captain\nAmerica both went out with the way I wanted them to go.I also love that characters like Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Nebula and\nHulk got so much screen time.The only things I did not like about this movie is the business aspect. Its very obvious\nthat Audi has a deal with Marvel when Tony Stark drives his Audi and parks it in front of the camera for 5 seconds\nflashing the logo. I also did not like the Fortnite reference with Thor and Korg. The kids in the cinema loved it but it\njust got way to corny.My favorite quote from the movie is Tony Starks reference to \"The Big Lebowski\" that was\npersonally my favorite joke.Marvel did it again and I seriously dont know how they can top this in phase 4.\nThank you to the Russo brothers for making an incredible masterpiece9/10",

It transformed the prosaic characters - the normal to\nProfessor Hulk, the muscular to the rotund Thor which elicited laughter and so much humor. The clever plot and\naction-combat that kept me glued to the chair for 180 minutes.I enjoyed this movie a lot and has always been a fan of\ncomics esp. The Avengers. For the records, Chris Evans which played Captain America handed an adamantium shied to a\nsuccessor. Chris Evans is irreplaceable. I am not sure whether to watch Captain America sequel again under different\nrole. Both characters are awesome.Robert Downey Jr. died. The ever gorgeous Scarlett Johansson died. I am quite sure\nmarvel will find a way to undo their death as how the vanished halves of the superheroes were brought back to life in\nthe movie. Avengers will no longer be that great without the abovesaid names playing respective superheroes - because\nEvans, Johansson, and downey Jr. are indispensable! I don;t care if Tobey McGuire is substituted.10/10 and I am waiting\nto see whether this mega-blockbuster could beat Titanic as No. 1 highest grossing movie of all time....",

    "reviewTitle": "Definitely worth seeing",
    "reviewBody": "As a casual fan of the MCU (watched most movies, read no comics) it didnt have such an impact on me but it was an\nenjoyable ride all the same. I was worried at the beginning that the three hours would drag (some scenes were padded,\nshall we say) but it was no difficulty. Though there was surprisingly little action, it kept my attention throughout. I\ndid find myself getting lost occasionally with all the references to previous movies that I simply couldnt remember\nwell enough.A scene I found particularly effective was the opening with Hawkeyes family. I thought it did well to\nremind us where we left off without retreading the same ground as before.I found one plot point particularly confusing.\nI thought Thanos had to sacrifice the thing most dear to him who was coincidentally beside him in the previous movie yet\nhere it seemed like the soul stone just requires whoever happens to be standing next to you. Ive got to say the image\nof the dead body was my favourite though, absolutely stunning.As for humour, some felt misplaced and fell flat but there\nwere a few hilarious moments for sure. Thor is essentially comic relief which may not please some but I enjoyed almost\nall of his scenes. I just think Chris Hemsworth is such a pro at his delivery.Overall it was a tremendous effort to try\nto wrap up so many stories in a satisfying way. For most I imagine it will be successful, I just felt it tied too neat a\nbow on everything. Ive got to say I wanted a higher body count, further showing my morbid taste. I had no significant\nattachment to the characters so my eyes remained completely dry as we progressed through the farewells which rival LOTR\nfor length if not emotion. It was still a very enjoyable ride. I would say Infinity War was more thrilling but Endgame\nwas more polished. Definitely worth a watch.",

    "reviewTitle": "Near-Perfect Ending",
    "reviewBody": "As the curtain comes down on this phase of MCU films I really need to taper off my rating (just a tad) to ensure I give\nthis film a fair review.The cinematography in this film is 10/10, as well as the sheer tenacity of the plot - and the\nthreads they had to weave to connect it all together in one 3-hour long ride. They have done this to perfection. The\nutilisation of the different timeframes make for something that no other film has done before, or ever will again. Ill\nleave this there, as every review will no doubt focus on the positives, Ill focus on the negatives (and keep in mind\nthis movie is still an amazing, 9/10 in my book).One of my gripes do begin with the timeframes they use though, as the\n\"teams\" they split off into dont all make for the most compelling of stories. War Machine and Nebula didnt add much in\nthe storyline. And even with her doppelgnger taking her place, in the end that didnt really end up going anywhere\nexcept to drive Thanos to come to heads with The Avengers back on earth. This is one thing I think they couldve done in\na better way, potentially replacing the \"doppelgnger\" plot driver to maybe another battle (mid-movie) involving Thanks,\nthat then shapes the rest of the movie.Another gripe is Thor. My personal favourite of the MCU, he (as others have\nmentioned) is a running joke throughout the whole movie. I wouldve been fine with a quick 30 second montage to see\nthe God (yes that is important to note as well) get back in shape. It was simply not befitting to the character we\nhave spent so much time with over the years.The one gripe I am MOST annoyed about (if you can call it annoyance, is\nthe fact that in the end, the stakes were lowered by the fact that there was only 1 character death in the whole of the\nfinal battle. Unless I am missing something here amongst all that carnage!\nThe fact that all but one (not counting Black Widow) Avenger gets to have their ride off into the sunset happy ending\nis a bit of a downer for me. I could rewatch that whole sequence (and Im sure I will) and know that everyone but\nIronman is going to be fine. I realise there still needs to be a lot of heroes left to continue on with solo films again\n(after Endgame). But I feel we shouldve seen 3-4 deaths from some of Bucky, War Machine, Drax, Mantis, Scarlett Witch,\nWong and a few others could have met their end.Apologies if I missed a death in there, I know Thanos used the power\nstone on someone which may very well have been a death, however its 1:14am as I type this.But if youve read this far,\nthank you",

    "reviewBody": "To start off, i would give it 9.5 if i could. To say this movie is good is an understatement. The fact that this even\nexist should not be possible yet it is and somehow it doesnt only exists. Its also great. I somewhat feel like this is\nsomething that is looked over. People are taking this stuff for granted. I repeat myself in saying. This should not\nexists. There shouldnt be 22 movies within the same franchise that all are this well connected and not to mention that\nliterally each and every one (with few exceptions) are either good, great or mediocre. Not one that is objectivly bad,\nexcept maybe Thor 2...The mere fact is that they built up for this conclusion in 10 years worth of movies and the result\nis a movie that is consistent, true to the character and established world and is most importantly still enjoyable. This\nis very much an end of an era and they couldnt have done it better.Now bellow will be spoilers so if you for some\nreason ignored the spoiler wanring and read this far i advice you not to continue. You want to see this movie with no\nknowledge.The ending for our main heroes is great. Lets start by saying that keeping Thor is great, his character still\nhas a place to grow from and i think he will fit with the Guardians.Steve Rogers. I would have been satisfied and not\nsurprised if they chose to end him in battle. Yet they made something so much more beautiful. I cannot stress enough how\nperfect his ending is. Leaving over the shield. But most importantly, retiring. He was a soldier but even those need to\nsettle down. The ending shot of him with Peggy dancing is one of the most beautiful parts of any marvel movie if not the\nbest. Such a great way to end his story - where he started. In a life that was stolen.Tony goddamned Stark. There\ncouldnt have ended in any other way. Tony is a fighter, no matter how much he tries to fool himself he will always\nfight. Unoike Steve he could never live out his life in peace, this is why his ending is so perfect. Doing whats right.\nFor the better of others. From his last words to his voice memo telling his daughter he loves her 3000. Tony Stark does\nhave a heart.The plot is also something ill briefly comment on. What a great way to end such an epic and long stort -\nby literally going back to where it started. They made sure the infinity stones would be gone and yet made a conclusive\nand good way to do it. They made the losses feel real and you were on the edge of your seat watching.Lastly i want to\nexplaib why it isnt a 10 in my book. Now obviiusly for a 10 the lovie ought to be perfect and while i biew this to be\nso in many ways there are a few small issues i had. I really felt like some of the jokes, such as the fortnite one,\ndidnt really fit for me. Ialso still think Cpt Marvel is overpowered and boring - however they made sure to keeo her\naway which i appreciated. I also disliked the cgi on Thors Peter B Parker belly. These are just nitpicks and overall\nthey didnt stop me from lovint this lovie.Tl;dr APPRECIATE THIS, Remember that this movie should bot be possible yet it\nis and its great. Watch it and enjoy it. Dont spoil it for anyone though.",

    "reviewTitle": "GREATEST MOVIE",
    "reviewBody": "I have already written a review but I wanna say that this movie was amazing, but they made past thanos far too strong,\nhe was able to beat every single avenger and bearly bleed. They made Thor like 80% weaker in this than infinity war, and\ndisappointed me in the last 5-10mins with making captain America too old to be an avenger meaning they lose three\navengers to death ( as cap would be dying by age ), Thor too fat, hulk has a burnt arm and hawk eye is a father.\nNow with the positives this is my favourite marvel/ action/ superhero movie. This has the BEST end fight scene, great\naction scenes, emotional and humorous scenes. I laughed, clapped and was nearly going to cry as some of the best\navengers dies, and the others physically cannot go on anymore as an avenger. This really wraps up the infinity saga and\nthe Russos have our done themselves and Stan ( then man ) Lee would be very proud. The movie had a great twist to it\nand really surprised me. Many times my heart was racing throughout the movie. The movies worth every minute. So get up\nget out that door and watch this movie over and over again as it is the last movie for some of our favourite cast. And\ndont forget your tissues.",

    "reviewTitle": "Sigh, it was everything that was expected (Spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "TL;DR: A lot of rambling from me, wished for more epic ending.What an utter and complete disappointment. Gonna list some\nthings I didnt like first.I went to this movie with expectations that Tony is the one to die from the Big 3. Reasoning\nbeing that in my opinion ( Since seeing ending of BP) Marvel is obviously setting MJ (Spider-Man) to be a Power Duo with\nShuri ( Black Panthers Sister) now that she is head of the Wakandas NY Embassy. and hey someone needs to fix\nSpider-Mans new nanosuit right? Iron Woman inc? MJ can take Peppers suit, and someone can post on Reddit how Chekovs\nGun her reading a Recycling book was.Really disappointed for that tony death, even more disappointed how they handled\nit.Time travel also happens, that was lame AF. I hoped writers would have actually surprised us, feels like shitty\nwriting.Complete victory. Traded Black Widow and Stark for victory? Talk about a cheap win.\nThere was no point in the movie were it felt like the stakes were high and Avengers were actually losing something. From\nstart to finish its just a victory parade IMO.\nSerious lack of dialogue! I really wanted more 1 on 1 discussions between the characters I.E Bucky and Captain talking\nbefore he time jumps at the end, Nebula commenting on why she shot herself, Myabe Thanos commenting that maybe he lacked\nexperience that 9 year older Thanos had, Captain Marvel speaking whole sentence, or just something!\nMost discussions between characters were just humor stuff , nothing meaningful or long. Dialogue really feels soulless\nto me, factory mill quality.MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, so ruined RUINED I SAY, if u remember at the end of Infinity War, We\nsee Thanos Hut, well when I saw it first time, I thought it was Hawkeyes Hut. I was expecting to see Hawkeye happy and\nsmiling eating with his family when the SNAP happens, and he has to watch everyone dust while passing the salad. God\ndamn the Endgame scene of dusting his family lacks any emotional impact. and the Hawkeyes actor could have carried that\nscene 100%! His face on Endgame trailer, really says how ashamed he is what he has become, how he is angry at himself\nand the shame he feels because Nat saw him like that. This was the thing I was most hyped about!!! and talking about\nlack of dialogue man Hawkeye - Captain America interaction would have been nice.I wish they had spent more effort on the\n#Metoo scene. I hate to call it that. but that is what it felt like. It should have been longer. No actress got to\nreally do anything on that, and I still didnt get my fill of Pepper Potts being a badass warrior, just like with Iron\nMan 3. Also pissed that Maria Hill wasnt included (not even in the movie god damn). Maybe Marvel hates Canada (hi\nmum!). Worst thing about it was how Valkyries Pegasus was completely fine after taking a shot from the Mothership\ncannon, even all pure white still lol.Falcon becoming Captain America and Valkyrie becoming a Queen , both come out of\nleft field for me. When did Valkyrie show any leadership qualities? Bizarre.\nAnd on Falcons case it doesnt feel like he has earned it. at least not yet. Guess I am excited for Falcon solo movie\nnow and reserve judgement until then on that call.Oh yeah, Lokis death received no mention in whole movie huh. also\nshame no Hela. Would have loved to see Thor ask about her from the Mother.Black Order was a joke, again, just like in\nIW, although way bigger joke this time around. Shame.Soulstone Gang each getting a action scene looked hilarious stupid\nto me. Okey 1st Spider-Man show you are here, now Panther, Strange get the ocean and so on.\nThis is the Final Movie, how the hell do u not top all the other Avenger group battle scenes by miles?? Lack of effort\nis insane IMO. Yes I like Portals but am not giving a free pass because of them god damnit.Marvel failed to stop the\nCaptain marvel Deus Ex Machina.I would have appreciated a better,longer fight scene with Danvers and Thanos. That Scene\nreally felt like a writer was jerking off \" Look u baby audience am empowering a woman and giving Stark idea what to do,\nI AM A GENIUS\" . Sorry, it just looked so cliche and stupid easy. Would probably have been fine without the\nStrange-Stark eye-to-eye stuff. Cinematography left a lot to be desired on all that.Would have liked to see bigger\nmovement to try to move on after the snap than just an AA meeting.Wanted more Nebula-Stark scenes.\nThen NEUTRAL STUFF, all this stuff felt like \"duh obviously, its not like anything eelse even could happen, but it was\nstill good\"Hulk Fusion\nHawkeye-Black Widow exchange\nCaptain America staying backThe GOOD STUFF\nThors depression. I dont have the writing skills to praise enough Hemsworths performance or writing on that. He was\ndefinitely my favorite part of this movie. Just a shame that him being little chubby didnt show in the fight scenes or\nimpact his fighting ability.\nCaptain getting the Scepter with \"Hail Hydra\" . also love that they teased a elevator fight. Will probably watch Winter\nSoldier tomorrow!Captain America and the Hammer, expected , but damn I love how he fights with the hammer.Rating:I am\ngiving this movie the lowest marvel movie rating I have ever given. It is not the worst Marvel movie for me, that Honor\nbelongs to Dr. Strange (its so damn boring and slow paced and I even love all the actors in it), BUT this is supposed to\nbe the epic finale for the 1st arch of MCU, and in that it utterly fails. and the score reflects that failure.It also\nsuffers from Infinity War (My favorite MCU Movie) being so damn good, and pales in comparison sadly.This really reminds\nme of how my favorite Game of Thrones episodes are mostly 2nd last episodes and how I havent liked almost any of the\nseason endings.If I would have to guess, its because when you are good at writing, there is one logical outcome that\nfits the story you have been building and people that have seen a lot of movies, can figure it out. And I hate having\nfigured out the story, I always want to be surprised when watching a movie! For it to go far and beyond my expectations.\nDidnt happen this time.Thanks for bothering to read this if you did!",

After the amazing first 20 minutes, was too many jokes that shifted the whole thing away. For example hulk was way\noff and turning one of the strongest characters in history into a fat , drunk man!! Come on.\n2. The time-travel-solution was so predictable but Thanos intervening using nebula saved the night.\n3. Ioved the Lokis scene and whole thing back in 2012\n4. Cap. America saying heil hydra  him holding the hammer\n5. The scene where all the female characters protecting the gauntlet was amazing\n6. Tony hugging peter overwhelmed everyone\n7. The comeback of the snapped champs right away to the battle \n8. Falcon becomes the new cap is lame\n9. I expected much more from Thanos and Thor ( considering his role and his Strombreaker in infinity war)\n10. Tony Stark left me speechless, Was pissed off at the beginning but then thought he got his epic ending fitting his\nrule and importance in MCU. He will be missedYet Amazing , entertaining and breathtaking movie and nice budget bringing\nback almost everyone.\nAn end of era!!!",

    "reviewBody": "The story was really good and there are a lot of funny moments in this movie and also prepare to cry. But there are a\nfew scenes that I did not like.1. Fortnite. When they showed this (in my opinion) terrible game it did completely\ndestroy the immersion for me during this scene. It simply was extremely out of place.2. It was weird how Thor got his\nhammer \"back\". This was in the past and the Thor from that timeline was also there so our Thor basically stole the\nhammer from that past timeline Thor. Nobody mentioned this and Frigga did not seem to care at all. I was expecting the\nother Thor to try and get his own hammer back but nothing happened. It was really odd. Also speaking of Thor, I didnt\nlike that they made him look all chubby and turn him into an alcoholic. It was funny at first but later I just wanted\nthe old Thor back. Hopefully in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 he will get his normal look again.3. The movie indeed was\npredictable for the most part. I did not expect Black Widow to die though, that was a shocker for me.Everything else was\nperfect and expecially that final battle with Thanos was just spectacular. I had goosebumps many times. Tonys death was\nthe saddest part of the movie and in my Theatre many people cried. I also had to fight with tears. I thought I was\nprepared but it hit me too hard. Tony always was my favourite Character but he got the perfect ending. Giving his life\nto save the world.",

Probably not - until the DVD comes out.Ive\nseen infinity war at least 5 times, and its one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for\nsure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no\nscreen time, where others had too much.Its just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much\nbetter, with just as many characters. I just cant put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half\nlacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They\ncant reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and thats alright.All in all, the movie\nwas a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. Its not a perfect\nfilm, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things\nthey wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",

    "reviewBody": "I feel like Im wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic)\ncould say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it\nat a preview screening, I cant help but say a few spoiler-free words.Im not your average fanboy -- most long-running\nfranchises have bored me at this point, and I couldnt care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there\nwill be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid\nentries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after\nInfinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few\nhighly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. Its the perfect follow up to\nInfinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. Its hard to see how theyll be able to top this one.Its\nsurprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there),\nemotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most Ive\nlaughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, its a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the\nepic battle stakes), and even though its three hours long, it doesnt feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my\nwatch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, its a superhero movie, but an immensely\nentertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references\nand inside jokes to reward the faithful).If \"Return of the King\" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars\nAvengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. Its as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre\nseries as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it.",

    "reviewTitle": "A fitting farewell to an incredible era",
    "reviewBody": "DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 years of top quality entertainment and planning\nthat started all the way back with 2008s surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of\nMarvels world domination comes to an end with whats likely to be one of, if not the biggest films of all time, The\nAvengers: Endgame.Its a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this\npart of the Marvel universe and while we know theres countless more Marvel films coming our way, Endgame really does\nfeel like the culmination of years of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to\nwhats come before and what still lays ahead.Its incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the\nnarrative the Russo brothers and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have\ngiven us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, thats likely to please diehard fans and more casual\ncinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to its genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor,\nEndgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.Its picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel\nexperience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, its not as all\nencompassing as last years experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so\nmany loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the years.A lot of these endings and plot tie\nups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a\nnumber of years, its just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot\nthreads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is\nEndgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged\ninstances, theres a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and covers similar ground\none too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russos film never is too detrimental to the fun to be\nhad.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thors new found lifestyle, the Hulks more prominent\nrole and Captain Marvels addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said arent\nthat abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as,\nif not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, its been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no\noutright failures and an abundance of big winners, weve been spoilt for 11 straight years and while Endgame may not be\nthe best of the best, its still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe\nproud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so\nmuch good work thats come before it and while its sad to say goodbye to this particular era, its exciting to see what\nlays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5",

The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated\ninto something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty,\nthe pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time\nto cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that\nevery trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a\nwhirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will\nhave many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful. The effects, the music, the story, the emotions. Its\nhonestly a hell of a ride.Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears.",

    "reviewTitle": "Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics. Brilliant, and worth every minute youve invested in the MCU since 2008.",
    "reviewBody": "THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films,\nit has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the\nfranchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with\nheart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. Thats no small feat, and its even more remarkable that\na movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesnt fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy\nscript or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCUs crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers,\ntheir stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity\nWar, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxys population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing\nwitness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with\nthe crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into\ndarkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd)\nreturns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...THE GREAT:\nEndgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a\ndecade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers.\nTony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures,\nwhile Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save\ntheir families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the films comic relief,\nbut both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to\njuggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors\nAnthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels\nvirtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the\nstaggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved\ncharacters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in\nstitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers genius\nand their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is\nemphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you\nunderstand what the heck is going on if you havent watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few\nlogical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from\nthe wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers\n(Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt\ntribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it\nincludes Stan Lees final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce\nthe interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie\nthat started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around\nthe character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of\nMarvel Comics more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencers run on Captain America: Steve\nRogers.)CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCUs core strengths, with Oscar\nwinners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting\nstrategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but\nmanage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all.\nHemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm\nand intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and\nRenner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces.\nEvans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a\nman whos - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films\nbelongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully\nconveys every shade and layer of his characters hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have\nnever needed that Tony Stark has a heart.RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can\npossibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine\nemotion. Its the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and its worth every minute youve\ninvested in the MCU since 2008.",

Yes, theres a measure of predictability; but theres also plenty of surprises - a mix of both, really,\nwhich feels just about right.My feelings a few hours after seeing Endgame are as follows: Sad, a little depressed that\nsome things will never be the same going forward. I know all good earthly things have an end - sometimes its a little\ndifficult to accept. In a way, the good ol days are now officially \"old\". On the flip side of the coin, Im a little\nexuberant about the possibilities opened up, the new concepts explored, and probably more than anything, the completely\nperfect fanfare that had the folks at my cinema cheering and applauding at every turn. In other words, Im experiencing\nmixed emotions. Decipher my very cryptic notes as you will... but see Endgame for yourself. Its hardly something to be\nmissed. And its hardly something to be forgotten.Some people move on. But not us.Not us.",

This\nfilm is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally\ngravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first\nhour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these\nsurviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun\nhijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all\npretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story\npoint of view bar some small missteps here and there.",

Theres just so much in it, that I cant\neven write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for\nseveral of the characters weve watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but its\nhard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant.\nIt is the grande finale.",

It delivers on all fronts!\nThere were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and\nHawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who\nfound a peaceful way to co-exist.\nThere were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who\nactually didnt have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.\nThey tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all\nthe glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a\nforgettable performance.\nThere are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots.\nAlthough it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a\nvery good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing.

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers: Endgame sticks the landing",
    "reviewBody": "Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they wont give anything major away. Its amazing for a huge\nmovie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that theyre overtly borrowing from. The minor\ncharacters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly\nentertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in\ntheir previous MCU films and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. Its no spoiler\nto say that hes in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the\nAvengers front gate. Its Paul Rudds wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really\nassist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. Its brilliantly\npaced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and\nthen victory, take those ingredients, shake well and youve got a loose description of some average superhero films.If\nAvengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for\nany ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way wouldve\ncheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots\nof humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What were left with is a 10 year opus that\nspans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many\nMCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the\nfans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to\ngrow on.Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then theyll be OK with this. The film\nhas fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there\nisnt any one instance thats as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained\naction sequences that might test those 8 years old who havent seen an MCU movie before.",

    "reviewTitle": "when over the top is just right",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled \"Avengers: Infinity War Part 2\", we get the\nmuch-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3.\nRegardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this\nfinale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos?\nWhat role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play?\nWill those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life?\nWill Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space?\nWho will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, its colossal/humongous/monumental ...\nwhatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered\nquite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher\nMarkus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU\nentries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines,\nvisually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, its difficult to imagine\na more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I dont offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffics\nclassic \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread\nprovided by Infinity War, we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than\nwhat weve come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America,\nThor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust\nme when I say, youve never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans 10th film as Captain\nAmerica, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It\nmakes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and\nspeculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that\nworks, but thats the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at\nthe expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas\narea critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few\nsniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional\nbeginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters weve gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should\nknow just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor\nones. Its quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the\nPepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a\nwomens movement moment that seems to be Marvels \"we hear you\" statement. Much of what we see is \"inevitable\", but as\nthe Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when over-the-top is\njust right.",

Very good.Q: Did it feel like 3 hours?\nA: No... even though it was fairly leisurely paced for about the first hour or so, I never felt bored or restless.Q: Did\nit meet expectations?\nA: More or less- and they were high to begin with.Q: How necessary is it to watch the previous Marvel movies before this\none?\nA: Very. This has the most call-backs to the previous MCU movies out of any so far, which is fitting given that its an\n\"ending\" of sorts to the previous 20 or so movies.Q: Did you cry?\nA: No, but Im jaded and wouldnt be surprised if other people did.Q: Did you laugh?\nA: Yeah it was pretty funny, without sacrificing the more serious stuff. Similar to how the humour was handled in\nInfinity War.Q: Speaking of Infinity War, was it better than Endgame?\nA: I dunno, hard to say right now. Theyre both about on the same level for me.Q: How was the Stan Lee cameo?\nA: A bit rubbish to be honest, especially if this is to be his last.Q: You gonna keep watching these Marvel movies after\nthis one?\nA: Probably. If this is the last one I ever saw I think I could live with that. But if there are still interesting\nstories to tell and talented filmmakers who want to make them, then Ill be there.",

    "reviewTitle": "Most definitely the most anticipated film of the year.",
    "reviewBody": "Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with\neye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The\npromotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore Ill keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun.\nAfter the events of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more.\nThats all Ill say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters.\nUnlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for\nthese characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark\nRuffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and\nsurprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and\ncomradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen\ntalking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to\nthe films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as\nbrutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were\ntwo that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I havent seen\nCaptain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didnt do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a\nterrific actress) didnt have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity\nWar, Brolins Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story\nwas dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos movie. But if Im supposed to judge Endgame as a film on\nits own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldnt be overly analysed aside.\nAvengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I dont know how\nthey can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the\nMCU and superhero films in general.",

    "reviewBody": "This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest Ill go in terms of talking\nabout what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt,\nand thats performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know\nthese characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see\nthese characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldnt imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big\nscreen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with\nnot much knowledge about Marvel wouldnt make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of\nunderstanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must\nacknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours\ncompletely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22\nmovies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come\nto, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that Ive ever seen. Make sure not to miss a\nsingle minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right\nchoices, bringing an emotional tone weve never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny\nproblems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to\nthe point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just dont land, especially in one scene at\nthe very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didnt really\nmatter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesnt feel that long whatsoever,\nmaybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers:\nEndgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America:\nCivil War right below it. There are many theories online, and Im aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all\nof them arent even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and\nI cant wait to see whats in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, theres no after credits, it doesnt matter how long you\nstay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene.",

They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening\nnight and couldnt wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched\nalmost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasnt blown away. The problem for me was\nthat while I was enjoying the movie, I couldnt help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden\nI wasnt that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other\nMarvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I dont know whether\nthey had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial\nthat were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting.\nThere were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart\nand lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have\nalready had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale)\nshould be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been\nfollowing the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has\nbeen wasted in this way.",

Tom Hanks plays the intellectually challenged Gump and picked up his\nsecond consecutive Oscar for his over the top portrayal. A spectacular job considering the Academy do not normally fall\nfor the same ploys as the movie going public. Even more spectacular when you consider that Morgan Freeman was nominated\nfor The Shawshank Redemption. Gump was the Best Film winner as well, even though Pulp Fiction AND The Shawshank\nRedemption were nominated. I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years or Dazed and Confused,\nnice but nothing special. Its little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how\nit affected one man, namely Mr Gump. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gumps Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field\nis well cast as Gumps mother, beyond that there is not much to redeem Gump, the effects are very nicely added if\nnothing new and the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers. For the most part its too\nmushy, way too sentimental and just not much above mediocre. In years to come the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction\nwill be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump.",

But then again, not too many films can bring out human emotions this film does.",

Tow the line,\ndo as youre told, dont question  war, injustice, corruption, exploitation etc and America will reward you. Remember,\nif you do want to say anything of worth, make sure the microphone isnt working. 2) Question authority and you will die\nof AIDS (but lets not mention Homo***uality)All in all a propaganda movie mourning the passing of the 1950s Anglo-White\nMiddle Class America whose myth died with Eisenhower. \"Life is Like a Box of Chocolates\"? No I dont think it is really\nis it?. And as for one reviewer comparing it to Schindlers List - you should be ashamed of yourself. I wonder how\nForrest would have danced around the Holocaust?

Its just simple, in a\nkind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what\ndo I know?, but Ive been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues.

The nation\nlaughed and cried along with Forrest throughout the course of the movie and through pure visceral emotion, resulted in\nAcademy Awards out the wazoo.  If this movie evoked any kind of response out of me, I might say it made me cry... out of\npure boredom.  I was disappointed in the ridiculousness of \"Forrest Gump\", a lot of the reason being because I hold Tom\nHanks in such high regard and never once thought that he would be one to promote the patronizing American Dream theory.\nIt completely blows my mind that this movie received so many awards and so much hype when it is utterly unbelievable and\nabsolutely unrealistic. The braces bursting from Forrests legs, his unintentional football scholarship to college, his\nmeeting the president (and might I add his only words to Mr. Kennedy were \"I have to go pee\"), his millions earned\nthrough ping-pong, his (how pathetic) running across America four times for \"no reason at all\", his \"inventing\" the\nhappy face symbol by wiping his face on a towel... all this is just incredibly... stupid, if I may be so blunt.  The\nmovie attempts to show that to succeed in life, one does not need to be overly intelligent, all one needs is a lot of\nheart.  Very touching, but dense all the same and the movie is so far out that viewers only see it as entertainment and\nwill not derive motivation to make something of themselves.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job and is convincing as a\nmentally-challenged man, but the movie as a whole, the supposed \"story-line\" and non-existent plot are pathetic and hold\nno ground.  \"Forrest Gump\" deserved no awards in my opinion.",

Its about a simpleton who knows what\nlove, loyalty, family, and friendship are, and their importance in life. Its about those around him who come to realize\nthat perhaps the simpleton has more of a clue as to what is TRULY important in life than they do.Hanks performance is\nexcellent, as is Robin Wrights and Gary Sinises.

    "reviewBody": "Today I watched the original version for the first time, not having seen the German-dubbed version for some time. And I\nwas really amazed how I couldnt hold back my tears. This movie is a masterpiece! I remembered that I had also cried the\nprevious times I had watched that movie. But I wasnt really driven to tears by any movie during the last months and so\nI thought I might have grown kind of too tough to be really touched. And then I watched Forrest Gump again and at least\nfive times a stream of water broke off in my eyes. Scenes like Jennys return, Forrest naming his shrimps-boat \"Jenny\",\nthe last conversation with his mother or the final scene by Jennys grave - oh, and when he meets his son... Oh boy! I\neven started to cry before I saw these scenes because I already knew what happens and that sole expectation was enough\nto make me cry. I havent experienced so MUCH and so TRUE and so INEVITABLE emotion in a movie for a very long time. I\nwould go on enumerating all the scenes where I cried, because I love Forrests pure love for Jenny so much, I love his\nrelationship with his mother, I love his loyalty against Bubba and I love his friendship with Lieutenant Dan... I just\nlove the movie!But of course a really good movie as it is, is not only built on water. Its also a very funny movie. You\nwont laugh half as loud as you will during movies like \"The Naked Gun\"(if you like them), but there is no less humour.\nThe appearance of icons like JFK, Elvis and John Lennon and the - more or less honest - intention to chronicle American\nhistory from the 1950s to the 1980s belong to this humour. All these events are made ridiculous and dealt with as though\nthey were rather unimportant, but they also make up the movie. Things look less disturbing, when you see them through\nthe eyes of Forrest Gump! He doesnt understand whats going on and doesnt take it seriously. But would you hate him\ntherefore? No. Do you think youd have to pity him? No.All the characters are fantastic. Forrest, the moron, who is so\nwonderfully naive that he would deserve and obtain all the happiness of the world. The proud and unconventional mother,\nmisguided but through and through good-hearted Jenny, dedicatedly silly-stuff-talking Bubba and especially Lieutenant\nDan, who is such an interesting and wonderfully created character. Gary Sinise plays him as such a jerk in terms, but\nalways likeable and understandable. All other actors are no less fantastic, but I dont want to extend this to far. My\nrating, of course, is a clear 10!",

    "reviewTitle": "Forrest Gump: The kind of Genius we REALLY need!",
    "reviewBody": "First of all, Forrest Gump was an excellent film.  The emotions was real, the action was real, the characters were real,\nand plausible, some coincidences were extreme, but did nothing to hurt the movie.People seem to be angered at the fact\nthat the character of Forrest Gump attains so much success, let alone his lack of \"intelligence.\"  I believe this is the\npoint that the author tried to make.  Forrest Gump may have had a childish, naive common sense, but he succeeded anyway,\nand with flying colours.  His innocence kept him from being tempted by greed, thus hurting himself and others. Honestly,\nif there were more Forrest Gumps  around, the world would be a better place (dont mean to sound sentimental).All the\ncharacters are used well to convey the image of the time.  Forrests mother, and old-fashioned, good-hearted lady is\ntypical of the time.  Jenny, falling into a drug crazed orgy during the seventies, pays for it by contracting AIDs a\nplausible fate for her actions.  Lieutenant Dan, a typical war vet, whom sees no reason for life without the ability to\nbe normal shows us how to respect life in its fullest.  Bubba, the sentiment character who is killed in battle at\nForrests side, leads to further events in the story well.The theme of success, happiness and awe of the world is well\nportrayed in the \"running\" scene where Forrest runs across america twofold.And possibly the most subtle, yet important\ntheme of running away, is used with excellence.  From \"Run Forrest, Run\" to the scene with Forrest carrying Bubba from\nbattle, to the football antics, and finally the \"Run across america\" scenes are genius.   Forrest was always a good\nrunner, running away from his fears, running away from himself and running away from the truth. The one thing he did not\nrun away from was Jenny, in fact he was running to Jenny. This emotional love-story may be a little \"storybook\" but it\nshows the power of love in everyone, even the handicapped.This film was excellent, I dont see how anyone could give it\nanything under 7/10 stars.I personally give it 9/10.",

And, honestly, I think that the\nless subtle the critics are, the more hurt is their U.S. patriotism. First, If you wonder if something is realistic\nhere, you should stop watching movies. One good thing about FG is, that it isnt supposed to be realistic, though it\nalmost convinces you that it is, but it is far too overdone to be so. It is meant to be a fable, like Benignis \"La vita\ne bella\".\"Stupid is as stupid does\" is to my mind the key word throughout the movie. Forrest Gump stumbles through world\nhistory (though only the United States are shown, but Hollywood usually supposes them to be the world so the movie has\nto be seen more in general than its usual critics do) and what he sees makes only sense to a dim-whitted who doesnt\nlet himself get stirred by events: Politicians are shot at(though no one elects better ones), Leutenants seek death in\nbattle, \"running as fast as the wind\" is regarded as sufficient to get a collegue-degree and somebody who wants to\nchange the world ends up in a terrible mess, having somehow missed the point. So we all do stupid often enough, society\ndoes and even America does like the rest of the world. Just Forrest doesnt.(Except towards Jenny, but thats a\ncompletely different thing, thats love.)He has only an IQ of 75 but he is the only one who behaves in a way we would\nlike to expect from everyone (though we surely dont want them to talk like that). He has nothing to base his actions\nupon than his common sense and that shows us how far weve come apart from our ideal of rational behaviour.In the end\none word to those who hated the film for Jennys death of AIDS which they regarded as punishment,decreed by an\nreactionary movie: to my mind, Jennys death is not ideology, its tragedy, though it also conveys the basic idea of the\nmovie. We wont get a better world by revolutions or drugs, we only achieve it if more people would do like Forrest,\neven when they have a higher IQ.",

    "reviewBody": "While this film has good points which others have already mentioned, I wanted to point out some points that really\nirritated me.The #1 thing is that this film would shed tears for the shooting of George Wallace, an opportunistic\npolitician who curried racist favour for his own cheap political gain, yet have NOT ONE mention of Martin Luther King in\nany way, shape or form.  This was even though he was working in Alabama at the same time when Forrest was growing up and\nit would be certainly more believable for Forrest to meet King than 90% percent of the celebrities he meets in his life.\nIm not asking him to meet Malcolm X, considering he was working in New York at the time.  Yet, King is ignored as if he\ndidnt exist.Second, the cross country marathon screams of being tacked on.  I fail to see any humour in it and my eyes\nrolled how the media completely ignores in their reports that this \"mystery marathonner\" is an All American football\nplayer, a Congressional Medal of Honour recipient, a ping pong company spokesman and a millionaire owner of a fishing\nfleet.  You would figure this would make a lot of hay for any reporter writing this up about a man who can do all this\nand have a IQ of less than 75.",

    "reviewTitle": "If this isnt a 10/10 movie I have not seen one!!!",
    "reviewBody": "Some users view this movie as inferior to The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) which was released the same year. Personally, I\nsee that both Forrest Gump (FG) and TSR as the same standard of excellence. Both movies shows contrasting aspects of\nhope and how to adjust to injustices in the outside world. What made FG a classic and probably gave it the best picture\nOscar was not only the special effects throughout the movie, or the brilliant appropriate use of music fitting the era,\nbut the incredible acting and plot device. When I first saw FG I thought it was a good family comedy with immense\namounts of surrealism. However after repeat viewing I realised that FG had one of the most thought provoking scripts\never committed to film. There are so many aspects of the storyline that has never left me ever since I saw the movie\nalmost five years ago. Just like Life is Beautiful there is the external and internal images and story in this picture.\nThe external is a family comedy that will make you laugh as many things seem so outrageous. However internally, FG is a\nmovie about drug addiction, child sexual abuse, a true sacrificial love story with one way traffic, how a person can\ncope with disability without committing suicide, the nature of God when something terrible happens to you, prostitution\nand so much more besides. Tell me one other movie that can handle these subjects and still make you laugh throughout\nwhile telling you important moral lessons?Unlike other so called romance movies like Titanic, FG was not based on lust\nrather an understanding and fidelity of other persons characters. If Forrest Gump is a bit dumb he makes up for it with\nhis saint like character. What made this movie tragic is the long time span in which Forrest is in love with his girl\nand would do almost anything for her and yet she disrespects him because he is mentally disabled, he is not normal.\nYet the people Jenny hangs around with are spiritually and morally abnormal. If people cant relate to this maybe it\nis beyond their understanding and comprehension as they have never been in that position.Forrest may not be able to\nverbalise the meaning of love, but his actions put normal people to shame and some. Where else in a modern film do you\nsee the hero being rejected by a gril or even genuinely wanting to get married, only in the old classics I suppose!!\nForrest always has the hope of a better future, he teaches the audience that you should always have an aim to look\nforward to and that will help to keep you sane under misfortune, even if its simply running down the road to owning a\nbusiness. In addition, the movie shows that no matter what your disability you can still make a contribution to society\nand other peoples lives. If this is not a powerful message I have never seen or heard one. Forrest knows that Jenny is\nthe only girl he has got a chance with to be his wife, which makes the story even sadder as we see Jenny living a life\non the edge. Even at the ending we are unsure whether Forrest is really looking after his son, but as long it is Jennys\nand she is his,  he does not mind. Maybe this is a blind type of love, but he also loves Jenny like a biblical prodigal\nsister and he does not realise that he may have AIDS too. However FG gives hope to many millions of people around the\nworld who are disabled and feel socially excluded in society. As the years roll by I still think about this movie which\nshows aspects of life which are heart wretchingly profound if you look beyond the external window. If this isnt a 10/10\nmovie I have not seen one.",

    "reviewTitle": "The greatest movie ever made - and why it won the Oscars!!!",
    "reviewBody": "A number of users have mentioned that The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) should have won the best picture Oscar over Forrest\nGump (FG). This type of criticism is unjustified when you realise the various reason why FG actually won the Oscars!!!\n1) The title Forrest Gump is a bit misleading as the movie is not really about FG as it first seems for the average\nviewer, rather it is about us the audience who are supposed to be normal but we act in real life even worse than FG. 2)\nFG is laughing at us as we laugh at him. We see him as abnormal, but when Forrest tries to understand us he finds out\nthat normal people cause so much pain in the world towards other people. This is clearly shown with the short clips of\npolitical and social history throughout the movie which the viewing audience in the cinema failed to recognise. This\nhelps to prove FG case against normal people. 3) The movie can be interpreted in so many different ways that every time\na viewer watches it they get a different version of what Forrest sees and understands and what it means for human nature\nas a whole. Only Forrest seems normal in the movie, while others are killing pop stars and important people in society.\nForrest cant understand why normal people do this, as for me personally I agree with Forrest on this issue. 4) While\nForrest is telling his story of events in his life, many of the viewing audience thought it was literally happening, but\nbecause some of the events described are surreal in its feel many people thought the movie was silly. Yet it was the\nviewers who were silly as they see things through Forrests eyes not their own. Equally the viewer misses many of the\nimportant aspects of the movies message because they fail to go into Forrests world and explore.Misinterpretation that\nthe viewer makes: 1) The running scene though at first seeming stupid is in fact one of the most thought provoking\nscenes ever in the history of movie making, but the average viewer does not realise this, because he/she cannot think\nbroadly. This scene shows that normal people are stupid to follow people in the media as icons thinking they are clever\npeople because they seem to be doing something special. What Forrest shows is that famous people are just as brainy as\nevery else. But we normal people worship politicians in vain and others stars to sort out our world problems. 2) When\nForrest is speaking at a rally against Vietnam, again people in real life follow anybody who has a big mouth without\nreally understanding what they are saying - so profound as well as funny. 3) Jenny only realises that Forrest is the\nright person for her when it is too late, you should not judge on appearances, rather the character.The Movie also shows\nhow normal people bully others, rape and child abuse children, start wars, use people and discriminate others. Forrest\ndoes not do any of these things, yet we as the viewer call him abnormal. For me, this is the most innovative movie I\nhave ever seen as it has duped the world to think it is about Forrest rather than themselves.",

Robert Zemeckis has the power to exhaust me, whether its my emotions (\"Contact\", this film), my\nvisual cortex (\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"Contact\"), or my funny bone (\"Used Cars\").  His screenplay is responsible for\nanything positive that came out of Steven Spielbergs 1979 flop \"1941\", (except for that astonishing dance sequence).\nHere he tops his past films and screenplays and has not done quite as good since then.Ill be honest:  sentimentality\nhas its proper place and time, and must be done right.  This film has it.  I laughed and cried, and was struck dumb with\nawe.Its six Oscars meant that a few better films, performers, and technicians were robbed blind, but lets be real,\nfolks:  theyre Academy Awards.  Its a popularity contest, and as long as we see it for what it is, we can just sit\nback and enjoy them.  \"Forrest Gump\" wouldnt get any prizes from me, for the simple reason that any category would be\nwon by another film.

    "reviewTitle": "Tom Hanks makes it work",
    "reviewBody": "Some of its critics say that \"Forrest Gump\" is little more than a right wing fable whose message is \"Vote Republican.\"\nYes, Forrest is the embodiment of \"traditional values,\" a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother, does what hes\ntold, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while\nJenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed:\nIn the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in\nVietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast\nliving, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing\npropagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what youre told, never talk back, and youll be\nsuccessful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life\nthat the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of\ngoodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus,\nForrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives\nall of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For\nJenny, however, it was too late.  Once she settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with\nher.Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They maintain that \"Forrest Gump\" is simply a\nfable promoting such tried and true values as honoring your parents and your God.  Its the story of innocence\nuncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No matter how evil the times, goodness can prevail.I\nmust say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do the arguments of those who champion the film.  It\nis with the latter group that I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since James Stewart\nhas an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency. Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help\nyou overlook the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" with John\nLennon failed to convince).  I think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" but of\nall the people who took home Oscars for \"Forrest Gump,\" no one earned theirs more than Hanks.  I cant imagine another\nactor (a living one, anyway) taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he did.",

    "reviewBody": "A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is\nfrankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allens \"Zelig\", the title character involves\nhimself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of\nthe 60s and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: \"S**t happens\". Why create a hero\nwho celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyones guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence\nquotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely\nobjective level,  \"Forrest Gump\" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very\nconspicuous \"homage\") from such masterpieces as \"Midnight Cowboy\", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible\nclimax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks\ngets into even more of his \"stupid\" adventures.",

I think the film\nadaptation is better than the book itself and the deep symbolism play an important role in that. The rcreation of five\ndecades in American History is truly a feat to be hailed. And the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. One thing\nthat strikes me as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. Such as the filming of Bubbas ansectors and\nLt. Dans history of ansestors dying in wars. Even the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. These quick\nflashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and werent even totally necessary to film, but they did anyway. That\ngives this movie an A for effort in my book.",

And, if you want to get picky about it, its the only big blockbuster to make it onto the\nIMDB Top 250 in the past ten years, with the exception of \"Terminator 2\".  That just goes to show that it is not \"hype\nover content\".  Many people were turned off by the idea of a stupid person as the all-encompassing Everyman, but these\nwere the same people who left the movie theater dry-eyed and continued on their very way, looking for advice from\nMadison Avenue, dumping their oh-so-liberal views on whoever would be genial enough to listen, and oh yes,\ncondescendingly talking down to the local village idiot and then making fun of him behind his back.  Believe me, I have\nknown people in my time described as \"village idiots\", and the personality with which Tom Hanks imbues Gumps character\nis dead-on accurate.  The film touched me in so many ways that my throat still lumps up every time the feather ascends\nto the sky with Alan Silvestris BEAUTIFUL music playing in the background.  Zemeckis should be proud of himself for\nthis one, which I think will go down as his masterpiece (and thats saying something from the man who made \"Back to the\nFuture\" and \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\").  Forrest Gump may have been slow, but he was anything but a simpleton...those\nwho denounce people like him and their naive worldview just envy the fact that their lives are built around a shimmering\nideal brighter than all of the sexcapades and trivial pettiness of normality.  Oh yes, and for the person who commented\non this film as \"The worst Best Picture Oscar winner of the 90s\"...obviously you havent seen \"Shakespeare in Love\".",

The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award of the six Gump won).The story of a\nsimpleton floating through life doesnt appeal to me. There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to\nwant to create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and ground it solidly in realism, which just\ndoesnt work.I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing.

    "reviewBody": "\"Forrest Gump\" is exactly the kind of film that has suffered from too much praise. As someone who genuinely loves this\nfilm, I am dumbfounded by those who hate it. But time after time, when a film receives high praise from a great number\nof people, it leaves high expectations for those who havent seen it. The result is often disappointment.Some people\nobject to its unrealistic approach. Suggesting that the involvement of Forrest in some of Americas pivotal moments in\nhistory is not only ridiculous but misleading. Another argument Ive heard is the fact that a mentally handicapped\nindividual could never attain the levels of success that Forrest does. Theyve missed out on a truly charming, endearing\nfairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a simple one at that. And the dialogue is so\ninherently quotable, as the message behind it is so straightforward. \"Stupid is as stupid does\".Forrest is a purely\ninnocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no fault found in him. Its the rest of the world that is realistic,\nimpure, and flawed. And so, when Forrest hurts, we cant help but hurt for him, when he is successful, we cant help but\nbe happy for him and when his heart breaks, ours breaks also.I cant tell if its the music, the cinematography or the\nacting, but the scene where young Forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the bullies on bicycles, gets me every\ntime. Every single time. Ive watched this film more times than I care to count, as I feel as though I should be\nwatching something Ive never seen before. But this film just makes me feel good, and Ill no doubt watch it again.Now\nyou see, I cant help but praise this film, and in a way Im probably ruining it for someone else. My sister blames me\nfor ruining it for her. Its not easy to forget what everyones said, and the awards it has won. But if you havent seen\nit already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and open your mind to a very charming film.",

This movie also shows that even though Forrest was slow, he\nhad a lot of love in his heart. He wasnt intelligent, but he knew what love was.What Tom Hanks did in this movie is\nincredible. He made up a character that so unbelievable but is so realistic. He did an extraordinary acting job, and\nthat is why I think hes the best actor.I think the best part of the movie is when Forrest stands next to Jennys grave,\nand recites that speech. That part was wonderful. Especially when he says \"And our son, Forrest...Hes just so smart\nJenny. We go fishing together, we run together...\" It was great!",

The dangerous thing about this movie\nis its sweeping generalizations and stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American history.\nBecause the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to pull so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their\nrevisionist version of the past few decades with little objection from the viewer.Yes, its just a movie, but images\nlike these shape the way people think. The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers, for\nexample, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie.

    "reviewBody": "There are certain films that people should just enjoy.  Forrest Gump is one of them.  It makes you feel good.  It makes\nyou feel happy and it makes you appreciate what excellent film making is all about.  Simply put, this movie is pretty\nmuch flawless and it is a movie for the ages.Pulp Fiction was deserving of best picture and so was Shawshank Redemption,\nbut only one of these fine three films could have won that year.  It is like watching the two best hockey teams playing\nin the Stanley Cup Finals.  It is the seventh game and we are now in triple overtime and the score is tied at 2.  One\nteam will win the cup, and not necessarily because they are better than the other, but because someone has to win.  That\nwas the case in 1994. I loved Pulp, and I loved Shawshank, but I loved Gump too and when it won I cheered out loud.\nGood for Robert Zemekis.What is so great about Forrest Gump is that it makes life a little more pure, a little more\ninnocent.  Forrest never really quite understands what is going on around him and for that reason he lives life in the\ndark in some ways but in other ways, he sees so much more light than the rest of us. And his antics and the way he lives\nthat life is an inspiration to the rest of us, or at least it should be.  And how can you not like the guy.  Is there a\nmore likable character in the history of cinema?  I doubt it!Robert Zemekis took me completely by storm when I first saw\nthis film. Back To The Future was a great film and he has always shown that he has a propensity for box office gold, but\nto make a picture that was not only phenomenally successful at the box office but is this sweet and fun and heart\nwarming, was not what I expected from him.  Then again, he is a Spielberg cronie, so that must mean something.Zemekis is\none of the strengths of this film, but the tour de force is really Hanks.  His adaptation of the character is\nremarkable.  He is ever so convincing and even though his work in Philedelphia was completely Oscar worthy, this is even\na step above that.  I love him here and I will see anything that he is in from here on out.I love movies.  I love what\nthey do to me.  I love that they can make me feel a plethora of emotions.  Even when I despise a film, I can still look\nback and say that if anything it made me feel something.  But Forrest Gump is a microcosm of why I like movies.  My\nworld is little better after I watch this movie and for that I am so glad that this film was made.  And for the people\nthat cant enjoy this movie, I certainly hope that in the years to come you can.  Because you just dont know what\nyoure missing.",

    "reviewBody": "In the early 90s Michael Medved wrote a book urging Hollywood to eschew sex and violence and make films that extolled\nthe virtues of America, family, religion, apple pie, Thanksgiving, home-baked cookies blah blah blah. He was arguing\nfrom a moral (read conventional Western family-oriented standpoint) but his argument also had a bearing on the\nbottom line. He reckoned that more nice films would encourage more people back into the cinemas.Forrest Gump would\nappear to be the realisation of Medveds dream, to the extent that the movie also praises the virtue he left off the\nlist, namely abject stupidity. Because thats what MM and his cronies really want, isnt it? Movies that dont\nchallenge, dont irritate, dont ask awkward questions. Movies with no toilets (see Pleasantville), movies that operate\non the assumption that a fortune-cookie-spouting dullard who loves his mom is some kind of embodiment of the American\ndream.Wake up, America. You managed to elect one Hollywood simpleton with a tenuous acquaintance to reality. Now you\nmake movies about them. In the words of the greatest American philosopher, DOH!This is a dumb movie, made by clever,\ncynical people, for other people who want to feel all warm and fuzzy and not worry about the fact that they lost all\nform of intellectual discrimination the day they took out that subscription to Readers Digest.

ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably\n`Quiz Show).  Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump.  I took this as a deep personal affront.  I took every\nundeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront.  It was a\nstanding insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump was just too stupid to succeed for very long.  Ah, well.  Life imitates\nart.Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as\na virtue.  Gump is as innocent as they come and were clearly meant to think that this is a good thing.  The trouble is\nthat Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply.  He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam\nWar: he gives the appearance of courage only because hes too dumb to work out whats going on.  (If only a bomb had\nlanded on his foot.  It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)The\nfilm is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such\nappeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldnt want to spend five minutes\nwith.`Forrest Gump is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.",

    "reviewTitle": "Shallow, frequently offensive movie somewhat redeemed by Hanks and Sinise",
    "reviewBody": "FORREST GUMP is a vaguely picaresque story of a mentally retarded but good-hearted fellow who grows up during the 1960s\nand 1970s, serving in the Vietnam conflict, running a shrimping trawler, and pursuing a very unlovable childhood\nsweetheart.  He has no control over his life, but is not smart enough to realize it or care.  Gary Sinise co-stars as\nLt. Dan Taylor, Gumps ex-C.O. who follows him around after the war like an albatross hung around his neck.Its been\nfive years since I saw this movie, but I still remember how it annoyed me, chiefly by appealing to the basest, most\njaded parts of the viewers personalities.  The worst instance was when Forrest Gump tells the audience that his\nsweetheart Jennys father loves her a lot, always hugging and kissing her.  In my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker\nrippled through the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement that Jennys father is\nsexually abusing her, and Zemeckis later confirms this leap to a sick conclusion.  It is a truly sad commentary both on\nthe entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very concept of fatherhood today is so\ndisrespected that for a father to hug and kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse.Jennys character\nis so despicable that Gumps love for her is inexplicable. Perhaps it is intended as an example of really\n\"unconditional\" love, and shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who clings to an abusive\nhusband no matter what he does to her.  Her character hits rock bottom when, having abandoned Gump like a used-up tissue\nand taken his child from him without even informing him, Jenny refuses even to apologize to him because she was \"messed\nup.\"  Gump swallows this excuse with stomach-turning ease.Now I dont want to launch into some Pat-Robertson-like tirade\non the decline of American morality.  American morality is better today than in the past in many ways.  Racial hatred\nhas gone from being an accepted norm to being absolutely intolerable.  Rape is blamed on the victim less frequently than\nin bygone days.  Sexual double standards are being abandoned. Religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the\nupswing.  But in some other ways, American morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, \"I was messed up,\" is perhaps\nthe best example.  Every kind of barbarism, from Jennys cruel and heartless manipulation of Gump up to and including\ncold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase \"I was messed up,\" followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoers\nmisfortunes.  FORREST GUMP wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers moral thought.  Im not\nbuying into it.  Being \"messed up\" may excuse viciousness against the person who messed you up; it should never be\nallowed to justify hurting innocent people.The movies exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is also\ntasteless and vulgar (and yes, I will shamefacedly admit, I laughed at some of this exploitation).  I may not want a\nmental deficient like Gump for an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic decency and courtesy,\nwhich this movie doesnt; (i.e. where Gump, shaking Richard Nixons hand, says \"I gotta pee.\"  This is funny?).The\nmitigating, if not the saving, virtue of FORREST GUMP is the acting. Tom Hanks rendition of a speech impediment might\nnot fool the parent of a mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly convinced me and the average\nmoviegoer.  Hanks generates the innocence and pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my\nnerves a few times, it was bearable.  Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor is absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and\ncynicism from every pore.I also give FORREST GUMP some grudging praise for being one of the few movies to use the\nwonders of modern digital special effects to actually drive the plot, rather than distract from it.  TITANIC and\nJURASSIC PARK also broke some ground, but for the most part I think that most directors lack the imagination to get the\nmost out of the potential of modern special effects.  Zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly than\nmost directors have.I didnt really hate FORREST GUMP.  It obviously wants to be loved so much that hating it would be\nlike kicking an annoying puppy.  But its morally obtuse, shallow and vulgar.  The laughs are guilty laughs, and the\nphilosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that God does indeed look after fools.Rating: ** out of ****.",

    "reviewBody": "The best thing in this movie is Gary Sinise. He growls, smirks, and spits his way through a terrific performance before\nhis character is converted to Forrests religion. Other than that, theres not much meat in this movie. I thought Hanks\nwas pretty good as Gump, but its not a role that you can screw up too badly because theres very little character to\nslip into.\nThe biggest problem with it is the artificial, plastic directing job, something that other Zamekis productions suffer\nfrom also. The sequence of dying Lt. Dan ancestors is particularly egregious - its supposed to be funny, I think, but\ndoesnt quite make it. Im also at a loss to explain why we needed the Gump within a Gump voiceover narration. It only\nadds to the syrupy tone with the kind of pseudo-humor you see in many TV commercials. This story could have told itself\nquite well without this and similar directorial tricks.I was a little bit bothered by the right-wing sensibilities\npresent, but not all that much. Im used to the co-opting of counter-culture product to prove alternate ideals (like the\nidea behind John Lennons \"Imagine\"). Using a false history as a dramatic device is OK with me, just do something\ninteresting with it. Hollywood has a tendency to de-legitimize creativity as merely the accident of situation. Zamekis\nhas done this before in Back to the Future, where Chuck Berry supposedly gets his inspiration for \"Johnny B. Good\" from\none performance (instead of years of hard work). I hate it when this is used for a joke - and not a very good one,\nusually. Just like many things in this movie, its pandering to the nostalgia of the audience. Similar things are done\nto Bear Bryant. But I digress.The best scene in the movie is when Hanks sees Sinise at the dock and runs into the water\nto greet him. It sums up both characters beautifully. And despite (or maybe because of) the heavy borrowing from other\nmovies, other good scenes are the barroom scene with Hanks and Sinise, the orgasm scene, and the initial meeting of\nHanks and his Drill Sergeant. I mention these because they dont typify the piled-on heavy sentiment that the rest of\nthe movie employs.",

    "reviewBody": "The first time I saw Forrest Gump, I loved it. On the second time around, I saw how terrible it actually is. There is\nnot as much a plot as an idea. Its like watching \"Look whos talking\", where the writers thought that simply having a\nbaby talk was plot enough to fill a hour and a half.You all know the premise of this movie. The life of a retarded man\nin 20th century America. He does a lot of unusual things, which all turn out ok and trigger key historical events. This\nis funny. Then the writers see that two hours have passed, and have to conjure an ending. They kill off Forrests wife\nand have Forrest give a tearjerking speech like only Tom Hanks can. This is uplifting. There. Now go home and feel\ngood.Some of my friends saw the film as plain all-american propaganda. In my opinion however, the film doesnt really\ntake itself seriously enough to just be a vehicle for the American dream. In fact, Forrest Gump could have been a biting\nsatire. As the audience is clearly supposed to laugh at Forrests improbable success, the film could be seen as a\nparody. Mostly all the humour comes from the fact that the audience knows that the events are the exact opposite of what\nwould happen in reality. The filmmakers could even have argued that recent history is so insane, that the events could\nas well have been caused by someone like Mr. Gump. The movie, however, doesnt have the guts to have lean to the right\nor left. Forrests pivotal role in history is treated as a mere light-hearted gimmick, omitting all the possibilities\nfor actual commentary.The film tries to have it both ways in many other scenes as well. Apparently its not PC to bully\nForrest, but on the other hand the audience is supposed to laugh at his antics. Forrest as both a war hero and a peace\nadvocate exemplifies this problem. This isnt being ironic, impartial or open to interpretation. Especially concerning\nthe Vietnam war, the writers have obviously not wanted to offend anyone, now matter how derivative it will look. In the\nend, it only comes off as having nothing to say.",

The older folks, because they\nlived through it as adults; baby bloomers because they lived through it as young adults; even the kids in my\nneighborhood will scream: \" run,  Forrest, run.\" Every time they see someone running. My favorite quote: Bubba Blue,\nMykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) said: \"Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue\nit, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Deys uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried,\nstir-fried. Theres pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp\nsalad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- thats about it.\". My favorite scenes: Forrest showing\nhis buttocks to the President. When he sees \"Jeannie\" (Message in the Bottle) in Washington, D.C., they meet at the pool\nof the ellipse. They were again briefly like peas and carrots! Forrest sees \"Lieutenant Dan\" Gary Senise (Apollo 13), he\njumps into the ocean and his boat crashes! The little feather that flies at the beginning and end of movie. The music is\ngreat! This is one of the best movies ever made and that is all I have to say about that!",

    "reviewTitle": "Classic Film!",
    "reviewBody": "Spoilers!First, it was a classic film, which should have won all the awards it did. Second - it could have been\nbetter.Gump is a tall tale, a cliched tour, of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. One man, a slightly retarded\nindividual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and/or is the cause of innumerable public\nevents and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood\nMac. Its a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back\nt-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - except:Except that as with any tall tale, the how,\nwhy, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized\nevents, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (its a slow\npoint of the film). Its a joke, here, pathos there. Its a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and\nboring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black\nman - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington\ncrowd - offing the pigs while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set -\nbunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar\nwere heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But its not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as\nit remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which\nwould seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.The pathos is suggested in Gump as\nthe little child of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the\nlike. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dans life, and presents the\nmost emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny\n- and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.However, Gump isnt really a child. A while his\nacceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesnt know enough not to be\nnaive. He doesnt have a choice - and its not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is\nreally a series of screenwriters jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what hes done, or why. Its all a blur of events\nwhich he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. Its only to contradict the story so far when running\nman, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in\nVietnam. Its like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one\nseen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset\nover a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple\nman more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.Ultimately, it could\nbe the writers present a message they didnt intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even\nin desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that\nlife is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that\nlife is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature,\nfriends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even\nto be pitied for it. Its a message film, to be sure. But the message can get lost in the humorous tall tale, because in\nthat sense, its almost two films, instead of one.",

He knows its not right for Jennys boyfriend to hit her.  Hes also very\nloyal.  Even though Lieutenant Dan gives Forrest a hard time, Forrest always stays his friend.  He also keeps his\npromise to Bubba, by starting the shrimp business.  Finally, hes always loyal to Jenny, the love of his life.  She\nchanges with the times, but Forrest always waits for her.  Also, when Forrest goes to visit her grave, he leaves the\nnote that young Forrest wrote to her.  He told his dad not to open it, so he didnt.  That too shows that Forrest keeps\nhis promises.Just when I thought that Tom Hankss performance in \"Philadelphia\" was his best, he comes out with Forrest\nGump.  He is one of the best actors today, if not the best.  \"Forrest Gump\" is a movie youll want to see again and\nagain...its a masterpiece!",

This shocked me a lot, it\nwas just different than other movies, and I could not figure out why.There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best\nperformance. (In my opinion..) I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was simply\nspectacular.This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest, and you dont want anything bad\nto happen to him, and you feel good when he does something right, or when he gets good things, even by luck.It also had\na bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were\nfunnier than the whole Austin Powers movie).Forrest Gump really got into me.. Its a feeling that is a little hard to\nexplain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention youll probably find out how good this movie is,\nand how real things are.. This movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is someone out\nthere just like Forrest Gump.When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the best Actor and\nbest Movie awards.This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are rated higher than this.",

    "reviewTitle": "The biggest thief Ive ever seen.",
    "reviewBody": "I know my one line summary might not be that clear so Im going to explain it to you.  In  1994, we had classics like\n\"The Shawshank redemption\" and \"Pulp fiction\" who were in nomination at the Oscars and were stolen in every category in\nwhich they were nominated.  They were all stolen by \"Forrest Gump\".  These two other movies which were completely\ndifferent in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked.\nAnd the worst part is \"Forrest Gump\" is simply the biography of Forest Gump.  Also, it robbed every movie in the best\nactor category.  Of course it isnt that easy to play someone who is mentally ill but its easier than playing just some\nordinary person and playing it well.  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) lives with his mother and comes from North-West Alabama.\nHowever, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for which he must wear a brace.  When he starts going to\nschool, he is rejected by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named Jenny.  One day after school, while\nForrest and jenny are hanging together, they are surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks\nat Forrest.  He tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get away.  This is the classic scene when\nJenny yells \"Run Forrest, run.\" and as he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are\nunable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have bikes.  As the years pass, Forrest and Jenny (Robin\nWright Penn) go their own way. Forrest gets into the army and goes to Vietnam.  But one night in the camp, all the\nsoldiers are in bed and pass on a Playboy magazine.  When Forrest gets it, he realizes Jenny has her photograph in it.\nFurther on during the war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named Don Taylor (Gary Sinise) but loses his best friend\nBubba.  Also, his lieutenant is left legless because of the accident whereas the only Forrest gets is a bullet in the\nbutt.  When Forrest gets home, he as many things to do.  On of them is to go over to Bubbas parents house to announce\nto them he was killed in combat.  Another thing he does is try to find Jenny.  The movie is a kind of comedy-drama and\nis pretty good.  But I still dont think nor understand how it won best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks) and best\ndirector (Robert Zemeckis) at the Oscars. I mean, if it had really deserved those Oscars, wouldnt it get a higher rank\nthan both \"Pulp fiction\" and \"The Shawshank redemption\" on our top 250 list?  I actually believe that the one who\ndeserved an Oscar more than anyone else in the movie is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Don Taylor.  However, it was almost\nimpossible for him to win that year because we had Martin Landau in nomination for best supporting actor in \"Ed Wood\"\nand he truly deserved the Oscar he won.  So all in all, this isnt a bad movie, its just way too over-rated.",

    "reviewBody": "Perhaps the most interesting aspect in Forrest Gump is its various alternations of certain historical events.  While\nthese scenes (presented in the fashion of archives) which center on interaction with numerous past famous people\nessentially appears to be contrived (not to mention that the film also could have gone further with the satire), this\ncan also serve as some type of source for information on the United States and are amusing and inventive. The\nstorytelling in general, feels like a way to provide some type of information and history of the United States at a\ncertain period. But the film as a whole feels bloated, and along the way, some considerably offensive material can be\nfound here and there.  At one point, theres a feeling that the script is trying to lay down a stereotype people based\non the type of states that they live in.  The script in certain areas takes some humor and/or tries to create satire out\nof people with various physical disabilities along with seemingly attempting to create some humor out of a racial slur\nbased on misinterpretation from the title character.  Certain points in the story are brought up in a relatively low key\nfashion but we still can help to come to a foregone conclusion on the meaning of the particular topics that are\ndiscussed.  Along with that, Forrest Gump occasionally aims for absolutely low brow humor rather than providing more\nnecessary satire.  While the musical score makes for a good set piece, the drama to a certain extent can also rub you\nthe wrong way.  It at times breaks down and treads into sappy territory and can also get pretty manipulative.  Take for\ninstance a small reference to AIDS which by itself feels tagged onto the story.",

It is a modern version of a classic literary theme: the idiot who is thereby wiser than\nthe rest of us.  Forrest is too dumb to hate blacks.

However, my comments\nconcern one (possibly two) odd aspects of the moviePresident Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others\nexcept Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it turns out Forrests actions were pivotal\nin the downfall of Nixon.Theres another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is depicted watching\nAmerican bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976, presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea for no\nparticular reason. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the assassination attempt on Reagan,\nfrom memory. This means that Forrest was running (remember, for no particular reason) for just about exactly the\nduration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest never met President Carter. Is this some sort\nof comment on the Carter administration (perhaps that America lost its way under Carter - a dubious proposition at\nbest) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same landscape\nfeatured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album.

The tagline and the\nfeather prove that it wasnt.I find `Forrest Gump original, intelligent, wise, sly, balanced, complex, heartwarming,\nunbelievably dynamic, witty in one-of-a-kind manner, endlessly touching and enchanting, extraordinary and magical. And,\nfor that matter, one of the best American motion pictures in the history of filmmaking.",

This movie is, at its core, a celebration of mediocrity.  Sort of like the current\npopularity of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\" (which lets the average person feel smart because they can answer easy\nquestions) this movie is designed to make the average person feel great about themselves for being nothing more than\naverage, just like Forrest.I agree with the comments that infer a fascist or totalitarian subtext to this movie.  This\nmovie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they\ntoo, without doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a \"success\" without trying.  A\nsatisfied public is easy to control, for better or for worse . . .",

Do we all have a destiny\nin life or are we all just floating like a feather on a breeze? Gump tries to find this out but all he finds out the\nonly things important in life is the love of true friends, and family. Nothing else matters. Not awards from presidents,\nbeing a football star, or being a shrimping tycoon. Only being in the arms of your true love.This movie is superb in\nevery way.

    "reviewBody": "OK, before I tear this movie to shreds, exactly HOW many Academy Awards did the stupid thing win? No, wait, dont tell\nme. I have a feeling the answer will depress me.This hype--er, movie--is a living testament to the fact that the baby\nboomers are incredible suckers. Its quite simple, really. You make a movie that romanticizes the 50s, 60s and\n70s, and with enough publicity and a good enough soundtrack, no matter how bad the movie is, you have a hit on your\nhands. Now, dont get me wrong. Im not saying the generation is stupid or shallow by any means; Im merely saying that\nperhaps the haze of nostalgia that obstructed their view of the movie screen during Forrest Gump is what made this trash\na hit.Because Forrest Gump is one ridiculous, unbelievable joke followed by another, and when Forrest isnt teaching\nElvis how to dance, giving Lennon the idea for \"Imagine\" or, in an embarrassing scene I only WISH I could call\n\"forgettable\", wiping his face on a clean shirt and making a smiley face with the dirt by accident (\"Have a nice day,\"\nhe says to the man who gave him the shirt, thankfully ending one of the \"clever\" scenes that surely had everyone rolling\nin the aisles); his life is taking another depressing turn that makes this less \"feel-good movie of 1994\" than \"number 1\nmovie of 1994 to commit suicide to\". Hes born crippled with an IQ of 75; the neighborhood kids taunt and throw rocks at\nhim; his \"girlfriend\" Jenny leads him on hopelessly while sleeping with every man in America except for him; his best\nfriend dies in Vietnam and his superior has his legs blown off. Feelin good yet? Oh, it gets better.But even if Forrest\nGump IS depressing, that doesnt make it a bad movie. What makes it bad is, as I said before, the silliness. Sure,\nputting him in all those vintage newsreels is cute and even pretty cool to see. But the cuteness wears thin pretty soon,\nand is replaced by more ridiculous events in which Forrest inadverently alters NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICA,\nFOR THREE ENTIRE DECADES. Maybe thats appealing to some people, but not for me. For me, it makes the movie completely\nunbelievable, and whats more, stupid. This is not cute, and I certainly wasnt feeling good when I realized Id wasted\nover two hours of my life listening to Forrest Gumps preposterous anecdotes.In the end, the movies few saving\ngraces--the good but predictable soundtrack (\"For What its Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield in a Vietnam scene...great!\nOnly 300 other movies before have done the exact same thing!), and the interesting effects with the newsreels--fail to\nrescue this bomb from the clutches of mediocrity. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can have Oscars coming out of their\nfriggin ears, for all I care...this movie will only ever amount to a 5 out of 10 in my book.",

Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual\neffects and editing techniques.  \"Forrest Gump\" is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.\nThe cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later.  Robert\nZemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that\nwas hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of\n\"Schindlers List\", may be the best and most important film of the 1990s.

At least in my book.Though it\ndiffers from the book - or should I say it has nothing to do with the book by Winston Groom at all except for the name\nForrest Gump and ping-pong - it has an almost literary quality to it: its the kind of epic and insane saga one can find\nin one. The life and adventures of Forrest Gump are a modern equivalent of Munchausen, but this time around, the liar\ntells the truth. Forrest Gump is a perfect human being, a bit on the slow side, Ill admit - but he is honest, he is\nrighteous and he never wants to do anyone any harm.This film is also a meandering look at modern American history, its\npolitics and society, and the distance that Forrest himself sets between the events and actually understanding them is\nthe kind of distance we all feel sometimes - or want to feel more often. His ability to walk away unscathed from any\nhappening is one I sure would like to have.I short put, this film is one I will remember for the rest of my life.",

It\nisnt a totally glorious story.  Nor is it the story of wealthy, clever people (and their shrinks) from the cities -\nthats for the Woody Allens of the world, and their admittedly important and valuable studies of interior worlds.  This\nis an expansive survey of what makes America what it is.  Zemeckiss answer is the nearest thing to Frank Capras deeply\ndemocratic concept of America as a collection of ordinary, not-too-bright, people who are sometimes misled by their\n\"leaders\", sometimes beguiled into temptation, who make mistakes but collectively stumble and fumble to a generally\nbenign destination guided by wisdom and good intentions that few of them possess consistently as individuals but which\ncomprise the collective sum of their histories. Tom Hanks must be a genius to play the Everyman, Mr America.  It seemed\nto be the role Dennis Weaver was destined for after Duel; its the role Dennis Hopper achieved once in Easy Rider; its\nthe role Gary Cooper and James Stewart filled in Capras films; but none of them had to carry quite so much of a film as\nHanks does here.",

    "reviewBody": "Six years have passed since we first saw Forrest Gump. At first is was highly praised and has since slowly died off. I\nbelieve that ten years from now, Forrest Gump will be regarded as an American classic.  The last time I watched \"Gump\"\nwas about three years ago and it was wearing thin. Having watched it so many times, it began to loose its punch. You\nrealize that it is VERY fictional and that it is not nearly as good as 1994s Best-Picture runner-up Pulp Fiction. But,\nhaving watched it recently I was able to enjoy it again, more than I did the first time, because of the great\nperformances by all, and the unforgettable moments.  Forrest Gump is destined to become a classic due to its great,\nheart-warming story, and classic lines that will be repeated like those from Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, and other\nfavorites. The main reason though, is that Forrest Gump is a lesson in 1900s American history. The sixties were a\ncrazy-ass time, and Im glad I didnt have to live in them(Im only 20). Politicians being assassinated, Vietnam, drugs,\nand the Cold War all depicted in their actual footage. Actual broadcasts of Nixons resignation, the Apollo landing, and\nnewscasts of politicians such as Ford, Reagan, and Gov. Gorge Wallace. \"Gump\" is a great movie.

Forrest Gump is\nheart-warming and spiritually uplifting in another words .Technically , Forrest Gump is a perfect motion picture . The\ncinematography , the music score and script are ones of the best , if not the best . And the special effect and sound\nare the best I have seen . Immaculately done computer generated graphics are totally genuinely looking and even\nunbelievable today . It deserved all the 13 nominations it garnered although it got only six as it competed with many\nstrong entries in technical fields ( musical , art direction , cinematography and etc ) .I totally hate Pulp Fiction\nwhich many people here prefer over Forrest Gump because its such a pointlessly violent film which makes foul language\nsound cool . The Shawsank Redemption is a fine film but not as great as many people have claimed . In any light ,\nForrest Gump is a classic , a box office success ,  award recognizing film that has a place in American Film Institute\nTop 100 films of all time .",

Forrest Gump is a good movie but it isnt in the same league as TSR or PF. Will the academy ever apologise for\nthis mistake and many others? I think they should.Tom Hanks was good, but the real winner was Morgan Freeman. Robert\nZemeckis did a great job, but what Quentin did.....WOW. Forrest Gump is a wonderful film, but in this year against Pulp\nand esp. Shawshank it shouldnt have won.This (Forrest Gump) is a great indication that the academy awards dont always\nget it right, this comes mainly through the hype which surround some movies therefore maybe the oscars should  be held a\nyear later when the hype is gone. (Titanic vs. L.A. Confidential another example) Then the real winners will win\nhopefully.1994 was a great year but the academy got all the main oscars wrong (best actress was Natalie Portman for\nLeon), what a shame.Nevertheless my rating for Forrest Gump is 8/10",

    "reviewTitle": "2 points regarding the power of this film",
    "reviewBody": "I want to make two observations that I have not seen in the over 160 reviews of this film that I just read on this\nsite.1)  One thing that Forrest does not embody, something which our culture is drowning in, is sarcasm.  (For\naccessible examples, read many of the reviews for this film!)  That is one of the reasons people find it surprisingly\nmoving.  If you watch a lot of popular movies, not to mention sitcom TV, you might think that sarcasm is the natural\nidiom of communication.  But then, when someone actually asserts something and takes a stand for something (other than\nself-seeking sex or egotistical domination) without a whiff of sarcasm, the effect can be stunning.We have forgotten\nthat sarcasm is parasitic on somebody actually asserting something.  To cut through the garbage of life we should be\nable to distance ourselves from the false parts of it, and that is what sarcasm does.  But sarcasm cannot assert\nanything except its derision of someone elses assertion.  It is derivative and parasitic.  To see someone who is\nwithout sarcasm, as we see in Gump, can be an eye-opening and truly moving experience, opening us to a vision of life\nwhere there is something to believe in, and not just something to mock.This is not a question of Gumps (low)\nintelligence, though our culture often likes to think that sarcasm is the sine qua non of intelligence.  It is about a\ndesire to commit and risk.  Sarcasm falls silent in the face of life honestly lived in adherence to values worth\nstriving after.  Hence, all we are left with are tears when we see someone without sarcasm and guile who lives a life of\nloyalty and love.2) The recitation of recent history may seem a frivolous excuse for a few jokes, but the whole point of\nit detonates in the penultimate scene where Forrest talks to Jennys grave.  He asks \"Is it Lieutenant Dan who is right,\nor is it Momma?\" (or words to that effect).  He is asking if we are all fated in a predeterministic way or if we are\ntruly free to make our own destiny.  His answer--\"I think its both\"--rings true for many people, and hence is a powerful\ncomment on all of life.  Both the capriciousness of history and a sense of something coming from it are acknowledged,\nand that speaks to me.The feather seems to be blown around randomly, but it comes to rest in strategic places.  Gods\ngrace works within the context of our human freedom, and, in the end, this is a film about grace.",

Who can believe a guy who runs across America for 3 years just because he felt\nlike it all of a sudden? If all the things that happen to Gump really happend to one person, that person would be a\nnational celebrity if not an icon. Yet Gump seems to end the movie as a relatively anonymous character. Some might say\nthis adds to the charm of the story, that this guy could be involved in all these extraordinary happenings without\nreally knowing the consequences of his actions and what was going on around him. I think this merely adds to the flawed\nnature of the film. SPOILER ALERT Having said all of this, the movie maybe has one redeeming feature.My girlfriend was\nin tears by the end when Jenny dies. Maybe this works as a love story.  But i wouldnt watch this film just on that\nbasis. In fact i wont ever watch this film again unless someone offers me a serious amount of money, which lets face it\nis about as realistic as most of this movie!",

    "reviewTitle": "Not worthy",
    "reviewBody": "I am surprised that `Forrest Gump made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is\nthat had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesnt fit together.When I first saw the\nfilm, I didnt understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some\nplaces. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two\nand a half hour film; it didnt work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed,\nunder the guise of a 75 IQ. Im no expert, but I dont see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be\nhit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didnt yield rocket scientists. This is\nbecause common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person\ncannot recite ten numbers backwards doesnt mean that they will drop their pants on TV.Im lingering on this because it\nannoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film\n`Being There, Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler.\nHowever, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.Next up on the\ndocket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I dont like\nheavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon or `Apocalypse Now, and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As\nfor the aftermath, Lieutenant Dans post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voights character in `Coming Home\nthat I would sue for copyright infringement.The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan.\nRobin Wrights dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks\nis overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the films Best Picture Oscar, I can only\nconclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they\nselected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction.`Forrest Gump has highlights however. The bus\nstop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at\nthe end of the film sticks with you.Make your own decision, Im playing it safe with a 5/10.",

But through all these things that you could that would make this sound like an awful movie, there is one\nthing that you cannot deny.  This movie moved people.  Told from the naive and Simple-minded Gump, it trawls through\nVietnam, the US Hippy Age, and numerous events at the Whitehouse, showing that Gump has had a far more interesting life\nthan he would ever let on.  It is essentially a love story, as he continues in his mission to win over his childhood\nsweet heart.  It is told completely in flash back until the last few minutes, and as a brilliant Tom Hanks unravels the\nstory for his audience, delivering line after line of unknowing yet amazingly poignant statements, you sort of realise\njust how good it was to be totally ignorant things.  Maybe this movie was not as great as everyone said it was. In\nrealisation, it did not deserve the heap of Oscars it got.

The plot is now\nfamiliar to all - Tom Hanks plays a man with a lower-than-average IQ whose life becomes intertwined with the major\nevents and people of recent U.S. history.In the film he: - inspires Elvis how to swivel his hips - see Governor George\nWallace attempt to stop high school integration - becomes a phenomenal college football player - fights in the Vietnam\nwar and rescues several soldiers - speaks at a huge anti-war rally - becomes a millionaire philanthropist through shrimp\nfishing and wise investments - witnesses the Watergate break in - runs across America several times - meets John Lennon\n- creates several well known sayings - becomes a ping-pong champion and travels to China to compete - meets three U.S.\npresidentsWhats fascinating is that as amazing as these accomplishments sound, they really dont mean very much to\nGump. His only need is just to be with his life-long sweetheart Jenny. His pursuit and ultimate winning over of her is\nreally all that matters to him. It is the execution of this simply story against the vast events of history that makes\nthis film absolute magic.Everything about this film works, and works well. The cinematography, the music, the script,\ndirection, and of course, the acting. The special effects in this film are also remarkable, but they are used fairly\nsparingly, and act more as a supplement to the story, rather than becoming the story itself, as in many other films.\nRobert Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors, and this film will probably be remembered as his magnum opus.10/10",

    "reviewBody": "OK, unlike some of you, I am not going to slam this film out of anger just because it beat out \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"The\nShawshank Redemption\" on the 1994 awards circuit.  Yes, this film was made with broad eyes and simple minds.  Yes, it\npartially served as a candy-coated time capsule for those narcissistic baby boomers.  Yes, as usual, the film is loaded\nwith Zemekis right-wing ideals clumsily disguised as cuddly Hallmark Card sentiments. One thing that may have bothered\npeople is how American this film is.  It is SO American, so much so that I ask you to think of a recent film that is so\nAmerican that isnt completely set in some military environment. Nonetheless, I loved the epic scope and reach of this\nfilm.  It restored my belief that people still want to make \"magical\" films.  The breadth of this film is as close to an\nold MGM musical as were going to get these days.I dont think Tom Hanks was playing over-the-top (that endeavor belongs\nto Al Pacino), he hit the note just right with his mix of innocence and morality.  Gary Sinise got damn lucky with this\nfilm.  Like Richard Gere, Sinise suffers from the John Travolta syndrome; theyre all good actors who have a habit of\npicking bad movies.  But Sinise must have known how juicy this role was, his poker-face reaction to the New Years party\nis just incredible.  Robin Wright-Penn also gave a great performance, and you have to give credit where credit is due;\nThe role of Jenny is one of a few female characters in film whose purpose of existence is not defined solely through the\nmale lead (although her story is chronicled on a separate timeline than Forrests).  The Bubba character was given a\ngood dose of sympathy to prevent him from becoming a Southern country-boy caricature.  And his friendship with Forrest\ndemonstrates an indifferent towards American racism that only a child is capable of (also remember, these two guys are\nfrom the South).  I was most impressed with the song medley they concocted for the running sequence.  The scene takes\nplace in the late 70s, and they choose all these classic 70s songs that have themes of movement or travel (\"Go Your\nOwn Way,\" \"Running On Empty,\" \"On The Road Again,\" \"Against The Wind\"). It is all edited together quite wonderfully.\nIm not a huge Zemekis fan (I think his Spielbergian tendencies are a little obvious at times), but this is a beautiful\nfilm.",

The actors are great: Tom Hanks gives a very tender performance, made by innocence\nand surprise, Robin Wright is the lost angel full of sadness, Gary Sinise shows us all the rage and self-destruction of\nhis character and Sally Field is the Mum we all wish to have. Great work behind the scenes with the beautiful score by\nAlan Silvestri and the great photography of Don Burgess. Special effects are exceptional.

The\nentire cast turns in brilliant portrayals of their own, from Robin Wright to Sally Field, with several \"scene stealers\"\nfrom the talented Gary Sinise.\nEric Roths screenplay (based on the novel) was nothing short of genius and it kept you riveted to the screen as the\nstory unfolded, waiting to see the next chapter in Forrests unbelievable life.  Even after countless viewings, I am\nstill mesmerized. Through the wonders of special effects, the life of Forrest Gump is intertwined with a string of\nhistorical events resulting in a poignant journey of life through one mans eyes.  Through all that happens to him he\nnever loses sight of the one thing that is missing from his life - his Jenny.  His love for her is the backbone of this\nmovie and is one of the most moving love stories I have seen on the big screen to date.\nAll in all, the Best Picture Oscar was more than deserved.  While its competitors were all excellent movies in their own\nright, Forrest Gump offers a complete movie going experience - romance, action, comedy, history, brilliant direction, a\nunique screenplay and outstanding performances. What more could you possibly ask for?  A refreshing piece of film-making\ngenius that is sure to become a classic in years to come.",

It is\nabsurd how a man from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled in American history -\nbecoming a war hero, meeting several presidents, playing ping-pong in China. Its really a comment on American life. In\na way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman.

    "reviewTitle": "I can see why people might dislike this film, but...",
    "reviewBody": "... I gotta say, I love it!  Whether you agree with me will probably depend on whether the whimsical tone of the film is\nlikely to make you want to smile or puke.  As I said, Im in the former camp, but I can well understand anybody who\ndisagrees.  This film is certainly a devisive topic amongst my friends and I, faintly dodgy politics and all (more on\nthat later...)Before I offer my critique of the film, I just wanna touch on two issues that are vaguely related.\nFirstly, the IMDB lists \"The Deer Hunter\" as a recommendation to those who like this movie.  What??  Let me assure you,\ntwo more movies that are so totally different as these pair would be hard to find.  There is a VERY tenuous possible\nlink with Vietnam, but aside from that were dealin with chalk and cheese.  I recommend cinema and/or De Niro buffs\ncheck out \"TDH\" for completist sakes, because its good, but IMHO vastly over-rated (I know people will say the same\nabout \"Forrest Gump\"!). Anyhow, the tone of the two films is completely different, so in my estimation a slight error\nwithin the IMDB there...Secondly, I know people complain because there was a crop of other good movies to get a Best\nPicture nod in 94, and \"Gump\" beat them to it. Most - if not all - of the films nominated that year would have been\ndeserving winners.  It just so happened that the Academy plumped for Gump (sorry about the excruciating rhyme...)  This\ndoes not devalue Forrest Gump against the more dramatic pictures any more then it reflects badly on the runners up. It\nwas just a very good period for film, and all us cinema fans should be thankful for that...Now that Ive got that off my\nchest, back to the film in question.  I feel that Hanks performance stays just on the right side of cloying\nsentimentality, always threatening to tip over the edge, but never quite doing so.  This must be testament to Hanks\nskill as an actor, as with many other actors in the role the character could have become fiercely irritating during the\nlengthly running time.  Again, Im well aware of the arguments that say the character was annoying from the START, but I\nnever felt that to be the case.An able supporting cast serve to back up Hanks, and there is a wonderful turn from Gary\nSinise as \"Lt Dan Taylor\".  His character ALMOST threatens to inject some edge into the characters ultra-PC universe,\nbut maybe that reflects the fact that the other characters are so wholesome rather than that he is nasty.(SPOILERS)Its\na fun jaunt through some 40 years (I think...) of history, refreshingly not confined entirely to American culture.  John\nLennon makes an appearance at one stage (You could argue that he represents cross-culture, but Im claiming him as\none of our own, even though Im not a Scouser but a Manc).  To those who think part of the fun in watching a movie is\npredicting events, this one wont provide you with much of a challenge.  I recommend sitting back and allowing yourself\nto be drawn into the movie universe.As other users have pointed out before me, the film can possibly be seen as having a\nreactionary viewpoint.  Having the main female character die of AIDS as a consequence of her earlier hedonist actions\nseems depressingly intolerant if it was intended to convey some sort of message to the audience.  I have no idea if\nevents in the book are the same.  For those of you looking for deep subtextual material, its certainly a juicy bone of\ncontention, but the film can be enjoyed just as well on a purely simplistic level.  I dont think the political bias is\nstrong enough to ruin the film. As for my view on whether any such connotation was deliberate, lets just say it\nwouldnt surprise me...(SPOILER END)To close, many of my friends voice much the same objections about the film that I\nhave seen on this site.  If the potential for nostalgia combined with goofy fantasy doesnt sound like it will be your\nthing, then by all means avoid.  If, however, the concoction I have described sounds suited to your tastes, then enjoy;\nbecause I guarantee you wont find many better examples of this type of thing around.",

    "reviewTitle": "Surprisingly enjoyable",
    "reviewBody": "Theres something of a tradition in fiction of using the idiot savant to hold the mirror up to society and reflect its\nfoibles. The figure of the Good Soldier Schweik was one I remember being introduced to in my early years at university.\nForrest Gump is also a soldier for much of this pictures duration, but the satire is diluted to no more than a few bum\nand fart jokes in the presence of the great and the good.Maybe its this evasiveness that caused this film to attract\nsuch a storm of criticism from the Left when it first appeared. Seven years on, its hard to see the films reluctance\nto take on biting social satire as something it deserved to be damned for. More likely, its the films unflattering\nportrayal of the counter culture of the sixties that made its baby boomer critics touchy. For the most part, its a\ngentle and appealingly whimsical picture. Australian - and more particularly, Melbourne - viewers will recognize in it\nsomething of the spirit of Michael Leunigs cartoons. In keeping with this spirit is the one aspect of this film that\ncould be regarded as controversial, which is its scepticism toward causes.\nTom Hanks is excellent. It says something about the rest of the worlds stereotypes about American culture that one of\nAmericas biggest movie stars can hold the screen for hour after hour while remaining the most self-effacing of actors.\nThere is charm and real emotion in his performance. If the film sometimes veers into sentimentality (and it does) it is\nnot Hanks fault. The film isnt a masterpiece. As I say, it does sometimes lapse into sentimentality, and it annoys me\nthat, like Rain Man, it cant acknowledge disability without conferring on its disabled characters superhuman talents of\none kind or another. And, as Im sure others have pointed out, the trick shots involving Gumps encounters with various\nhistorical personages had already been done - to much sharper comic effect - by Woody Allen in Zelig. However, for me\nthe films greatest specific failing is that it doesnt do more with the character of Gumps love, Jenny, who doesnt do\nmuch more in this film than turn up every half hour or so and look beautiful. I thought there was scope there to explore\nthe nature of their mutual dependence more deeply, and to illuminate both characters in the process. To some extent this\ndoes happen with the character of Lieutenant Dan, a nicely drawn character who provides the right sort of counterweight\nto Gump.I dont expect that I will want to see this film again and again, the way I keep going back to Leunigs\ncartoons, which have a kind of natural wisdom-in-innocence that Zemeckis film sometimes visibly strains to achieve.\nIts not a film that particularly goes anywhere, not that it really means to. But, a little to my surprise, I did enjoy\nwatching it.",

    "reviewBody": "...because when you have unprotected sex with an HIV positive woman, and that woman has a child, you run a sort of,\nwell, \"high risk\" of receiving HIV (especially Forrest Jr).  I guess \"Jennay\" forgot to tell that to Forrest before she\ndied.  GET TESTED, FORREST, and RUN!I dont mean to be abrasive, but after a second viewing of \"Forrest Gump,\" I noticed\nthis glaring omission.  Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have\nincluded something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.  To me, this is\na giant hole in the film, and one that needed to be addressed.And regarding the film itself...Personally, Im in the\nmiddle; I dont love or hate \"Forrest Gump.\"  The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the\nfilm, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable\nand humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.  In the\nend, the good outweighed the bad slightly, and I came away satisfied but not totally pleased.  Zemeckis has made better\nfilms (try \"Back to the Future,\" \"Contact,\" and even \"Cast Away\"), and so has Hanks.I recommend \"Forrest Gump\"\nmarginally because it has a good heart and a good, interesting story...but it also has its fair share of flaws.  \"Pulp\nFiction\" and especially \"The Shawshank Redemption\" deserved the Academy Awards, but oh well...dont complain over\nsomething so trivial...awards dont mean THAT much.\"Forrest Gump\" can have a 7/10 from me.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Film, Horrible Message",
    "reviewBody": "I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director\nRobert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface,\n`Gump is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though\nis a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who havent seen\n`Forrest Gump, the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ\nof 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig-like fashion.  Forrest\ninadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally\nbecomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his\ntravels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship - and he can never seem to fully\ncapture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn) - but through sheer niceness and through blind\nfaith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in\nlife.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, theres no\ndoubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump - he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest\nGump a childlike innocence, but theres more to it that that; theres a certain confidence that he exudes at all the\nright times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple\nfigure he appears to be at first glance, and I cant think of any actor who couldve played it better than Hanks.  Robin\nWright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened\ncynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  Im surprised she wasnt nominated for an Oscar as well.\nGary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who cant seem to\ntravel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny\nand sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid,\nand `Forrest Gump should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump is a bitter, bitter\nmovie.  Look at Jennys dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually\naccomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gumps friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes\nnever ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no\nambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence,\nthose who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely\nrewarded.  Considering that some of Jennys dreams (and Lieutenant Dans) are particularly selfish - in fact, a few are\ndownright noble - I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me\nnot like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump gets an overall grade of a\nC+ -- it starts out as an `A, but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be\nwrong.  Its simply the Mad Reviewers opinion.  Good or bad, theres some great performances, and its also\nthought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.",

The supporting cast,\nespecially Gary Sinise, Sally Field and Robin Wright are also magnificent and together they all put the cherry on the\ncake for this movie.I agree that it is a (sort of) American movie but that doesnt make it a bad or wrong movie. It\nwasnt overrated in the slightest because it is such a great movie and I believe that it deserved all of the credit and\nawards that it receievd.If you love movies and Tom Hanks (like moi!) and are willing to watch anything with an open mind\nthen do yourself a favour and see it.

They did set up more story elements and pretty much a 4th movie, I expected this to be a trilogy. I honestly\ndont mind if they make more John Wick films but how can they top this one? Its gonna be difficult.Are you angry,\nJohn?Yeah.",

After that, it drops off a bit in my opinion up\nuntil the final sequence.Certainly an enjoyable movie, but I wouldnt go near this unless I absolutly loved action\nmovies. Its just straight up action. Thats it. If you like that, you will love this.Personally though, after about 60\nminutes I got a bit tired of the movie, As much as the actions scenes are great, they lacked unqiue elements later on in\nthe movie. Theres only so many times someone getting headshotted can be entertaining.I gets a 7 from me, good\ncinematography, great choreography, average acting at best, okayish script (did not like the ending)",

    "reviewTitle": "A brutal non-stop ride",
    "reviewBody": "About 6 months ago I saw a picture of the set of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum featuring Keanu Reeves on horseback\nshooting at motorcyclists. It was such a great looking shot that I have been waiting eagerly to see how it looked in the\nactual film ever since. It did not let me down. The style this film possesses is insane. It is one of the best looking\naction films I have ever seen.The pacing of this film is also incredible. It starts the action immediately and almost\nnever lets up. I cant wait to see what the death count was in this film because it will be truly enormous. The only\nproblem is when the death count is that high the film can struggle to keep the originality up. After a while each death\nstarts to look very similar to the last, and the 50 before that, and it can even become a little tedious to watch.The\nonly other flaw I came across with the film was that John Wick is on the defence too much. Instead of being angry and on\nthe hunt like the first two films, for the majority of the Chapter 3 he is in survival mode. Still very fun to watch,\nbut it isnt quite the same as seeing him take brutal revenge.And the film is brutal. I could be wrong but I dont\nremember the first two entries in the series making me cringe in terms of violence as much. There were some very hard\nthings to watch at times in this movie even for me, and I pride myself on handling those sorts of things fine most of\nthe time. One of them early on got an audible gasp from the entire audience and I saw multiple people having to turn\ntheir heads to the side.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is two hours of your life that will pass by very quickly.\nThis is as non-stop action as films get. I think this is the third best action series currently producing movies (after\nJames Bond and Mission Impossible). Will it get a third one? The first entry on the trivia page suggests no, however\nthe end of this movie suggests yes? I guess we will have to wait to find out. For now enjoy the hell out of this one.",

    "reviewTitle": "Pure, delirious joy in the form of yet another exhilarating thriller",
    "reviewBody": "Following on from two deliriously entertaining, visually gorgeous and blissfully simplistic thrillers, John Wick:\nChapter 3 - Parabellum keeps up the franchises unique appeal in stunning fashion. Complete with electrifying action,\nbeautiful cinematography, a pulsating score and a great sense of humour, the film is pretty much as purely joyful as\naction thrillers get, and proves two hours of brilliant entertainment.Before I get into all of that, though, one of the\ngreatest things about this franchise is just how simplistic it is. You may have seen John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2,\nyou may not have done. Going into this third film, however, its all pretty irrelevant, and while the first two films\nare certainly worth your time, absolutely anybody can go and watch this movie without any prior knowledge, and simply\nsit back and watch the fireworks.The plot is effectively laid out for you in the first ninety seconds of the movie. John\nWick is excommunicated, and theres a $14m bounty on his head. Thats it. Following that brief bit of exposition are two\nhours of beautifully simple yet endlessly entertaining action, and while the film does keep you engrossed with its sense\nof mystery and intrigue surrounding this world of allegiances and deception, its the thrill of the chase that really\nmatters.In that, theres almost never a moment where storytelling takes precedence over action thrills, with the movie\nbursting into life by way of an exhilarating opening act. However, much like the first two films, not every moment is\nfighting and shootouts, with the mystery, the tension and the intrigue all playing a part as John Wick encounters\nnumerous people from his past in all manner of different scenarios.There are moments in its middle portion that do drag\na little more than others, and where the story perhaps gets a little self-indulgent, however theres no denying just how\nslick and purely entertaining a thriller this is regardless.Of course, the action itself is brilliant as well. The\nopening act is astonishing, filled to the brim with insane action that features seamless fight choreography, brilliant\ncamerawork and a fantastic sense of self-awareness that allows you to laugh at the most ridiculous moments. From then\non, the film continues to burst into life with mad, energetic and dazzling action sequences again and again, only\nfurthering the sheer entertainment appeal of the whole affair.Also, theres no getting away from just how good-looking a\nmovie this is. The camerawork in the fight sequences is certainly excellent, but its the films kaleidoscopic colour\npallette and slick cinematography that makes it a feast for the eyes, pulling off the style of a pure pulp thriller in\nbrilliant fashion once again, and with a pulsating, intense score playing throughout to boot, youll definitely be on\nthe edge of your seat from beginning to end.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum isnt much different from the\nprevious two movies. It isnt the worlds most intricate or intelligent thriller. However, with brilliant energy,\ndazzling visuals, stunning action and an invaluable sense of fun, absolutely none of that matters, and it instead proves\na solidly entertaining, manic and dizzyingly joyful thriller throughout.",

Because the movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes long, only action and no narrative makes the action repetitive and\nboring. The ending also felt really cheap. The promise they made in the second movie is only prolonged by a similar\nending in this one. What will likely be John Wick 4, should have been the second half of this movie.

    "reviewBody": "Ive been looking at John Wick since 2014 and I can say that I did not expect him so much, all my expectations were\nfocused on Avengers: Endgame (which was Wow, an end of the colossal era) and I I was busy and I went to the cinema (with\nfew ideas about the movie) and I can say that this movie is Avengers: Infinity War edition 2019. I hope that those\npeople have a break so that they can find the best ideas for a second trilogy. Unfortunately, this movie will help\nAvatar stay on top, a complex action movie and a gorgeous screenplay, find out John Wicks real home and see how he was\nphysically injured twice, and the second which was brutal and unexpected (I am referring to the end of the film) I was\nshocked and satisfied because now he has another reason to take revenge.",

    "reviewTitle": "Slick sequel but could have been more",
    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the first two productions of John Wick, really looking forward to the third one. Overall it was enjoyable but\nfelt a little flat towards the end. Keanu Reeves was great as usual. I am not so sure about Halley Barrys performance,\nfelt too forced at some point, though, she fought just as well. I wished the story would have revealed more about the\nworld of the characters introduced rather than just en passing, have less but sharp action sequences but more of the\nstory development on the different factions. The best fight sequences are in the beginning, after that it seems a little\nrepetitive. Some parts of the actions felt confusing. One example is when John Wick faces two opponents in the\nCasablanca alleyway, while holding onto one knife attacker to fight the other, the first opponent remains inactive far\ntoo long to be unrealistic. It feels like the director compromised with that shot. Another scene in the end fight where\ntwo attackers with turtle neck sweater and jacket, both intentionally look similar going up against Wick. Wick kills one\nof them, but the other never reappears. I will have to watch it again to make sense. I will hold out on the third one\ngiving it the benefit of the doubt as it leads to the fourth installment. I hope theres a better payoff. My 2 cents\ntake on this one.",

Its been a long dam time but this was an awesome performance on her part.The real letdown here is for all the\namazing use of practical effects and wonderful action and choreography, the minimal and limited CGI used, was outrightly\nterrible.Every gun shot had CGI blood splatter, and they looked terrible. If they had just used no blood splatters at\nall, that would have been even better. Some knife play scenes where the knife went into a persons body, looked super\nfake. The terrible CGI really took me out of the film.There is a major climatic scene where John falls off of a very\nhigh building, Its obviously CGI, and terribly so.For one of the few major scenes where a lot of CGI was used they could\nhave made sure that one scene looked as good as possible.But they didnt.",

John Wick 3 is as you would expect jam packed with action, great scenes and even builds upon the world\nthat we already know in a very, very good way.The fight choreography is absolutely amazing and John is as usual utterly\nbad-ass, beautiful locations come into this chapter that we havent seen in the previous two and theres a reasonably\ngood level of over the top \"wow\" moments to the point of the audience literally laughing at how insane it is\nhowever......something was not quite right with this, I love that it is not what you expect and it hasnt fallen into\nthe last Jedi or game of thrones trap or subversion yet there were, in my opinion, some severe issues with the third act\nof the film.While I can agree that there is a serious amount of poetic license and suspension of belief required to\nenjoy the John Wick franchise it kept it to a level of agreeableness in the first 2 films, it gets somewhat outlandish\nand rather ridiculous unfortunately in this chapter.Overall its a good film, well worth seeing and the action is\nfantastic but the ending is to me very, very odd, the final fight sequence is not great (the first 30 minutes is by far\nthe best part of the film) and some of the characters really dont quite hit the mark, especially, and unfortunately,\nLawrence Fishburne as the Bowery King and Halle Berry as.... cant say due to spoilers.Its the weakest one of the three\nbut its still good, enjoy the action, and enjoy the (majority of) the characters, at the end though I fear you will be\na bit lost to it all, certainly not a great ending to what is otherwise the best action movie trilogy for a long, long\ntime.",

Theres\nnew ideas here and they were well executed (pun intended).Standard brawls and mini fights are a plenty but as I say the\nfilm didnt over rely on them. There was nothing goofy about these, they were quick, intense and they moved you swiftly\nthrough. The more showpiece fight scenes really do show off a higher level of choreography planning but also the actual\nexecution of both audio and visual was immense.Even the plot impressed me. I dont think anyone really watches John Wick\nfilms for the plot but in this one there is a bit more substance to it. At times it does catch you by surprise.There are\nseldom trilogies that improve with each film and depending on how you feel about the first two, this might be one of\nthem.",

    "reviewBody": "John Wick is no longer a small start-up movie that caught our eye and re-energised the revenge genre. The producers of\nJohn Wick, with both eyes clearly on building a profitable franchise, have decided to do a Mission Impossible with The\nSyndicate and 007 with Spectre, and create a super organisation - The High Table. And with it (roll eyes moment) rules,\nregulations, protocol etc which are all becoming too often and too much these days.What this means is, we get an all out\naction-packed opening of 20-odd minutes before the show becomes a platform for product placements and poorly\nchoreographed fight scenes where you can see Keanu acting more than fighting and in fact, struggling to keep up (and\nnot because he is injured or has been thrown about). The fight scenes, many shot wide angle, do not have the energy and\nintensity of the opening sequences and there are many, many moments where you feel oh come on, Johns whole body is\nopen for attack. Laurence Fishburn, Angelica Houston and Halle Berry are wasted and dont even get me started on Asia\nKate Dillon - she is annoying in Billions, even more so here. I am a big fan of the first John Wick, was ho-hum about\nthe sequel but this third one, haiz...cant say Im looking forward to a 4th instalment.

    "reviewTitle": "A masterclass in action movie making!",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 ParabellumSo the easiest way to sum up JW3 is that if like me you enjoyed the first two instalments\nthen this third outing for Baba Yaga will be right up your street.\nThe plot is thin and simple.\nJohn is on the run from every hitman and assassin on the planet and he must come up with some rather creative ways in\nwhich to stay alive.JW3 is a masterclass in action movie making.\nI truly believe stuntmen and women should get Oscars.\nThe work gone into making this sequel is groundbreaking in terms of practical stunts and effects.\nThere also should be a category for best performance in an action role. In which Keanu Reeves would win hands down.\nIn my review for JW2 I said the film left me fatigued with too much repetition.\nOnly after buying the Blu-ray of that movie did I truly appreciate it.\nJW3 on the other hand isnt repetitive in terms of the action sequences.\nTheres some real creativity gone into developing every action scene.\nInventive and impressive are words that can be used to describe each set piece.\nThe opening fight sequence involving a rather tall gentleman and a book sets the tone.\nThen we are treated to knife fights. Fights on horseback, Fights on motorcycles,Fights with guns. Lots of guns!\nOh and theres Halle Berrys attack dogs which are awesome!\nSpeaking of Miss Berry. Shes fantastic and really sells her action scenes.\nSadly though shes a little under-utilised. Her part isnt as big as the trailers would have you believe.\nTheres strong support from 90s straight to video star Mark Dacascos.\nIt was nice to see him again. Hes an accomplished martial artist who never really got the recognition he deserved\nduring his heyday.JW3 is going to be a fine looking movie when it makes its way on to 4K Blu-ray. I believe the HDR in\nthis film will look sublime.\nThe film projected well in the theatre and often cinema screens can look a tad murky.\nIn terms of sound design this film sounded amazing.\nThe final shoot out was truly spectacular.\nEach different gun having its own signature sound.\nBass was really punchy.\nEvery punch, kick and cracking bone could be heard to earsplitting effect.In terms of plot and storytelling this is\nwhere the film stumbles a little. My score for this movie kept fluctuating due to the convoluted plot.\nI think the scriptwriters have tried to build a franchise out of the first films simple premise and it is always\napparent that it seems forced.\nA minor gripe because in terms of the action genre all the John Wick movies must be regarded as all time greats.\nThe JW franchise will become classics of the genre unlike the tripe certain over the hill action stars churn out. (Ill\nname no names but a fat guy with a goatee and a ponytail springs to mind).\nJW will be a classic because theyre inventive, well shot and expertly made.\nEvery punch, kick and shot to the head can be seen.\nTheres no shaky-cam. No choppy editing hiding the fact that the actors cant do the business.\nThe audience are treated to a visual chaotic feast of violence.\nIf indeed this type of thing is up your street then JW3 is going to be one for your Blu-ray collection.\nA film that if judged solely on its action set pieces then its the best of the three.\nHowever overall as a movie we the audience arent emotionally connected to JW3 as we were with the first film.\nIt has a over convoluted plot that expands on the second films flaws.\nStill Im up for John Wick: Chapter 4, Ill be there opening night.",

Somewhere after this things started to lag. I think it was the moment the adjudicator character turns\nup to be fun police. Thats how it felt. Along come the rules to curb the crazy balls out fun we loved in the first\ninstalment.The rest of the movie is a bit scrappy and although we have high velocity action pawn all over the place it\ndoesnt quite hit the spot.I was left puzzled at the end and gave up on ever caring about the next instalment.",

But when\nit comes to build up a \"mythologic\" ambience; some religious, historical, and political facts should have been\nconsidered.(1) Continentals real life equivalent seems to be NATO but judging by the heavy emphasis on Christianity, it\nis most probably Schengen. So the top dog who is claimed to be higher than high table should have been Greek, not\nEgyptian. Ancient Egypt concept would have been appropriate if Continental was a Jewish organisation.\n(2) It is nice to see that Continental is open for former European colonies and have no religious concerns but as I said\nbefore, due to the organisations heavy emphasis on Christianity, a non-Muslim country such as India would have been\nmuch more appropriate than Morocco.\n(3) Even though Parabellum is a Hollywood product, John Wick trilogy has no problem with having a protagonist with\nSlavic origin and a Russian \"not-so-bad\" antagonist. So, Continental would have been spreaded over Balkans as well. It\nwould brillantly suit to Continentals cosmopolitanist nature.",

    "reviewTitle": "Finally an action franchise than doesnt lose its touch!",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and\nrefreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of\nshaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the\nstuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards dont award talent like this is beyond me. There were times\nthat I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and\nthrough glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.As with the previous 2 installments, John Wick 3 is where\nKeanu Reeves is at home. This role was just made for him, and watching him stand toe to toe with powerhouses like Halle\nBerry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Huston, not only shows how good he is as an action star, but as an\nactor in general. He hasnt been given a role this good since the Matrix, but those movies never showed how good he was\njust at acting. He sells this movie.The supporting cast is all amazing, and I loved how they left their characters\nhanging, giving us hope of seeing them in future installments. I also loved how more in-depth the movie spent on\nworld-building. The way it brings in different cultures into this assassin guild is done very well.John Wick 3 is an\namazing action movie that never loses its steam throughout, and its 2 hour run times flies past, because of non-stop\naction that is directed and choreographed to perfection. I cant wait to see if they manage to pull off the 4th like\nthey did here.8.8/10",

It is comically extreme but consistent and logical.\nI can recommend this because of the thought that went into the creation of the world and the elaborate setup for the\nnext film. That setup is tantalising.The idea that what keeps him going, pushes him through is personally attractive. He\nwants to live to remember his wife.",

    "reviewBody": "Para bellum - prepare for war (Latin - English). John Wick is back for more than two hours of hardcore violence with a\nhint of comedy spiced with exhilaratingly exhausting chases all over the globe. Chad Stahelskis John Wick: Chapter 3 -\nParabellum is an epic pandemonium, made to satisfy fans of this franchise, but also to surprise the non-believers with\nhis superbly choreographed fight sequences.This chapter starts where the last film ended. Wick is running out of time\nand in less than an hour he will be excommunicated from the global community of assassins and cant use any of their\nhideouts or facilities anymore. Every assassin in New York will be hunting him down - since the price on his head is a\nstaggering $14 million.If you really think assassins have the patience to wait until the High Table (the global\norganisation of assassins) tells you the hunt has begun, youre in for a surprise. Theres killers everywhere and Wick\nbumps into one very tall man early on in a library, for some close-up combat with books. It doesnt take long before the\nnext battle starts in an antique store where cabinets get shattered to start a lethal knife throwing sequence with\ndeadly consequences.Our man knows he cant keep battling an entire city of assassins forever, he goes looking for a way\nout and this is where we get to know a bit more about John himself. Anjelica Huston plays a cold-blooded woman who knows\nJohn from a previous life. After handing her a talisman he once earned for doing something terrible, hes here to ask\nfor a favour - sneak him out of the US. They owe him that one thing, and Wick is off to Morocco to get rid of his death\nsentence.Once arrived in North Africa, we get another look at Wicks lost past we know so little about. He has another\nmarker/medallion in his pocket, to collect another favour. This one is destined for Sofia (Halle Berry, reminding us how\nbad ass she still is), whose daughter he rescued from an unspecified danger long ago. She has a pair of German shepherds\nwho steal the show as bad guys genitals butchers. The cinematography here is breathtaking, especially when we get to\nthe Sahara and see Wick climbing the dunes in his suit. Its an action packed act that makes you ready for what youre\nabout to witness back in New York City.A representative of the High Table has already arrived in the city and is here to\npunish those who helped Wick break the rules in the last film. The \"Adjudicator\" (Asia Kate Dillon) gives both the king\nof the Bowerys bums (Laurence Fishburne) and director of assassins hotel The Continental, Winston (Ian McShane), seven\ndays to put their affairs in order before theyre removed from their roles. Whatever that may mean. While Wick was on\nhis way back, the Adjudicator visited some sidewalk sushi bar and hired the chef/hitman to lead a crew of assassins that\nwill make an end to John Wicks legacy once and for all.Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his crew, are fans of the legendary\nWick. While they fangirl in between throwing him through glass walls, theyre still here to finish him off. This final\nshowdown happens in Winstons all-glass administrative offices, where nothing is what it seems. Playing with cold glass\nwalls and neon lights has never been more impressive and fun. Even when everything gets smashed to smithereens.With\nevery chapter, this franchise gets bolder and more impressive. This bares the question if they can keep this level of\nexcitement going like other successful franchises, or if this is Reeves magnum opus as Wick?! Id say \"dulce periculum\"\nand keep them coming. Let his legacy live on!",

    "reviewTitle": "A solid continuation of the title characters story",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the third entry in the John Wick action thriller series. Once again directed by\nChad Stahelski and starring Keanu Reeves in the lead role, it is a solid continuation of the title characters story\nwhile adding even more to the world building element set up previously.Immediately after the events of John Wick:\nChapter 2, former assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is on the run after killing a member of the High Table at The\nContinental hotel in Manhattan. With a $14 million bounty now on his head, Wick must find find a way to safely escape\nNew York City, while avoiding death by other assassins from all parts of the world.As reliably action-packed as it is\ngreat to look at, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is so far the best installment of this ever growing franchise which\nserves to remind us that Keanu Reeves is deserving of his place back in the spotlight. Wick is still the \"one man army\"\nforce to be reckoned with, and Reeves again adds that trademark nuance to his performance to help things along nicely.\nHowever, the film also introduces Halle Berrys character Sofia as a helpful accomplice of Wick, showing that she too\nmay also have potential for an action star comeback. Its a shame she does not feature in the story as much as she\nshould but there is hope she will return in the near future. Like its predecessors, the fight scenes are beautifully\nshot, owing to director Chad Stahelskis creative use of lighting and cinematography, giving them a noir-like vibe. In\naddition to this, the film also has some surprisingly funny moments of dark comic relief, which certainly helps ease the\ntension after some graphic violence. Even though the film does take the predictable route of sequel-baiting, I am\ndefinitely on board for any future follow-ups we may having coming our way.I rate it 8/10",

    "reviewTitle": "near non-stop bone-crunching action",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Worlds are colliding! No, no ... not in the way of \"The Avengers\" movies, but its\nkind of hard not to smile when Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne share a scene (or two) in a mini-reunion of THE\nMATRIX. Mr. Reeves and director Chad Stahelski are back for a third time, and somehow they manage to raise the bar yet\nagain on the fight sequences. And lets face it, the fighting and action are why so many are drawn to this franchise.\nThis latest entry runs 2 hours and 10 minutes, and almost every bit is a frantic chase scene or violent fight ... or\nboth.The film picks up mere moments after JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 ended. If you recall, John had killed a member of the\nHigh Table inside the Continental Hotel, an unforgivable break in the treasured rules. Winston (Ian McShane), the\nmanager of the hotel, has given his friend a one hour head start prior to issuing the \"excommunicado\". Its that order\n(and the $14 million bounty) that sends every assassin on the planet on Wicks trail.No need to wait for the good stuff\n... the films first two fight sequences are extraordinary feats of stunt coordination, and consume the first 15-20\nminutes. Here is what John Wick (and we viewers) are in for: Guns (many kinds), lots of knives, a hatchet, swords, a\nbook, enough broken glass to fill a recycle center, horses, motorcycles, cars, every martial art known to man, highly\ntrained dogs, a public library, a museum/collectibles display, a stable, and a ballet theatre complete with dancers.\nThere is even a current NBA player, 73\" Boban Marjonovic, who battles John Wick and ultimately learns books can be used\nfor something other than reading.John Wicks background is revealed, and his general level of tiredness reaches\nexhaustion, which actually adds an element to a character who is quite efficient with his conversation. There are a few\npeople who are called on to help Wick, in particular we have Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Anjelica Huston as\nthe Ballet Director, and Halle Berry as Sophia, a former assassin who now runs the Continental Hotel in Morocco. See,\neven an underworld crime syndicate promotes from within. The segment with Sophia is one of the most fun, and its not\nbecause of Ms. Berry. Rather her beautiful and highly-trained dogs are scene stealers who are devastating in their\ncommitment to carry out orders.Other characters of interest include Asia Kate Dillon (\"Billions\") as the Adjudicator,\none who enjoys doling out punishment; Mark Dacascos (Wo Fat in \"Hawaii 5-0) as Zero, the ultimate Wick fanboy who wants\nnothing more than to be the one who kills him; Jerome Flynn (\"Game of Thrones\") as Berrada, the senior official who\ndoesnt negotiate fairly; Said Taghmaoui as The Elder from the High Table, who listens to Wicks proposal. Other\nsupporting roles are filled admirably by Robin Lord Taylor, Jason Mantzoukas and Susan Blommaert. Of course, some of the\nmost fun occurs again at The Continental Hotel as Reeves Wick interacts with Lance Reddick and Ian McShane.From the\ndepartment of \"Give em what they want\", the film has a very similar look, feel and tone to the first two, but director\nStahelski (a standout stunt coordinator) and writers Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Mark Abrams keep it\nfresh with new characters, new props and some terrific set design. The early model computers are contrasted with the\nhigh tech gadgetry of the Continental, and with a body count likely higher than the first two films combined, this entry\ncan best be described as brutally entertaining ... is that even a thing? The violence is vivid and excessive and\nnon-stop, and if thats not your style, you should at least know that the title is taken from the Latin \"Si vis pacem,\npara bellum\" - If you want peace, prepare for war.",

    "reviewBody": "Parabellum is an absolutely outstanding and genre-refining film. Its been a long while since we had seen any movies\nthat redefined the action genre up till Mission Impossible: Fallout. Not to say that this is better than that, but this\ndefinitely did what no other action movie could since then. Its films like Parabellum that make me love action, the\nkind of movies that I think about when I hear action. Keanu Reeves has absolutely killed it with this role. He is\ninsanely good with action and he just seems to never get too old for it. Halle Berry is incredibly good, and was very\ngood in all her action scenes too. The action in this movie is by far the best part. It looks extremely realistic, and\nis brutal, fun and ruthless in every single way. Cerep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian are back again, and they make some\nvery lovable scenes for Indonesian audiences, back with the jokes and incredible stunt acting. The theater was gasping\nin the first big fight, shocked and slowly realizing what they had actually came in to watch. It is extremely well\nchoreographed with everything being realistic. When theres action, you know whats going on, and you are locked in to\nwhatevers happening. The story is excellent, and just makes so much sense as an excuse for tons of action. The title\n\"Parabellum\" suits this film very well. This world is out for John Wick, as all his comrades learn to pay for their\nmistakes. The whole world turns on him, and this is a plot thats just executed extremely well. The issue with this\nmovie, is that theres a lot going on, and it leads to a small bit of pacing issues. The movie can feel a little bit\nlost at times until you see what happens after the certain scene. Theres also a little bit of bad voice acting in a\nscene, but other than that, not much to complain about. The action shows that the genre can be varied masterfully. We\ndont need magic, superheros or bombs to have a good time at the movie theater. Parabellum is a replenishing, fun and\ninsanely entertaining movie overall. It stands strong as the best John Wick movie so far. This movie is totally worth a\nwatch. If you dont like gore, this is likely not for you. For anyone who has seen the previous films and loved them,\nthis is definitely for you and its the kind of action the film industry has missed for 2 years. You also do not need to\nsee the other ones to understand this, but I suggest just knowing the basic plot of the first 2 films.",

    "reviewTitle": "There is more to it than just mind-blowing action!",
    "reviewBody": "This is the definition of an action film in all of its glory!! I am amazed that this \"franchise\" has done it again with\nanother good entry, only this time the action was turned up to 100. If you thought that the other two \"John Wick\" films\nhad great action, this one blows them out of the water and puts them to shame. Some parts of this film are truly\ninsane.......However as a mentioned in the title this film is more than just action set piece after another, there is an\ninteresting continuation of the story.The first piece of praise has to go to Chad Stahelski who has directed the living\nheck out of this film, in some ways I cannot believe to imagine the headache and joy this film must have been for him.\nThe amount of detail that has gone into this film is something that shouldnt go unnoticed just because it an action\nfilm. Even though the film is very action heavy Stahelski has managed to still careful weave an interesting story\nthroughout that definitely keeps you guessing. He has created the perfect blend of the familiar whilst also introducing\nnew things into the series. Absolutely fantastic from his side of things.The cast all round is fantastic and might be\nthe most solid one out of all three films thus far. The biggest shoutout obviously goes to Keanu Reeves who once again\njust kicks ass in this film whilst still managing to show us this very complex and damaged character. I have heard that\nReeves tries to do as much of the stunt work as possible.....i could be misinformed.......I hope this is true. In\ncertain moments I believe it is because you see his face........yeah I know they could CG his face but.........I will\ngive him the benefit of the doubt. All in all he is fantastic once again.\nOther shoutouts should be for Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Lance Reddick who are all great either\nnew or returning characters.Now the biggest positive of this film is the fight/stunt choreography. To put it mildly it\nis jaw droppingly brilliant, I dont think I know enough words in the English dictionary to describe it. It was pure\naction brilliance on display......this is why the Oscars needs a stunt category. The level set by the previous two films\nhas been completely destroyed and new level has been set not only for this film but action films in general. Every\nsingle action set piece is unique whether it be featuring a different location, weapon or personnel all of them show the\nversatility of action and they seamlessly fit into the film. To be perfectly honest I was shocked at the level of gore\nas well in this film which was definitely not as prevalent in the other two films. Mind-blowing!!!Lastly the villain was\nactually quite good in this one, not like the last entry which wasnt great. It is someone you can completely understand\nthere motivations and intentions as to why they are doing things, its a good performance from Asia Kate Dillion.Overall\nthis film is good, its so close to very good unfortunately there are a couple of minor things that didnt work for me.\nIts just certain character decisions and a scene involving a roof, I wont spoil it, you know what I mean. 75% out of\n100 or 7.5 out of 10, Ive only given it this score because thats the same score I gave the other two films. Id say\nthis one is better than Chapter 2 but not quite as good as the first, from a story and emotional standpoint.Saying all\nof that you will not be disappointed walking out of this pure action blockbuster entertainment from start to finish.",

    "reviewTitle": "Flawed but extraordinary at the same time.",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is good but suffers from its eccentricities. It is a very well made, interesting and\nflawed. The main problem with the film is it feels like it jumps the shark a little and whilst this isnt full jump\nthe shark it does go far enough over that the thread of believability even in a stylised world goes to pot at times.So\nyou have 2 options to ignore the silliness or just go along for the ride. Fortunately, there is a lot to ride on and the\nfilm never gets boring or dull.The action is excellent and the fight scenes are stunning, occasionally slight over\ngruesome and often very funny but always exceptionally well done.The new characters are a mixed bag, with some far more\nsuccessful than others, with Halle Berrys character standing out above all, in what is her best action role.As for the\nmain protagonist, Mark Dacascos is interesting and at times odd and I am not not sure the humorous touches quite\nwork.The more established characters such as Winston and Charon, have more to do in this film but several of the other\ncharacters from previous films do go missing in this film.As for Keanu Reeves, he plays John Wick in a very similar way\nto the first 2 films.The directing and cinematography are excellent, as has been the case with the last 2 films. Chad\nStahelski plays to the films strengths and there is very little time to step back and relax.So despite my problems with\nthe film I did enjoy it and would recommend it to others who enjoyed the last couple of films.",

The well thought action scenes is what continues to be the driving force, with sometimes up to\n10+ mins scenes with pure asskicking. The humor is still one of the films strong points, with a lot of witty comments\nfrom the characters through out its playtime. The characters, old and new, are just as interesting as in the previous\ntitles. As we dig even deeper into the universe, from which Wick was molted by, we truly get an insight of just how\npowerful the organization is, and how long it stretches.All around a fantastic action film, that through well thought\nviolence, slick humor, and interesting characters keeps you hooked all the way. I highly recommend it!",

    "reviewBody": "At this point it is obvious that Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves know how to put together a compelling action movie.The\nmovie follows the same tried and true recipe and goes straight into the action, with most of the exposition out of the\nway in the previous title. John killed someone important and now he is on the run - from EVERYONE.When you have an\nunstoppable action hero movie, it always feels difficult to keep raising the stakes, but they surprisingly manage to do\nit a 3rd time.Does it have the same feeling as the first John Wick? No.Could anything else replicate that? No.Are they\ntrying to achieve that? Also no.The movie is solid on its own. It employs excellent basics from great music to great\nvisual composition, a nice selection of henchmen to be dispatched of by an ever increasingly angry John Wick and a nice\ncast of supporting characters showing up and providing more glimpses into the dark world that John Wick inhabits.There\nare parts of the movie that unfortunately felt a bit repetitive, but I wouldnt detract any points as at this stage it\nis difficult to find new and inventive ways of murdering people (they still do btw!), but this means that some scenes\nmight feel a bit old. Despite this, each action scene is beautifully shot, the camera is still as ever and the feeling\nof force, violence and impact shines through the screen.From brutal takedowns, to great gun fights, horse chases and\neverything in between, John Wick 3 ups the stakes from all points of view.A lot more to say but doing so would spoil it.\nWatch it!",

Not to spoil anything but some of the kills were especially brutal to watch (ie. book... that is\nall)The story does what needs to do with some revelations at the end - the script was quite witty and kept the interest\nwhen theres no action sequence going on, but be rest assured, the whole films an action sequence with occasional\nbreaks.So yeah, watch this as soon as you can.

They are also just brutal and seems so\nrealistic in someway.When that is said the story isnt great but is isnt bad either. But this movie is more about the\naction scenes than the story.The acting is great from all the actors in the movie. Halle Berry does a great job playing\na strong woman and Keanu reeves plays the role of John Wick better than ever.So if you like action movies you NEED to\nsee this movie",

    "reviewTitle": "A Great Piece of Action Cinema",
    "reviewBody": "The best way I can describe the production of the John Wick films is slick. Everything from the direction, camerawork,\nfight choreography, set design, music and lighting is superbly polished, making it gorgeous to watch. John Wick: Chapter\n3 carries this on very effectively.Its just glorious action cinema from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is just a living\nlegend at this point with how he commits fully to the role. Stahelski also rightly gets much praise for how he handles\nthe fight sequences with such grace.Somehow the action has managed to keep on improving from the first instalment, and\nthe brutality is also upped as well, which I didnt think would be possible after what was delivered in Chapter 2.The\nadditions to the cast are also pretty good. Halle Berry is solid, although her character is not involved nearly as much\nas I thought she was going to be. Mark Dacascos was also great as Zero, who was a worthy foe for John to take on in\nhand-to-hand combat. The introduction of Asia Kate Dillon as the Adjudicator was also intriguing, as it gave us our\nfirst glimpse of the mysterious High Table, which undoubtedly will be explored in further films.Also the world-building\nis once again on-point, slowly revealing morsels of information about the society of assassins. However, this is also\nthe films greatest weakness as it expands the world so much that what story there is becomes unfocused.I adore these\nfilms, and whilst this is certainly the weakest of the three, its still a highly-engaging piece. I cant wait to see\nwhat they do next, as the prospect of John teaming up with the Bowery King to take on the High Table sounds great in\nconcept.",

    "reviewBody": "Once again Keanu has given us an unfortunate consequence to not passing on a RIDICULOUS script. This movie would have\nbeen lower if not for the decent action scenes. Now by all means is it not a clean action scene where you Wont tell it\nis a 50+ Keanu walking through a very choreographed fight. Sheesh! 75% of the shots were clear as day when telegraphing\na strike.\nHale Berry was an unnecessary addition. So was the first act. This script is all over the place. I wasnt sure whether\nany of the exposition was important for his ties to a Russian smuggling ballet/sombo/smuggling ring since it only showed\n15 minutes then was just tossed out like nothing. The over used \"dog\" line felt redundant and unnecessary. World\nbuilding clearly was a thing Lionsgate is hoping for. Rather than rush details about the \"high table/under the table\"\nuniversal rules lets break it down at some point.\nThis movie was too soon, it clearly needed a better script/screen play/ stunt work/ story line/ and laws of what is\ncapable.I liked the first John wick. It provided an almost mystery as to who this guy is and why it was a mistake to\ndouble cross him. They took that entity and made him the god damn terminator!!! Literally no risk to reward ratio. So\nthe pay out seems predictable. Stabbed 15 times and no possibility of injury, falls off ten foot ceiling and gets up\nwith no problem.\nJust an overall disappointing addition to the series and it seems like its taking the place of what the \"Die Hard\"\nseries once was, but it quickly follows that same train wreck.",

Last thing the villain was ok but for a 3 movie I felt it\nneeded a super bad ass villain.

    "reviewBody": "This universe, created without any source material, had to develop and expand itself in every new film. The same fiction\ncan not be made for each film. We dont know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first\ncreated it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.This film\noffers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of is included in the\nthird film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, there is even a\nhorse escape scene. Theres so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer.\nOnly action-oriented films can be considered empty. We can say that John Wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action for 2\nhours and 10 minutes. But in doing so, it doesnt forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of\nJohn Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe.Stahelski has very impressive shots.The main\nvenues preferred for the main fights were especially appreciated. The fact that the directors vision is so blended with\nKeanu Reeves and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Stahelski deserves great praise.The\nfilm also brings new characters. One of them is Sofia, played by Halle Berry. Obviously the audience will love Sofia.\nHalle Berry has done a great job. Mark Dacascos is one of our main villains; He portrayed the character Zero in the\nfilm.Among the action films, it was both a strong story and an ambitious way of action. I think that the action-lovers\nwill be pleasure separated from this film. 9/10",

    "reviewBody": "If you thought super-assassin, man of few words, dog fan and one man punching bag John Wick had run out of energy after\n2 weeks of carnage across John Wick and John Wick 2 then think again, as Wick (aka 54 year old Keanu Reeves) is back\nbigger, badder and madder than ever to wreak havoc across New York City (and the world) in the Hollywood action romp of\nthe year, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.Its incredible to think of where the Wick brand has come from, from the\nsurprising success of the first film that no one thought would be worth much of a look, through to the more excessive\nand large-scale 2nd installment that expanded the lore and universe that Wick is a part of, to now full-scale Hollywood\nbudget and flair, John Wick just keeps getting bigger and better.Re-teaming with stunt-man turned director Chad\nStahelski, Reeves and his directing partner have ensured that Parabellum (a title that will make sense once you watch\nthe film, trust me) is a film like no other with its completely over the top and highly unbelievable antics needing to\nbe seen to be believed and if my cinema experience is anything to go by, prepare to be wincing, laughing and clapping\nyour way through their gloriously energetic and thrill infused imaginations.With more headshots than a police database,\nmore devilishly entertaining acting turns from a returning main cast plus new additions such as Halle Berry (and some\nbloodthirsty canines), Angelica Huston, Sad Taghmaoui, Jerome Flynn and a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos and a collection\nof actions scenes that involve such things (as I kid you not) classic novels, underwater fights, motor cycle chases,\nshotgun rampages and horse riding through a busy New York street, there arent many films like John Wick or many that\ncould even dare to be it.Starting out much the same way as the 2nd installment in the franchise, Parabellum begins in\nbreathtaking fashion with its opening 20 - 30 minutes stanza some of the best your likely to see in 2019 and while its\nhard for the film to maintain this hyperactive energy over a two hour plus runtime, its great to see Stahelski and his\nleading man maintain a relatively consistent pacing throughout that despite some mid-section slow down, ensures that as\nit turns the corner into its endgame, we wont barely get a moments respite from the action delights coming our way.At\nthe end of the day everything that happens in Parabellum is unbelievable, silly and often outrageous but John Wick\nembraces this and runs with it, it knows what it is and is proud of it and this beautifully shot, carefully\nchoreographed and often thrilling exercise is the best example of a Hollywood action film your likely to get, with\nenough gas left in the tank to suggest that a 4th John Wick adventure is a more than an appealing proposition.Final Say\n-Once more anchored by a great Keanu Reeves turn and elevated by some incredible feats of action ballet, John Wick:\nChapter 3 - Parabellum is an absolute blast from start to finish that further solidifies John Wicks placing in the very\nbest action film franchises of all time.4 library books out of 5",

However, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy\nregarding its story and how it brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchises outstandingly\nchoreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.And its precisely the mind-blowing,\nbone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of\nthe most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking for something new to make the Oscars\nmore popular, and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better than\nBest Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible would become major successes at this award\nshow. These two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What you see,\nits what you get.Nowadays, viewers already have their eyes set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual\neffect. Ill never forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting out of the theater, a\ngroup of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of \"of course that scene is fake and this moment\nis CGI, how can you believe that?! Youre such a moron!\" They were roasting one of their friends, thinking he was the\ndumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people wont\nrealize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and\nauthentic stunts.Yes, its over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just to little details like\nbullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their\nknowledge of physics in a few particular moments. But thats the thing: if youre pumped to watch a third film of a\nfranchise, youre a fan. You know what its about and whats its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure\nrevenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale. John\nWick: Chapter Two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound\nby. Its a bit messier than the first one, but its still a blast of entertainment.Parabellum has the best of both\ninstallments. It has the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work\nIve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or\nemotionally justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and the cinematography plus the set\ndesign look stunning. I would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between\nlong action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward arent always smooth. Some comedy bits that I\ndont think they really belong in this saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really dont fit this\nworld.Besides that, I dont really have much to complain about. The cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is\nbattling with Tom Cruise for the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk by performing\nespecially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast, providing us with high-speed and\nhard-to-do fight sequences. Halle Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable of\nmoving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian\nMcShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofias dogs are deadly cute, and\nthey steal the show.Regarding the action stunts, theyre all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Twos mirror\nroom to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything Chad Stahelski and his\ntalented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect. I also love how the final act resembles the experience of\nplaying a videogame. You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective boss, but the final boss\nis at the top of them all? Its kind of like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in\neach floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be the must nonsensical analogy that\nI have, but its what my memory triggered. In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.All in all,\nJohn Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and\nbeautifully-choreographed fight sequences, accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins world.\nChad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or\nquick cuts here. Only extensive one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast. Keanu Reeves\nis one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better\ncontrol of its pacing and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been the best action movie\nof the century. \"One of the best\" its still one hell of a tagline.",

How badass is that? Ill tell you how much: ALL of the\nbadass.Parabellum begins the action almost immediately and doesnt let up. Even when it does slow down, it doesnt feel\nlike it, because it does a deep dive into Johns backstory; but since the filmmakers are masters of \"if you can show it,\ndont say it,\" even exposition  world building flows right along with the full throttle pacing of the rest of the\nmovie.Halle Berry steals the show, 100%. I want a full movie solely about her character, Sophia...no...I want a complete\ntrilogy. Shes so incredible in her action scenes, that she makes Johns feel almost boring. Shes just as good as John\nWick, but boiling over with ferocity, and with an added skill that trumps John completely.Asia Kate Dillons character,\nThe Adjudicator, is a force of nature; a storm that brings death  chaos everywhere they go. While they may not be a\nfighter, they are an insane villian thatd fit perfectly in a Batman movie.The action itself is filmed with such\nprecision, with long takes, that you feel like you accidentally walked directly into the mayhem. Its a sight to\nbehold.The John Wick universe is far from over, and I couldnt be happier.",

    "reviewTitle": "Really Good If Not Quite Great Wick Outing",
    "reviewBody": "Undoubtedly a big money franchise there is also something compelling about John Wick. Hes the most un-defeattable\nunderdog Ive ever seen. Sorry Luke Skywalker. We dont really know what his power source is unlike you. So in the third\ninstallment we pick up with Wick being marked for deletion with a huge bounty by that mondo organization whose thing is\nrobot-like loyalty.It doesnt take long for the action to begin as it should since this isnt \"On Golden Pond\". And when\nit begins it just keeps coming. This is playing a bit to lowest common denominator because its the scenes in between\nwhere this film really is interesting. The characters of Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne, Lance Reddick,\nand Angelica Huston make the story rise above the fights which honestly are so plentiful and well staged they kind of\nget lost after a while. Then theres two special characters that doll out the ominous decisions from which everything\nkind of springs forth. They are \"the adjudicator\" and \"the elder\". The elder, though interesting is milk toast compared\nto the imposing adjudicator played by Asia Dillon. You kind of hang on and hope for the up-commence of her character as\nshe imposes the rules and regulations of fealty with evil impunity. This is a good performance.Im tiring of the fights\nalthough I must say it hasnt been done better and the motorcycle scenes are truly over-the -top. Its all a big video\ngame like to a kind of generic middle-ground Sci-Fi/drama thing. Still impressive. But past all of the action its the\ncharacter who make John Wick still a thing. In spite of the technical prowess Im pretty much just in for the characters\nand the fact Wick seems to be unable to die. We are hit squarely with an ending that promises another installment. I do\nrecommend this but I want more of the character and story in the next one please - because I know Ill get the action as\nthat is a given.",

Someone appears to have\nforgotten to write a storyline except hes on the run with a 14M bounty on his head and has to kill as many people as\npossible in as many different ways.Ive had a cinema unlimited card for the past 2 years and seen about 130 films\n(normally 5/6 a month) and Ive seen some rubbish in those 130, but nothing quite as bad as this and I reckon it will be\na while till I see something as bad again.Even Halle Berry and Ian McShane couldnt save this one.",

    "reviewBody": "A few minutes after the movie began, John is in a narrow hall full of antiques fighting an infinite amount of people and\nthrowing antique knives. The scene is so kinetic that raise your adrenaline level and keep you holding your breath (quit\ndifficult thing because on top of the ultra violence, the scene became darkly funny and force you to laugh). This is\njust one scene of the many action pieces this movie has. It is not the most spectacular but is going to blow your mind\nand body. Do not expect to find anything remotely close on a Marvel/Disney movie. This is really excellent action, play\nby real actors not the boring and (really bad) digital fights on the Avengers movies.\nAs much action and violence this movie has (which is more than all this years movies combined) the script department\nwas a bit disappointing. I was really expecting a little more development. I am glad anyway they leave it open for\nChapters 4; but I comes faster than Chapter 3.\nIn terms of acting; Keanu, Ian McShane,Lance Reddick, Fishburne deliver their characters with great charisma and wit.\nHalle Berry is always excellent as an action star and I hope her character comes back. Marc Dacascos still has the moves\nbut deserves a better written character. But the stunts and doubles are the best ; they really deserve Oscars even when\ntheir faces are rarely shown.\nIn brief; minimu story (which basically was the norm this year with most of the blockbusters), but extremely well\ncrafted cinematography and action scenes with a bit of fun.",

It makes for a highly enjoyable world that we want to spend more time in, and\nlearn more about. Thats the true brilliance of this franchise. To just have John killing off people, with no real\nmeaning, would get old fast. But by constantly expanding this heightened reality, we cant help but get drawn deeper and\ndeeper into this Wonderland, tumbling down a rabbit hole, waiting to see where it all goes.

Check.\nOne-dimensional characters with clear motives? Done.\nAction? Check.\nMore action. Check.\nA love interest who gets only enough screen time to humanise our unstoppable. revenge/justice seeking, death machine?\nCheck.\nAnything else? More action.\nIf the above list doesnt appeal -- Then dont watch John Wick. There are plenty of other films out there.\nIf you want depth, character development and story-telling then read a good book, its a better medium for it and they\nbog down the pace of a good action film where pacing is more important than depth, choreography is more important than\ncharacter development and the story is only used to get the hero from one set-piece to the next.\nParabellum is a relentless, switch-off your brain and have fun film. Its ridiculous in the best ways, loud and violent\nfrom start to finish and I enjoyed it immensely.\nIf you havent seen the first two, Id recommend catching up before watching the newest instalment but Im fairly\nconfident newcomers to the series will pick up whats going on, or they wont, I dont think its integral to revel in\nthe majesty that is John Wick.\nIf youve ever watched Commando or The Running Man and thought to yourself They dont make films like that\nanymore, I can assure you...\nThey do.",

    "reviewTitle": "A \"Threequel\" With Extraordinarily Choreographed Action",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick is back, and the third film in the franchise combines impressive action and world-building to create a unique\nblend of neo-noir thrills that fans of this series will probably really enjoy. \"John Wick: Chapter 3--Parabellum\" is not\nwithout its imperfections, but the film has much to like about it. The film picks up pretty much just after where the\nsecond film left off, as Wick is about to be designated \"excommunicado\" with a $14 million bounty on his head for\nkilling someone in a Continental Hotel near the end of the second film, which is strictly prohibited if blood is spilled\nin the hotel. This film contains incredibly impressive and visceral action scenes that incorporate all types of action\ntechniques, from bare-knuckle fights to gun-fu to motorcycle chasing and more. The action is so intense that you will\nleave the theater a bit exhausted (in a good way,) and the last time I felt that way after watching a movie was back\nwhen I saw \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" in theaters four years ago. Thankfully, the films trailers dont spoil much of the best\naction that the film has to offer. The sheer stylization and choreography of all the action is truly astonishing, as is\nthe films inspirations that manage to span the globe--which include traditional Russian ballet all the way to \"The\nRaid\"-style fight sequences from Indonesian cinema.Also impressive in the film is the sense of world-building present,\nas the mythology of what its like to be an assassin in the \"John Wick\" universe is fleshed out here in far more detail.\nThe scenes set inside the Continental are stunningly shot and lit, and helps provide context surrounding the action that\nwe see. Occasionally, the films narrative can almost be too reliant on its action sequences. This is not a huge burden\non the film given just how impressive the action is, but it still does work to the actual plot lines detriment in some\nway. The other criticism I have of the film is that it could have used dialogue to further develop the characters and\nplot more. While the \"John Wick\" films have always been known for primarily focusing on action over dialogue, the\nwriting that exists in the film is often somewhat redundant in nature when you consider that key plot details spoken in\nthe films dialogue are often clearly conveyed during one of the many action scenes. That said, those who enjoy this\nfranchise will certainly get a genuine thrill out of watching this film on the big screen. 7.5/10",

It was stylish, cool, and had an air of ambiguity about the world John used to be\na part of. The characters were fantastic, despite not fully knowing about them.The second one was a bit of a let down\noverall. It had some decent action, but the drive behind the movie that the first had was lost and I didnt care for it\nfrom a storytelling perspective. But it was still enjoyable from a non-stop action standpoint. The story with John owing\nthat guy a favor really wasnt as intriguing as the firsts set-up of the universe. The 2nd almost showed too much of\ntheir secret world.I wasnt as interested to see the third after the previous one wasnt as compelling. But I figured\nId see John Wick to the end anyways.This one is definitely a step up from the second movie, but it still lacking the\nnarrative to make it fully compelling. Sure, these movies ARENT going to be a storytelling masterpiece. These movies\nare about the practical action and pretty much that.The story in this one is essentially John is on the run after\nbreaking the a cardinal rule of the assassin world. He goes to various people from his past to get help, but in the\nbackground a messenger from the controlling board of the assassins visits each person who helped John throughout the\npast movie. Its a compelling enough story to help showcase the amazing action scenes, but its not as interesting as\nthe first movie was.There is a lull in the middle where John goes to the desert to find a special person that just\nseemed so unneeded. They could have cut that out and made the movie a bit more compact. Especially when he agrees to\nsomething, then literally goes back on the agreement 10 minutes later.This movie is about the action set pieces and it\nexcels in those. Many of them I still have no idea how they did them. It is a masterpiece when it comes to that aspect.\nSome of the fist fight scenes do feel like they go on a little too long, especially one towards the end with a duo of\nAsian actors.Most of the fights you have to leave realism outside before watching them, but theyre still really\nentertaining in the long run.JW3 continues the streak of having some of the best movie action ever filmed, so see it on\nthat merit. I still think that JW1 is still the best overall as it has a much more compelling plot and better set of\ncharacters.",

Yea, story or Keanu as an actor arent the gold\nmasterpiece of acting/writing (personally i dont like how Keanu is speaking, how he interacts with people - he is fair\nbut he isnt so much enjoyable in dialogues. But i love Keanu as a human being). But the WHOLE movie is absolutely\nstaggering. This series is destroying every boundaries and its obvious this is Stahelskis lifetime project. He became an\nabsolute supremo of so called \"Modern B action flick\". Stahelski isnt boring, isnt cheap. He thinks, he brainstorms, he\nWANTS YOU TO HAVE FUN. Parrabelum is SO MANY MILE AHEAD from the second chapter. As expected , deeper background of\nEVERYTHING (backstory of Wick himself, High Table, universe expansion).\nChapter 2 was the worst from this trilogy, third part is the best because is not so linear , predictable and\nnon-enjoyable (for multiple viewings) as second or first part. Technically, its the best action movie ever since Matrix\n(in way of inventive elements.)\nMUST SEE..",

    "reviewBody": "I have mixed feelings about this third installment. What works in films favour are breathtaking action sequences,\nespecially a scene in a horses stable and on a bridge (overpass) with Wick fighting off bikers. It is expertly directed\nand edited. John Wick is still as mean as ever. What doesnt work in films favour is the following: nonexistent script\nor a poor attempt of a story and the fact that it doesnt end as a trilogy. There is a scene that I wouldve made\ndifferently, when Wick is in a desert looking for a way out, in that particular moment he would start hallucinating\nbecause of dehydration, be under illusion of seeing his dead wife Helen, looking gently at him and as soon as hed reach\nhis hand towards her, shed disappear. When this film first came out, a sequel was obvious and expected. I have been\nlooking forward to seeing this third chapter for a long time and now after watching it, I only hope for a better\ndeveloped screenplay and characterisation in a fourth chapter. Until then tick-tack.",

    "reviewTitle": "Its Not A Masterpiece, But Keanu Is Masterful In this Role",
    "reviewBody": "The John Wick franchise, like Fast and the Furious is one of those franchises you have to grade on the quality of the\naction rather than the quality of its story. Neither of the first two John Wick films had a remarkable story, so the\nJohn Wick experience is really about enjoying one of the greatest action stars of his generation doing what he does best\nin the most creative of ways--killing bad guys. Killing lots of them.For the third installment in the John Wick\nfranchise, Keanu Reeves and Halle Berry guarantee you will not survive any drinking game based on their characters\nkill counts. If you thought John Wick killed a lot of people in the first two movies, then youre going to need a\ncalculator for this gun-fu ode to Bruce Lees Game of Death. Keanu continues to master the art of injury-limping through\nhis films and finding the energy necessary to eviscerate one guy after the next. Hes done it so much throughout his\ncareer that you sometimes fail to appreciate how talented he is as a real action star during some of his scenes--you\nexpect it. Thats not a knock on him, thats a tribute to how good Keanu is at these types of roles.What was a surprise\nwas Halle Berrys fantastic sequence of kills that looked like the spawning of her own franchise with the intensity and\nlength of her fight sequence. Anyone whos ever tried to collect alimony from Halle Berry should seriously try to\nreimburse her after seeing this. She was gloriously vicious in this movie.The opening scenes kill in the library was\nwithout a doubt, the movie bad guy kill of the year in a movie full of award-winning fatalities (if there were such a\nthing). Its a franchise brimming over with mind-numbing violence that still finds ways to always make you squeamish.One\nof two problems with John Wick 3 is the organizational structure of the fight scenes. You expect a movie to open strong,\nsettle down, and build to a crescendo. Unfortunately, some of the best fights happen earlier in the film, leaving the\nending fight filling a bit anti-climatic. The other is a lost opportunity to use to more moments of humor to liven up a\nmovie that occasionally becomes so repetitive that youre just waiting for it to end. One of my favorite scenes from the\nfirst John Wick film was John killing multiple guys in his home and having the police stop by and totally ignore it like\nit was just another day in this neighborhood. Moments of levity mixed with action are the hallmarks of this franchise.\nThis movie gets it half right and thats not an entirely bad thing, because the other half is what John Wick fans came\nfor--Keanu Reeves reminding you that he is the best action star in the world.",

    "reviewBody": "The man. The myth. The legend. Will somebody please, get this man a: pistol, shotgun, throwing knife, belt, sword, book,\nmotorcycle and a horse. Because in a year of lacklustre releases, John Wick has come to save the day yet again. Oh yes!\nBeing declared \"excommunicado\" results in a barrage of relentless well-choreographed action sequences that rivals its\npredecessors and action milestones such as The Raid 2, whilst also providing an in depth exploration of the assassin\nworld that he resides in. Stahelskis franchise, from a revenge thriller to action extravaganza, has progressed\nsubstantially. For the better, might I add. Immediately after the events of the second film, John Wick is on the run\nfrom an endless wave of assassins after a ludicrously rewarding contract is put on his head.He has overcome vengeance,\nbroken the rules of The Continental and is now succumbing to desperation. The clock is ticking. The assassins are\npreparing. Ready yourself for one of the best first acts this year (or any year for that matter!). Stahelski immediately\ninjects his neo-noir aesthetic within the immediate second of John Wick running for his life. Vivid neon lights\nrefracting from the harsh rainfall. The suspicious activity of passersby. Six oclock hits. Showtime! The sheer ferocity\nof violence welcomes Mr. Wick as he is sublimely throwing daggers into skulls, destroying a jaw with just a book and\npolitely using a horse to kick the absolute excrement out of others. Ooh. Aah. Ouch!Stahelskis signature eye for stunt\nwork is unparalleled. Exhilarating long takes showcasing Reeves physical prowess as he throws himself into every\nexciting sequence. Utilising various different pieces of equipment to inventively slay the opposition. An absurd amount\nof bone-crunching, skull-mashing and eye-popping that is enhanced due to the brilliant sound effects team. Even the\ngunshots made me clinch my chest, fooling me into thinking a bullet penetrated my heart. A refreshing sequence involving\nBerrys Sofia, an assassin who must help Wick, proves that Stahelski can balance multiple characters in the same action\nsequence. This also includes two vicious dogs that tear the enemy apart. A symphony of violence, where every component\ncomes together perfectly.Both Reeves and Berry give physically demanding performances, with the former looking exhausted\nby the third act (a subtle detail I really appreciated), whilst also presenting a nuanced set of emotions. We all know\nReeves is no Day-Lewis, and the writers avoid the sentimental moments for a more angered approach instead, working in\nhis favour. A plethora of other characters, ranging from assassins to members of the High Table, are well introduced and\nremained memorable throughout.Is the third instalment perfect? Unfortunately not. Naturally in an action film, there are\ndown times where the story simmers and allows the audience to catch a breath. These moments lulled too much in my\nopinion, considering the extensive runtime, and shouldve been shortened to keep the pace tighter. A sequence involving\nJohn Wick traversing a desert seemingly paused the film for a somewhat unusual part of the story that felt out of place.\nThen theres the ending. Youre either on board with it or not, especially the plausibility of a certain fall. For me,\nIm more inclined to tilt towards the former but understandably it will divide viewers. Occasionally the CGI can be\nnoticeable, and will take you out of the action for the minuscule of seconds. However admittedly Im nitpicking\nhere.John Wick has to be one of the most consistent franchises available. Each instalment attempts to increase the\ncarnage and stunt work. And it works. Whilst the lengthy runtime is questionable in places, Stahelskis third chapter is\ndefinitely \"preparing for war\" and I cannot wait to see how the story progresses. Reeves is the man. But John Wick is\nthe hero!",

I loved this movie!\nThe editing along with the stylistic screenplay tailored to what makes a Keanu movie \"Keanuesque\" which makes his fans\nenjoy his movies is a formula, I believe, has been thoroughly perfected by the John Wick Franchise. Special praise here\nfor Derek Kolstad who wrote the screenplay (I believe with two other writers?). What may be well known is that Kolstad\nwrote the script for John Wick (little trivia: the title character is named after Kolstads grandfather, which Keanu\nsuggested) The choreography of the fight sequences - man! Keanu nails it. Even though most look like straight out of\ngraphic novels, its polished and sharp. I was so glad to see Halle Berry (its been a while since I last saw her in a\nmovie) but man! Shes still got it in her! Just like Keanu, Halle too appears ageless!! Shes superb and amazing in this\nmovie - loved her action sequences. Keanu was a revelation! He carries off that detached wryness with a zen-like poise\nthats his trademark signature with an unmistakably effortless style. I personally feel John Wick 3 is the best in the\nseries, I liked it more than the previous two. So for which, I feel this movie definitely deserves a full ten stars!!",

I will say this as, I hated it when in a fight the guy(s) can kill John they stop and\ngive him another chance to kill them (not die) it happens several times. I also hated that at one point John basically\nbegs for his life - John bows to no man who threatens him. In the first two movies the fights are exaggerated but have a\nstrong sense of realism to them (thats what makes them awesome), this movie (in the end fights) begins to slide towards\nthe ridiculous. I think this franchise shouldve ended here, got a real feeling the writers are trying to squeeze out\nmore than they should from this storyline.

The movie moved along quickly. The story was there but it was barely\nholding everything together. Mainly this movie was about great shootouts, and fight choreography, mixed in with small\nmoments of dialogue to keep the party going.\nThe shootouts were great! The fight choreography was also great... in the beginning. Then something happened halfway\nthrough where it felt like the fight choreography was happening in slow motion. It was very noticeable, to the point\nwhere the fighting was starting to get predictable. What I mean by that is that the fights started to become less fluid.\nIn Jackie Chans films everything is high speed, tight, and fluid. Here it felt a little clunky, as if the actors were\nwaiting to get punched or thrown.\nOne of the strong points of this movie were its sets. Every set was full of color, and detail. What I mean by detail is\nthat every theme looked just right. If you take a moment to look at all of the objects on set, or the buildings,\neverything looked like it belonged. It was perfect no matter what location John Wick was. One second, its dark and\nseedy, then next the screen is filled with bright and warm colors. They did a great job creating themes based on the\nlocations.\nSo, should you watch it or skip it? If you like action movies with crazy shootouts and fights, little to no story line\nthen Id say WATCH IT! This movie is definitely for you. I give it a solid 7/10. Would I buy it? nah. Would I rent it to\nsee it again? Definitely.",

Would have been 9/10 if not for some\npretty big inconsistencies in Continental providing amnesty to John (unresolved, there are aways... consequences... but\nwe dont find out), and the one other criticism is the motives of the combatants in the drawn out final fight is\nextremely unclear.

Keanu\ndeserves a ton of praise for the success of the movie as his physical dedication to the character is turned up to 11 for\nthis movie.Halle Berry gets to show off all her training even if she plays a smaller role than I would have thought. The\ncinmetography is surprisingly great. Overall this movie is 9/10 and my rating scale does not cross genres, so as an\naction movie this is a close to perfect as you can get. My only complaint is the ending but I wont spoil it here. So if\nyou like the first two you will love this, so sit back for 2 hours of beautiful mayhem.",

    "reviewTitle": "Parabellum : Reviewed",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick 3 Parabellum : Reviewed\nThere is something helplessly alluring about the way Keanu Reeves moves while fighting. He is not very fast like the\ntraditional Asian martial artists; yet he is just so un-friggin-believable. And thats what the whole John Wick\nfranchise rests upon so heavily; Crazy and impeccably well choreographed fight sequences (Which is like a symphony of\nsorts for a martial artist buff like me) and Keanu performing them. Like a breeze.\nThe 3rd installment of the Baba Yaga (John Wick) universe titled Parabellum (simply means Prepare for War) takes us a\nlittle deeper into the world of assassins and the High table (The global underworld) which was touched upon in the 2nd\npart. The movie begins right where the 2nd film wrapped up. John wick is the most wanted Man in the world with a booty\nof 14 Mn USD on his life. And he evades that. He kills his way through countless number of master assassins to stay\nalive. The body, blade and bullet count here will drive you nuts.\nThe world of the continental and the High table gets a lot more alluring with the addition of a few more characters and\nlocations. We are introduced to The elder one who is above the High Table who has his base in the deserts of Morocco.\nThen there is an adjudicator. Well, who adjudicates. And we are introduced to a manager of the Continental Morocco\n(Halle Berry, Sophia). That apart from the old characters. The Dog. Winston and ofcourse, the Doctor.\nParabellum goes all Guns blazing with its extreme action choreography; something Chad Stahelski loves to do. The\nwriting is crisp keeping in mind the subtle humour and minimal dialogue for Mr. Wick.\nThere are horses, dogs, bikes, swords, knives and ofcourse, armour piercing shot gun rounds. Several East Asian guys are\nadded to the mix to offer us mouth watering and awe inspiring fight sequences. And Mr. Wick kicks ass. You cant help\nbut go bonkers about Keanu Reeves.\nThis is also a reunion of sorts for The Matrix team.\nThe climax is deliciously twisted to keep everyone guessing.\nAs the movie comes to an end, the words of Mr. Wick from the 2nd film keep lingering around; Tell them. Tell them all.\nI will kill them all.\npsk",

The acting is\ngood, the writing is mediocre (it serves just one purpose - to drive the action scenes of the movie, nothing more). The\nflaws of the movie, however, are greatly compensated by the great overall technical execution of the film.\nIt seems that Lionsgate decided to turn this franchise with its main character into a cash-cow, postponing the\nconclusion of John Wicks story-arc for the future films, which is not a bad thing if they manage to keep the quality at\nthis level.",

    "reviewBody": "Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because its\nnot in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker\ncomedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded\nfor the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its\nset up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic\nbook film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but its serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the\nworld if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves hes a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and\nvibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.",

    "reviewTitle": "Anorexic Weak Mess",
    "reviewBody": "By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. Its hard to determine, but\nmaybe \"Morbius\" won the prize for the weakest film in SSU (Sonys Universe) and honestly it does with ease.Leto is\n\"okay\" in the role of Michael Morbius, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. Matt Smith is the\none who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90%\nsimilar to the previous two \"Venom\" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.The effects are pretty...how to say\nit...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Lets not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in\n2020, initially before \"No Way Home\". However, Im not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra\n2 years time, because...well Ill leave that to you.The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to\nunderstand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, dont expect too much, because youll\nbe disappointed.Morbius is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly.\nUnfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the \"Venom\"\nmovies. Honestly, I dont have high hopes for neither \"Kraven\" or \"Madame Web\". The standard is pretty low.The film is\nmediocre and feels like something straight from 2006, with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some\ndollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.I can say that the best...or rather the stupidest they have left for the end.\nI mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.",

    "reviewBody": "Its pretty rare for me to see superhero movies with a great logical explanation for their superpower through sci-fi.\nThis Morbius (2022) has a lil bit blown my mind with their scientific explanation and great delivery which is convincing\nenough to think if Morbiuss superpower is possibly happening. One of the Greatest Scientists and a Nobel Prize\nRepellent, Dr. Michael Morbius struggle to find the cure for his incurable disease for his fellow sufferer. Then, he has\nfound the cure through bat vampire blood with great superhuman power but costing uncontrollable body and mind. Long\nstory short, this movie is about the introduction of Morbiuss superpower and most of the storyline is about controlling\nhis superpower.The pros are suitable pace which is not too fast or too slow, great logical explanation through a Lil bit\nof sci-fi, and a clear storyline through simple story explanation. My odd POV, I thought this movie a lil bit reminded\nme about the chars from The Twilight Saga, especially The Volturi. The Volturi char seems to have a similar appearance\nto Morbius through the same haircut and vampire ambiance lol. The cons are incomparable to other superhero movies and\nstandard quality for overall including visual, ex: CGI. This movie didnt about a superhero typical plot in which\nsuperheroes fight the villain from a threatening world. It even didnt about fighting a very difficult or a very strong\nvillain which makes this movie didnt qualify enough as a superhero movie. But both of that reason is typical of Sony\nSpider-Man Universe like Venom movies. This is also the main reason why Morbius has been made to synchronize with\nSpider-Man, Venom, and upcoming movie through the different universes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) which\nconsist of the Avengers.Overall, this movie is just good and okay. Its worth it if didnt expect any expectations of a\nsuperhero movie. Maybe it felt like Venom movies but tbh Id rather choose Venom lol. Lastly, there are two post-credit\nand pretty important if wondered how the universe collides with the Spider-Man.",

For CGI, They did great things\nfor the fighting scenes but for special effects on actors faces looks basic. I quite love the scores, especially Michael\nMorbiuss theme. Rating is also big influence for some scenes in this movie. With PG-13, some scenes seems lost lot of\natmosphere. Morbius should be depicted as scary and sadistic. In this movie, he depicted as less than in the comic. As\nhappened in the previous two Venom movies.Overall this movie is \"light\" and just an filler movie for another Sonys big\nproject in the future. I dont know what they plan next but Morbius is part of their plan. Lets hope Sony learns\nsomething and fix its for their next movies. Im not recommend this movies but if you are fan of Morbius and Sony\nCinematic Universe, you can watch it.",

And\nweve now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). Im BEGGING the movie studios to\nhave the courage to go all out.But thats far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as\na PG-13 movie. So why didnt I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup\nfor me. It didnt even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a\ncomplete mess. Its poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is\nbarely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome,\nentertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: \"The action was gibberish.\" You couldnt see anything.I really tried\nto like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And\nthe climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and\nthe visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots\nare visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side\nuniverse has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of\nmaking great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits\nscenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony\nMarvel universe. I cant come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to\ntheir universe of origin. But for the Vulture, thats the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this\nsuper weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesnt flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He\nseems to be \"a good guy,\" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that theyre not know to be a\nvillain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesnt feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us\nwith the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the\nfans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have\nto ask, what were they thinking?",

    "reviewTitle": "two of us against many",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who\nhas devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born\nwith. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film\nis directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who\npreviously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past\nwork tells you what you need to know.An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around\nthe water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire\nbats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure.\nAll of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their\ndeteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN\nFANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr.\nNikolis (Jared Harris, \"Mad Men\").Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as \"The Living\nVampire\", so we kinda know where things are headed. Its a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his\ncharacterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and\nMorbius love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). Youve probably guessed\nthat the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI\nagents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to\nthe high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and its the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the\nhey, I like this superhuman power Milo.The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the\nstory, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst\nspecial effects Ive seen in years. Sure, the films release has been delayed a couple of years, but thats no excuse\nfor what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his\nscenes. We do wish for more of Martines story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of\nthe SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. Its clear this films\nmission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I\nwouldnt mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY\nHOME, I believe its fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication\nwhere the sequel is headed.Opening in theaters April 1, 2022.",

Milo (Matt Smith) first met twenty five years ago in a\nhospital where they were both being treated for a rare blood disease. Their doctor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) noted\nMichaels exceptional intellect and sent him off for further studies. Presently, Michael has become a brilliant doctor\nand scientist who had been able to develop life-saving artificial blood which earned him a Nobel Prize.Working on the\nanti-thrombotic elements of the saliva of vampire bats he had collected from Costa Rica, Michael invented a drug which\ncould cure the affliction he (and Milo) suffered from. However, because human trials were illegal for such substances,\nhe conspired with his girlfriend Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to inject the serum into him on a ship on\ninternational waters. The terrifying effects were not what they were expecting.Morbius was a character from Marvel\nComics that I had no idea about. This was a Sony release, like the original Spider-Man and adjacent characters like\nVenom and Carnage, and so it wont be directly connected with main Marvel Cinematic Universe which is under Disney.\nThere is controversy among fans how Sony was confusing the story arc of the MCU, like seeing Tom Hollands Spider-Man in\nthe closing credits of \"Venom.\"Being his origin story, we see how Morbius met his best friend and blood brother Milo,\nand how his bold experiments had brought their friendship into the next level. Jared Leto played Morbius all moody,\nbroody, and mired in his moral predicament, in sharp contrast with Matt Smith (best known as the 11th incarnation of the\nDoctor in \"Doctor Who\" and Prince Philip in \"The Crown\") who played Milo all loud, gleeful and manic.Aside from the\nvampiric transformations, CG effects ranged from subtle (like his ear wiggling for echolocation) to bombastic (like his\nhigh-speed wave forms tinged with bright colors from his clothing). Director Daniel Espinosa effectively created an\natmosphere of dread and horror, but kept things within a PG rating. A character last seen in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\"\nappeared in the closing credits scenes hinting a Multiverse connection. 6/10.",

The formation of the latter was hinted at in the mid credit scenes of Morbius. While there\nclearly seems to have been some production/editing/delay issues, it didnt feel like a soulless cash grab, at least to\nme. There does seem to be a larger payoff thats being built towards, which is cool. Now that a larger Spider-Man story\nhas been alluded to, the interconnectedness of the movies will drive Spider-Man fans to see every release regardless of\nthe criticism, similar to the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Why we still give any credit to Sony Universe?",
    "reviewBody": "This film might have been considered interesting sometime in the beginning of this century, but now its nothing more\nthan a basic superhero plot with no intrigue whatsoever.So what we are dealing with?1) Main charachters goals and\nmotivationDr. Morbius is a genius of his generation, whose goal (at least on paper) is to cure himself and his friend\nfrom a disease that involves constant supply of blood. He finds a cure, but it comes with some drawbacks. Basically the\ndoctor will now have to kill to stay alive. I believe this was a basic promise for this movie. However when we first see\nJared Leto I cant help but think, that he was an awful idea for this role. His character doesnt show any regard for\nhuman life and if he has to deal with life-or-death situation he seems to save lives out of necessity and not because of\nhis moral principles. Thats why when he finally has to kill (at the end of the second act) I dont get any emotional\nfeedback for his deed. Usually this kind of action shows us how far has the main hero fallen and why they should be\nconsidered an antihero, e.g. Remember how unconcerned Lou was when Rick was killed (Nightcrawler).2) Interaction between\ncharacters.In the second scene of the movie two of our main characters meet each other and the \"eternal\" friendship\nbegins. The only act of care for each other happens exactly in this scene, when Morbius saves Loxiass life due to\nmorbiuss unprecedented genius. After that we dont get nearly any scene that shows Matt Smith and Jared Leto being\nfriends. Why you ask? Because movie doesnt have time for this. A few moments later Matt Smiths character already\nbecomes the bad guy and well is now to be stopped.Basically the same transpires between Morbius and other side\ncharacters. Theres no chemistry between any of them.3) And finally the awful third act consisting of a lot of CGI mess\nand some questionable decisions by the main antihero. This finale is so basic so I cant even be bothered to describe\nit, you have seen it some many times already, so you know whats going to happen before it all even begins.Epilogue: a\nfew years ago this movie might have been considered \"quite good\", but for 2022 its an awful movie that thankfully will\nfail at the box office.4/10\nJared Leto wont be appearing in any cinematic universe soon P. S. I think the only way to pull you to the cinemas to\nwatch the movie may be Michael Keatons appearance. However it happens only in the after-credit scenes and remains\nambiguous.",

    "reviewTitle": "A profoundly bad movie. Sony is 100% guilty of false advertising. Early review.",
    "reviewBody": "This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then\nskip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and\nadvertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood\ndisease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go\nhead first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared\nover the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this\nfilm. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive\nmeddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a\ndisaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men\nOrigins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. Its just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I dont know if the\ndirector, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief\nof Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous\nproduction that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.",

    "reviewTitle": "Overdone CGI and editing aside- I enjoyed this one",
    "reviewBody": "Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite\nmany little flaws. Ill start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI.\nI know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as\nfitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have\nbeen rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and\nviolence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a\nman acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot\nof films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry\nMorbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced\nfor comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony\nwould have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office\ngross. I know ive complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure\nits messy, Matt Smiths character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very\nentertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that\nare interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to\ncontrol himself. Theres a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic\nmoments, theres a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with\nthe films story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid\nsuperhero endeavor and Im curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "A toothless and inept Marvel offering",
    "reviewBody": "Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvels\ncollaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was\ndoomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to\nsay that the world wouldve been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from\ndirector Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand\ncasts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the\nMarvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI,\namateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that cant come to an\nend quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michaels entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene,\nan unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, its hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its\npotentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role\nthat begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is\nnothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story thats hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out\nof the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does theres snippets of what might have been found\nwithin them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but thats not the case with Espinosa and Letos\nblockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the\nonly slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smiths villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout\nmost of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone\nelse is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by\nSony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how\nanyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest\nmovie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for\nLetos charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite\npossibly the worst Marvel film weve yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even\nthe most pessimistic of pundits couldve expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without\npurpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden\naway slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

Maybe people have something against him? Maybe he did something bad that I dont know about and got \"canceled\"?\nIn any case, the fact stands: hes a really good actor.Watch Morbius without reading too many reviews and make up YOUR\nmind.

I will think about this film for the rest of my life, and will watch it again and again. Move\nover batman, move over every other film that we all thought was the greatest film ever, all the films throughout the\nyears that you think aew excellent, and classics, forget it mate! This is what cinema is, this is what an amazing\nflawless remarkable piece of art looks like! Yes! Go see this absolute outstanding, totally insane fun rollarcoaster\nride of delight!! If theres one thing we live behind that years and years later someone goes \"we did something right!\"\nitll be this gem.",

    "reviewBody": "I saw the film today and I really liked it: serious, introspective and with quite serious themes (such as the condition\nof those who suffer from serious illnesses and are constantly forced to care, I have two relatives in these conditions\nand I have particularly empathized with both protagonist than with the villain).I found the characters well placed in\nthe roles, from Jared Leto, to Matt Smith (very good), but also Adria Arjona and Jared Harris, maybe Tyrese Gibson and\nAl Madrigal a little lower.I liked the effect of the view amplified by the echolocation (hence the trails that are seen)\nand also the physics of the vectors used by Morbius to fly (it is not really a real flight, but a gliding on the\nupdrafts).Quite coherent plot and discreetly (although not entirely) faithful to the origins of the character.For me the\nonly reason for the low rating is that everyone who gives it to this film expected to see Spiderman (sorry, but the\ntitle of the film is Morbius and therefore we talk about him), or who hates Sony regardless.Recommended movie.",

    "reviewBody": "Morbius was by no means any masterpiece. It was pretty forgettable over all, especially the action sequences, which\nisnt a good sign for an action movie, and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few\ncharacters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships, and then it just kinda\nended without me being ready for it.That said I was never really bored in the theatre. It was an interesting enough\npremise, I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout. None of these actors are gonna win\nany Oscars for their work on this movie, but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance. Over all an OK\nnight at the theatre and I would rather re-watch this than anything Disney/Marvel had put out post Far from home, except\nNo Way Home, and even that isnt super good IMO, its just special to watch because of all the returning actors. Try to\npitch that movie but have every returning character from the other universes be played by different people youd end up\nwith something properly stupid.",

I think\npeople are so use to the Jokes after jokes after jokes these new marvel/Disney movies they have been producing where\nevery marvel character is funny. So when you see a darker toned movie from them thats not family friendly people dont\nlike it. I think the pacing was good I was tuned in. Its also the fact Hes not a big name like Spiderman/Thor. However\nfor a standalone movie it wasnt bad, but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos\nof others like blade etc. Or they should of had him introduced into someone elses movie first like how Black Panther\nwas introduced in the avengers movies. I think you should see it for yourself everybody has their own taste. I like the\ndarker side of Marvel like Blade, Spawn, Ghost Rider, Punisher etc.",

This film doesnt seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding\namazing film, it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that its building up to something bigger.\nMy opinion would be ignore the critics, go watch the film yourself, watch the to mid-credit scenes and make up your own\nmind.",

Eye\nrolling even.It wasnt the worst film Ive ever seen, but it was super underwhelming and lazily crammed together.I\ncouldnt say Id ever tell someone they need to go see this, out of fear theyd want to strangle me. LolIf I didnt have\nan affinity for the character from reading comics my whole life, I think i would have absolutely hated it but that love\ngot me through it.I wish I had better things to say, but its a pretty mediocre film that deserved to be better. Leto\ndeserves it to be better as well.The end credits stuff is more entertaining than the actual film. At least they left me\nwith something.Kinda bummed.",

The chemistry between Leto and Smith was nice to see but I just wish their characters were more fleshed out as\nthere is so much lacking in their development. The cinematography was really nice and the overall plot was predictable\nbut not the worst Ive seen on the other hand the cgi in this film is awful and completely stopped me from being able to\nfully submerge in the story. This film had some strong potential for a newcomer in the Sony cinematic franchise but just\nultimate falls short. The other main issue is the writing; most characters just make stupid decisions such as the\ndetectives and its hard to watch whilst trying to suspend disbelief. It doesnt deserve the current rating of 4.6 as\nbelieve me Ive seen much worse films but it just doesnt hold up compared to the other films in Sonys world.",

But I still walked in with an optimistic mindset.Wow was\nI proven right to be hesitant. This must be one of the worst superhero movies put to screen and one of the worst\ncinematic experiences Ive sat through in a very long time.This movie from the first 10 minutes immediately felt off,\nscenes jumped from moment to moment without much context in-between. Each scene felt separate from one another and the\nlacked much connection or through line. Which doesnt help this already thin excuse of a plot as Morbius checks all the\ntypical boxes as it tells a story about the generic science experiment gone wrong, to a man who deals with (insert\nmedical condition), who must learn to control his powers and fight a villain with the same powers.The acting from all\nthe cast felt bored and sloppy, the only actor who was putting in any work was Matt Smith who saved as many scenes as he\ncould as he looked as if he was having the most fun during this film.The CGI was laughably bad, looking like an early\n2000s movies and the third act left me looking at the screen and audibly ask \"Is that it?\"Dont waste your money on\nthis movie, wait till it inevitably ends up on one of the numerous streaming services available and instead go and see\nThe Batman again.",

In his universe hes more darker and has\na stronger connection to life and people losing control of there powers . I bet he knew something about Andrew\nGarfields Spider-Man in his universe. But when vulture came to his universe after doctor strange sent him to morbius\nuniverse he had to find morbius and tell him Peter Parker is Spider-Man in his universe and morbius seemed interested in\nSpider-Man since theyre from a different universe. I hope they meet venom and join forces together and find Spider-Man\nin venom 3 .",

    "reviewBody": "I had high hopes for this movie. For what it is, it is good. If you are a comic book fan, then you are going to be\ndisappointed. I am ranking this at a 7 because if you are new to this character and just watching it with no bais then\nyou are going to like this movie.For action, there is a ton of it. It would have been greatly enhanced if it had been\ndone in 3D. No sex scenes, and mild cussing, allows for children of most ages to see it. However, with the onscreen CGI\ntransformations it may cause nightmares.This aside. The story line follows a fast paced \"jump in\" style of story\ntelling. You feel lost in the first few scenes of the movie and then gain footing about 20 minutes in. The best scenes\nsadly are what is shown in the trailers. That being said. There is a romantic side to this story, as many movies have.\nIt is a man with a rare blood condition, who is above averagely smart who happens upon a formula crossing the DNA of a\nVampire Bat with that of a Human, causing a hybrid al a Bruce Banner/Hulk. Dr. Michael Mobius is able to take on\nsupernatural/superhuman abilities such as flight, sonar, and strength, as long as he feeds on a blood substitute that is\nslowly losing its ability for him to survive without drinking human blood.His one and only friend, a boy named Lucian\n\"Milo\" who happens to have the same type of blood issue as Morbius is his benefactor and pays for the controversial and\nstate of the art treatments that leads to their mutual transformation into Vampire hybrids. And as any story arch goes,\nyou have one who is good, and one who turns bad with the new found power. It then turns into a superhuman fight\nthroughout new york with Morbiuss love intrest getting caught up in the middle.",

Anybody reading this , dont blame the actors , the moment Dr Morbius started walking badly \ncrumbled infront of a table in his lab due to bloodlust looked real . I bet you Leto improvised that .Spoilers ahead\nNow as a movie far away comes cinema, standard this movie is a nightmare. Cgi at times looked good but all the other\ntimes it looked bad . Plus who wrote this ?Character doesnt have grief,pain, sorrow, A doctor killing innocents after\ninnocents (?) , Goons are in the protection of a ship (?) , Dr Michael works with one assistant, just one(?) ,\nHorrifically done younger story, unnecessary (?) , Someone edited dark knights score in to this (?) , Theres no police\nwide manhunt for him (?) , Only Two fbi officers are in charge (?) ,\nI could go on but at this point i dont think it deserves more writing  i am writing this review only seeing half of it\n. Some people supporting this are trying to be rebels because of its actors , seriousness  edgy horror ; its\nunderstandable but know this , these three doesnt change the fact its a badly gutted long movie forced to cramp in 1 hr\n45 mins of time .\" Probably this is how covid spread ; A lackluster job \"Stop letting studio executives edit movies . Do\nnot make pg 13 , badly cut movies. I feel extremely sorry for Matt Smith.",

The story seemed out of place with too many holes. Could have made better choices in several areas of the\nmovie.The biggest was probably the too earlier of a reveal of what Morbius was underneath. They should have done it\nclassic. Show him struggle after the serum but come out of it like the experiment was a success. Having him discover his\npowers along the way and possibly might want to use them for good until the artificial blood didnt work and the beast\ninside started to take over. Having Matt Smith all of a sudden know where the serum was in the lab when he was only in\nthere a short amount of time and didnt really understand what was going on.That was the biggest problem. Too rushed and\nmissed opportunities with character development and story. The SFX in the movie werent great, they should have come up\nwith better way of showing his powers that must make it a trailing blur. Needed to stretch it out and make better\ndecisions, could have been a good one.Gave it a 5 because I have seen worse. They can maybe reinvent the character when\nthe Blade movie comes around.",

Im guessing the score rating should get higher as more critics start to\nsee this. This looks like comes after Spider-Man Homecoming and Spider-Man No Way Home. Matt Smith plays Lucien a\nvampire. Both Lucien and Morbius take the serum to save their lives. Morbius prevents Lucien to get the serum as he\nwarns him. Morbius was asleep when Lucien took the serum inside Horizon Labs. Morbius fights Lucien and Martine played\nby Adria Arjona is the assistant was kill by Lucien and Morbius revives her turning her into a vampire. Adrian Toomes\nappears in mid credit scene for the reshoots that is transported to Sony-Marvelverse recruiting Michael Morbius to fight\nSpider-Man. But Tom Holland Spider-Man is not in this universe. There were references to Vlad Dracula the Lord of\nVampires. And vampirism. Will see what happens next?",

Matt Smiths villain is really interesting and his performance was probably the best part of the\nentire movie.

And obviously the worst part was cutting out the Spider-Man references and putting Adrian Toomess\nscenes all in the Post-Credits. I stayed for the Post Credits Scenes, and they were just stupid.

At the same time there were mentions of the boat scene\nthat were involved in the origin comics that pleased me a bit.As for the visuals I enjoyed them. From the slow motion to\nthe sonar ability. Few scenes stood out from the occasional wonky edited background. (Pretty normal for action-based\nfilm).

The problem is that morbius has no connection\nor conflict with spider-man.

    "reviewBody": "Ill give credit where its due, the cat was flawless. SPOILERS: Did it need a voiceover for 5 min explaining things we\nhad just seen? No. Did we need scenes that led to nothing (ex. Taking the lab from the men and then literally 5 min\nlater being back at his OG lab, Matt Smith dancing for 3 min attempting to make being a vampire cool or sexy)? NO. We\nsaw no real turmoil from any of the characters when they realize they have to MURDER TO SURVIVE. And we saw no learning\nto gain control of powers from Morbiuss character, it quite literally went one second from Morbius killing people on\naccident because he needs blood, to him getting vicious at the sight of a TINY cut, then to him being completely fine\nwith blood when with his dying sliced open mentor, all in a span of 10 min. Continuing with that point he didnt need\nany trial and error when it came to anything he did. One second he had never flown, to the next second he just felt the\nairwaves and was off. The plot was so fast pace I genuinely felt like Fantastic Four (2016) was paced better and that\nfilm was catastrophic. There was no cohesiveness when it came to any of the scenes (ex. Bancroft being in her apartment\nbeing watched by Milo, to the next scene she is out on the street somehow aware the police are following her). The\nending was extremely flat with no real battle which I expect when going into any film characterized as\n\"action/adventure\". Also Slo-mo fights DONT MAKE FILMS INTERESTING, it wasted the time needed to develop the plot. Next\ntime use those extra thirty seconds and budget into making a better storyline. I also cant tell how the end credit\nscene makes any sense as to how does Toomes somehow get transported to the wrong universe (thanks to No Way Home) and\nhow does he get his suit, which I had assumed wouldnt have been transported with him. I believe the changes from the\ntrailer and what was shown may have been done due to reshoots but at least make the reshoots more visually interesting\nand exciting than the trailer shots. Im not a huge vampire fan, with that being said I am a huge Marvel fan, and this\nfilm had me in pieces the whole time. Scenes that were meant to be serious ended up being hilarious because they were so\npointless. I understand origin stories have a lot to pack in a short time frame, but they have been done well as shown\nby Venom and the majority of the other Marvel films which had much more intricate and appealing plots.",

Well get real how\nmany vampire movies have I seen, from Dracula to Twilight and What They Do In The Shadows, I know every nuance about\nvampire life, and yet here the movie presumed we knew nothing.Just as the movie was starting to flag in came adult Milo,\nplayed by Matt Smith, he dominated the screen and the stark contrast between the method style of acting and Thespianism\ncould not have been more noticeable. It was great!To me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the\ncharisma, he was proficient in this role but nothing more than that!I really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared, moved,\nflew, glided and transformed the rest was unremarkable.Im giving this a firm 7 outta 10, it was well worth a watch even\nif in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story.",

    "reviewTitle": "Weak origin story",
    "reviewBody": "Morbius has brief moments of quality and good ideas but they are ultimately not enough to elevate a weak origin story\nfor its title character that feels rushed with plenty of pointless elements, lazy writing and laughably bad end credits\nscenes.Jared Leto gives a reasonably charismatic lead performance with a few good jokes but can only do so much with a\nbland character and overall lack of emotional heft. Matt Smith is undoubtedly the standout, completely over the top and\nclearly enjoying it.The CG is extremely messy and distracting, especially in the final fight which is almost completely\nincomprehensible. The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact, made worse by a lack of\nblood and over relicance on slow motion.",

    "reviewTitle": "Its okay, and youll be okay.",
    "reviewBody": "FIRST OFF: I scrolled down through some of these reviews, I understand, and agree with some of the criticisms I see\nabout this film, others.. well I can just see you really want Spidey  Company back at Marvel  I do believe it does\nhelp cloud the judgement just a bit  I get it, now am I saying this movie is perfect? NO. Is it good? Well, no. But\nits okay. To go to the extreme that this movie is the second coming of Fantastic Four (2015) is an extreme to me, and\nIf you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but I will just advise you to go rewatch it again.Morbius is a cool\nlittle movie, that I see as a bigger risk than any of the previous spider-man related projects it has dropped, while I,\nbeing a comic reader for most of my life wasnt jumping for joy when it was announced, I threw my respect for trying it\nat least. The product was what I pretty much expected; the films story does what it can with what very little it has to\nwork with, its not groundbreaking, but I will say I was able to look through its basic dialogue, and story errors to\nsee great performances from both leads (Leto, Smith) The CGI, I believe was worth my price of admission, and I RARELY\nmention that as a positive on any review, I was pretty impressed and had no reason to be. The action scenes are really\ncool, have some fascinating shots, and feel somehow immersive, leaving me with this feeling like I almost was there\nseeing him experience some of the beauty in some powers. There are a few moments that story wise you will scratch your\nhead or ask yourself if you missed something  I believe I fault that on the runtime and I also question what may have\nbeen left on the cutting room floor as I had noticed a couple of scenes from the trailer missing from this movie, which\nI really hope didnt happen but I understand this is a typical studio decision, even though 2 hours is average for a\nblockbuster. An additional, and final criticism I do share with some is that this absolutely shouldve been rated R, no\nquestion about it, and it probably wouldve hit better, but then again the budget cut wouldve probably gave us worse\nlooking CGI.At the end of the day, check it out if youre thinking about it, if youre on the fence, just dont.The real\nlesson is... Film Studios.",

    "reviewTitle": "Morbius Needs A Doctor For Storytelling",
    "reviewBody": "The Make Up/Effects at Points:\nWhen they are investing and putting effort into the movie, the effects are not bad in Morbius. While not really\nachieving what Disney has perfected, there are times where the pale, emaciated figure of Morbius is rather shocking to\nsee and I applaud the ability to make his disease look realistic. Once the vampiric powers start to arise, there are\ntimes where the effects are looking pretty cool, and hold some edge of cool for me in the way they designed the\ntransformation features. Seeing his eyes transform into this blind like state was my particular fate, but other eye\ncolor changes, the warping of the face at times, and even the cool finger effects of his claws were elements I thought\nwere done well for this film. Its again not the most unique or jaw dropping experience weve ever seen, but it works\nfor me.The Special Effects:\nAgain, there is a lot of room for improvement, but at times Morbius manages to shake some things up for using technology\nto make some moments pretty cool. At the lower level of likes is the dash like speed force he has, managing to be\nactually fast, but not too slow-motion madness like Snyder likes. As more powers arise, there are some cool moments that\nhelp make you feel like you are in for the ride (like a virtual coaster), and the sonar is pretty cool in those opening\nmoments. My favorite involves the use of critters, and the nice use of lighting and sound effects to really give you\nthat element of dread, darkness and superhero abilities that we love to hear/see in the theater.The First Part of the\nStory:\nThere is a nice opening to this movie as the first act unfolds for Morbius place in this crazy mixed up universe. A\nnice touching moment between the two main characters, some engaging medical drama moments that match other searches for\nthe cure, and some other set ups got points for engagement for me in this film. If only that quality could have been\nkept for much of the film, but that opening showed great promise for this series.The First Action Scene:\nIts not the most put together scene, but I did like the angle they took with the first fight on the boat. Morbius dive\ninto his powers leads to a predator like moment that held some dynamic angles and approaches to taking on the extras. A\nfew first-person moments, mixed with fleeting glimpses of him in the shadows felt like a hardcore Batman Begins scene\nthat works with this savage nature of Morbius tale. It showed promise for the rest of the film, but that did not quite\npan out.The Acting:\nIts not the best by far, but there were moments where the actors were able to salvage some of the movie with\nperformances that could have been capitalized on. Ariona is stunning on many levels, a combination of beauty, smarts,\nand spirit that makes for a more interesting supporting character for this film. She held a lot of the logic and\ngoodness of the city, but always had the ability to challenge the rules that made her perfect to help with Morbius\nplans. Im going to skip over the other top billed actor due to their low involvement, but Matt Smith as Milo had\nmoments that would have worked had they reigned some of the writing back. Smiths non intense moments do have some heart\nto it, and that first act again shows the promise of a complicated character. When he is forced to go to other extremes,\nthere are times his mannerisms are perfect for the role, and other times a little too much. Still, I enjoyed the\nperformance he brought to some degree. Leto is of course the star of the film, and he tried to do as much as he could\nwith what he was given. Letos first act is strong, and his second act is not bad, but there is just some missing\ndirection or planning that gets lost to the weaknesses of the movie. Overall, there is some decent and good chemistry,\nbut its lost to a lot of other things in this movie.DISLIKES:The Weaker Acting Moments:\nI never expect Oscar roles in these movies, but Ive had enough quality to know stronger acting roles in a superhero\nmovie. Morbius has a lot of shorthanded acting moments, many being cheesy, flat, or just ludicrous with the material\ngiven. As the movie progressed, the acting quality continued to worsen until it was just a messy finish that was\nhumorous at times and lacking on others.The Writing:\nI dont know whats up with the dialogue, but the movies quality in lines also degrades over time. That strong start,\nengaging dialogue with realism and panache are practically absent at the end, and things just become very simplified and\ncut to be almost not needed by the end of the film. Other lines and attempts to be clever find their marks, but most are\nstraight misses for this reviewer, lost to all the over-the-top visuals and lackluster second and third acts that have\ntoo much in them.The Comedy:\nIs very limited for me to be honest. The movies jokes have become stale from the multiple trailers that they have very\nlittle bite to them unless you have missed those trailers. Other jokes are very forced on you, and for me (and most of\nmy audience members) did not generate too many intentional laughs. I hate to say that, but I just did not laugh as much\nas I have at other superhero movies in this film.The Action:\nSony used to be awesome with their superhero action, giving me those high-flying Spiderman moments that to this day\nstill get me stoked for what they did. However, Morbius darker atmosphere offered some chances to tear into the\nfighting again as he explored the nature of his powers. While some of these effects did accomplish this, much of the\naction was lame for me, quick bouts of overexaggerated moves that were over before they started. No coordination, no\ntitanic displays of powers, just a few quick blurs into slow motion snarls dont make for the most entertaining battles\nfor me. Throw some choreography, a bit of fun moves, and some other tropes and this could have worked. And as a plus,\ndrop the Snydervision antics down a peg if possible.The Visual Effects: The Other side:\nSome things look awesome and others are showing the limitations of Sonys group and the impact on budgets. I cant say\nits the worst, because they can still do better than me, but the cheesy visuals dilute the vampiric mode they were\nstriving to design. During the creature moments, prosthetics could have helped with this, while also tightening up the\nCGI to not look so fake and artificial. Its nothing that destroys the movie for the most part, but Disney again has\nproven their merit in this element.The Story:\nThis is the weakest element of the movie for me, and the part that I think weakness many of the other elements mentioned\nabove. Morbius first act actually is not bad, a little predictable, a few extra cut moments, but sets the stage for\nethical dilemmas that will be tested in the coming hour and a half. And then comes the second act where suddenly things\npick up pace, lots of elements are pushed in, action scenes get muddy, and build up/testing is rather low, dropping all\nthat preparation. The movie tries to fight quality and speed at this point, and the thing that suffers is suspense and\ncharacter utilization, which is very poor in this movie. Big name actors, and roles get various levels of showing up on\nscreen, most of which feel very weak to the promise being made. Once the third act hits... the movie is rushing to not\nonly wrap up this chapter with an \"exciting\" climax, but also set up for the next movie if they get greenlit.\nUnfortunately, this failed miserably for me and felt like a sweep under the rug. Unlike Venom, the after credits scene\ncould not redeem the ending, and even these scenes dont quite make sense or have the punch I think was envisioned. Had\nthe story been balanced and not as much crammed in, perhaps all these dislikes would be likes.The VERDICT:\nMorbius is indeed one of the weaker installments of the Marvel series, and it all comes down to planning, writing and\nbalance, which this movie lacks. Sure, there are moments that do work for me, the first act in particular being the\nstrongest part, alongside some effects and fighting do work for me. The acting does its best with the material, but it\ncan only do so much with what it was given, which is not much at times. Where the movie fails though is that the visual\neffects are lacking at times, alongside mundane action sequences that utilize little of the imagination Sony once held\nfor their hero flicks. Its really the writing and story though that just have everything collapse, a rush mess that\nseemed to take hits with each delay, including the hasty wrap up and teasers that they are trying to lure you back in\nwith for the sequel that may come. Its too much in one movie and it really pales in comparison to a lot of other things\nin this category. Thus, the effects may be the only worthy theater visit quality, while I give a strong nod to seeing\nthis at home if you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Horror: 5.5\nMovie Overall: 4.0-4.5.",

    "reviewBody": "This is not a bad movie. The reviews so far must be DC trolls or from EU bureaucrats. But neither is this a very good\nmovie, mainly because it feels short, or incomplete. I saw someone complain over studio interference, and if so that\nmake sense and would explain the short run time and what feels like cut-off scenes.I have 3 major complaints about this\nmovie.The first being what I already mention that the movie feels too short. I got the same feeling as when I was the\noriginal JL movie, you can tell that it was unnecessarily and weirdly cut down. Here it feels like the studio cut out 20\nmin or so. The second complaint I have is that the filming is too dark. I get it is bats, superheroes and things that\nhide in the dark, but you do not need to make everything muddy and unclear. The third objection I have is that this is\nvery standard. They took no risks whatsoever. What you think this movie is, that is exactly what it is. This is almost\nas generic as BlackPanter was, and this movie follow almost the exact same pattern as that movie so without saying\nanything more you now know 95% of the plot of the movie just by reading this sentence. They could have taking this\nbloodier R-rating, or at least taken a few turns that is different to all other similar movies.With those things out of\nthe way this is still decently entertaining. We got a bit spoiled with great superhero movies the past couple of decades\nso this is nothing special, but if this had been out in the 1990s it would likely been celebrated as one of the best\nsuperhero movies of all time. Morbius is definitely worth a watch and worth the movie ticket. You will not be bored, the\nacting is great, music and costumes spot on, CGi is mostly great (a few misses) and the movie has good dialogue and a\ngood ending. I am not sure why people complain.I give this a 6/10, but I will upgrade to a 7/10 to offset all the\nnegative reviews.",

    "reviewTitle": "Even with Low Expectations, this Marvel Movie Disappoints",
    "reviewBody": "I have been a fan of Marvel films since I was a kid and I always try to look for the good in them first, simply because\nI dont enjoy disliking them. When a superhero story is told very well, theyre some of my favourite stories out there.\nWhen Sony began to branch out their Spider-Man universe and make villain films, I was very worried. I had some fun with\nboth Venom films, but neither were great by any means. Well, the latest Sony/Marvel villain film, Morbius, has just hit\nthe big screen, and its not good, which is saying a lot coming from me.Trying to cure himself of a rare condition, Dr.\nMichael Morbius (Jared Leto) discovers that there may be a cure hidden in the blood of bats. After injecting himself to\nfind out, he morphs himself into some kind of vampire. From here, he begins to lose control, creating casualties along\nthe way. His best friend Milo (Matt Smith) also has this condition, so Im sure you can guess where the villain\nstoryline comes into play here. So now that you have the just of the premise, lets dive in.Firstly, Im not going to\nignore the elements that worked for me overall. Ill admit that this is the best Ive seen from Jared Leto in a while\nand the chemistry he shared with Martine (Adria Arjona) was absolutely a highlight of the film. The tone suits whats\ngoing on and I enjoyed the look of it overall, but the tone and slow pacing eventually grind the film to a halt on a few\noccasions. Im also all for a darker hero/anti-hero story in the Marvel universe because we havent had much of that,\nbut there just wasnt enough of a good story being told to back that up. There was an effort here, it just didnt work\nfor me.So, why didnt this film work? Well, I was instantly turned off by the first scene, as the discovery of the bats\nis literally the opening sequence. Just a couple of scenes later hes already injecting himself and the cure begins to\nwork. Its almost like the first act of the film was condensed to five minutes. Moving along, there are many scenes of\ndialogue that drag on, while the important plot points seem to be brushed over as bullet points. Morbius is so focused\non getting to the good stuff, but its sacrificing its characters in the process. On top of not really caring about what\nwas going on, the finale just felt like another CGI fight that lasts for about 20 minutes. Those sequences can be\ntolerable or even great if theyre part of a good film, but I just found myself rolling my eyes this time.In the end,\nMorbius is a film that takes place in the same world as Venom (maybe?) and Spider-Man (maybe?), but I was too confused\nwith the conclusion of the film to really know where it takes place. Id almost say it takes place in its own world.\nMorbius is a movie that clearly feels tampered with in post-production, and not in a good way. I do like Jared Leto as\nthis character so I will gladly sit through a film that includes him, but I really dont care to see a series of films\nbased solely on Morbius. Once the credits rolled I had no desire to recommend it to anyone and I cant see myself\nrevisiting it, unless necessary. Morbius, even with low expectations on my part, sadly disappointed me.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvels Gothic Tale Of Vampire-Fame Superhero Will Drain All Your Blood",
    "reviewBody": "Morbius (2022) :\nMovie Review -Marvel means superhero. But is it completely true? Can Marvel be something different too? Yes, it can be.\nCan it be something related to vampires? Yes. Heres Morbius to give you all the answers. You see, this concept of\nfailed experiments (of scientists or doctors) or side effects of experiments is way too old in Hollywood. James Whale\nmade some iconic films like Frankenstein (1931), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935) with this\nformula in the horror genre. George Waggner followed Whales footprints and made \"The Wolf Man\" (1941).Those early\nexperiments were shocking to the audience in that era because Hollywood was establishing new genres then. But the same\nstuff became old and cliched with films like \"Hallow Man\" (2000), \"Spider Man\" (2002), \"Hulk\" (2003) and a few others.\nSome films used the formula of a failed experiment to show the good guys, while some used it for the bad ones. Spider\nMan 3 came with that Venom thing, which showed us two characters being haunted by the same supernatural power, and\nrecently we saw a Malayalam superhero flick, \"Minnal Murali,\" (2021) with the same thought. Marvels Morbius is quite\nsimilar to these two films. But it has a damn boring plot and a predictable twist that just doesnt survive.In the film,\nDr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease with the help of his girlfriend and\nfellow doctor, Martine (Adria Arjona), but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. He is\nblessed with enormous powers, but he doesnt know how to control them. Is it a gift or a curse? His surrogate brother,\nMilo (Matt Smith), shows him the other side of this new invention, which creates differences between them. Who will win\nin the end? A good vampire or an evil one? The second half of Morbius provides you with all the answers, and believe me,\nthere is nothing unpredictable or new here.Marvel films are usually not dark, but this one is an exception. I dont need\nto explain what happens when Marvel tries something dark and intense. The fans dont expect them to make such films.\nThey just want entertainment and larger-than-life characters with screaming heroic acts, not a story. With Morbius,\nMarvel fans get neither of them. Morbius is not a superhero film, actually. It just ends up being a superhero flick,\nsomehow. A vampire drama is nothing new for us. From \"The Golem\" (1920), \"Nosferatu\" (1922), \"Dracula\" (1931), and many\nother well-known horror films and TV shows (in every industry across the world), the idea just doesnt change. Then how\ncan Morbius be an exception? It just happens to be dropped in the wrong universe and at the wrong time, thats all.Jared\nLeto has been impressive in the last 5-6 years, with some good acting credits to his name. So, Morbius was a simple task\nfor him because VFX did the majority of the work for him. Well, this is not just the acting-driven role he deserves, but\nhes fine with whatever acting-loaded scenes he has got. Matt Smith is surprising, though. His character comes as a\nsurprise, and thats still digestible, I should say, but his performance too comes as a surprise, and thats a pleasant\nsurprise, I must say. The gorgeous looking Adria Arjona hasnt got too many long scenes, but whenever she appears, she\nmakes sure that you notice her presence. Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibsons support is strictly okay.Morbius\nis full of colourful visuals. It looks unnecessary and illogical as the colour themes and that foggy smoke behind the\nvampires dont really make any sense, but dont know why, the screen appeal carries it through. It doesnt bore, and\nthats too much, but the screenplay does. Also, the fighting scenes are shot from close angles - putting a lot of strain\non your eyes for some time. Nevertheless, a few of them are brilliantly shot, and indeed, they entertain you. However, a\nlittle more practical sense would have only helped.Morbius mediocrity is not limited to the writing, but also reflects\non Daniel Espinosas outdated vision. Come on man, I mean, its 2022, not 1982 to show so much repetitiveness on screen.\nEspinosas directional techniques drain all the blood out of Morbius body. Somehow, the soul survives due to Marvels\ncomic tale. Rest, its a strictly below-average show saved by some breathtaking action sequences and somewhat pleasant\nvisual effects. Dont expect anything more than that, not even a penny, because if you do, Morbius will suck all your\nblood during those 106 minutes. Overall, an underwhelming Gothic tale with uneven Marvel stamping all over. SKIP\nIT!RATING - 4/10*",

    "reviewTitle": "Halloween film",
    "reviewBody": "Morbius Review-\nMinor SpoilersPros:\n1. Entertaining. This film is only 1 hour and 44 minutes long and goes by pretty fast. The first half of the movie is\ndefinitely better than the rest. I was surprised it actually has some cool parts and Dr. Michael Morbius is a\nkind-hearted person deep down and has elements that reminded me of Eddie Brock. I definitely need an oversized pajama\nshirt of Morbiuss scary face on it now! His character I think has potential.2. Martine Bancroft. The main female\ncharacter Dr. Martine Bancroft is a colleague of Dr. Morbius and in the comics becomes his fianc. She brings cool female\ntouch to the horror of this movie, I ended up liking her character.In comparison to Venoms Anne Weying (Michelle\nWilliams) Martine (Adria Arjona) is a cooler better supporting character and a lot more loyal. Okay yes and she also has\na cat (which Morbius lets hang around).3. The 2 mid credit scenes. The theater that I was in, like smart Marvel fans,\nstayed around for the credits and it was the moment that people cheered. I wont go into details with what they were but\nit was awesome! It definitely is part of the other Marvel universes.Cons:\n1. The villain. Matt Smith who is supposedly a good actor in other films SUCKED in this (no pun intended). In my\npersonal opinion he is what dragged this movie down. Jared Leto is apparently a better actor than Matt Smith, at least\nin this film. His character Milo has a scene that is about as cringeworthy as Venom dancing in the club in Let there be\nCarnage.2. A lot of CGI. There are a lot of scenes of CGI and fight scenes that kind of make the movie lame because of\nthe floating weird aura around them as they move. When Dr. Morbius goes full vampire, as he looks in the photo, he looks\nsuper creepy and awesome but most of the time him and his villain dont look that cool, and of course very fake.3. Some\nthings didnt add up. I was a little bit confused as to how his origin begins. There is a scene where Dr. Michael is\nstanding in front of the bat cave with his bloody hand out, but then another seen where hes injecting himself with the\n\"cure\". It took me a minute to realize which one happened first and then later. Also theres another scene which I\ndidnt like regarding him and Martine (I wont go into details for spoilers) but I understood it later. There were some\nscenes that definitely needed help.If you love dark perfect-for-Halloween type films you will enjoy this. It has its\nmoments where its like Venom, but not as cool or endearing. If you pass on it I understand, its not Marvels best, but\nfor the Marvel boys, go judge it for yourself.For the record, Jared Leto is not in any way like the Joker at all in this\nmovie. It lacks a lot but for a Halloween movie its cool. 6.5/10.",

Even when\ntheyre terrible. But, those same critics give shows and films bad reviews that dont deserve it. Like halo and morbius.\nI for one am glad I went to the cinema to see it. Unlike endgame. 3hrs Ill never get back. In short. Dont go by dodgy\ncritic reviews. If you like the trailer and the synopsis sounds interesting. Watch it. Make your own mind up. Dont be a\nsheep.

The CGI was great and not as over the top as other reviews may say. I do\nwonder if this was originally slated for a 3D release as it would make sense for all the effects surrounding the action\nscenes.

No fanboy apologist or hater here either. I love\nthe best of the Marvel and DC films, as well as serious dramas, arthouse, foreign films, select horror and more.Given\nthe dismal reviews here and from critics we went in with very low expectations and were pleasantly surprised!While its\nnowhere near the high bar that has been set in recent years by other comic adaptations its not even the worst Marvel\nmovie in recent years. One of those in my party said they liked it better than Eternals, and I think its markedly\nbetter than the Edward Norton Hulk, the first Thor film, the first Suicide Squad, the theatrical Justice League, and\nX-Men Age of Apocalypse / Dark Phoenix as well.Even marginally better than both Venom films in my opinion.Thats not to\nsay its great, but it had enough fun moments and redeeming qualities to make it worth a watch.Apart from the first\naction scene which was solid, most of the rest were not particularly thrilling.Jared Leto was solid enough and Matt\nSmith was great.Plot was a bit thin, dialogue was proficient, and pacing was good.Special effects were good, general\ntone and atmosphere was well done, and the styling of Morbius monstrous side was perfect.If the trailer held any appeal\nwhatsoever and you go in with very measured expectations theres more to enjoy here than the current ratings would\nsuggest.",

The characters are weak, the plot is clich and\nhas holes, the editing is choppy, theres an unfunny cop duo who I presume were supposed to be some sort of comic\nrelief, and an anticlimactic ending.

It caused many inconsistencies within the plot, focusing on trying to get\nthe point across without doing the work to achieve its goals. Every scene of the film looks chopped up and filmed oddly\nwith camera movements that never rest for one moment to meditate on the actions taking place. The performances are non\nexistent due to the amount of distracting visuals and pretentious story elements that are thrown at the viewers face.\nThe film lacks any flavor or distinct personality, that makes the film feel generic, passionless, and ultimately\nforgettable.

    "reviewBody": "Going into this movie I was expecting it to be bad, borderline unbearable, largely due to the critic reviews. Oh boy did\nthey get it wrong. This movie is far from as bad as they say, but I also would not describe it as anything spectacular.\nI feel that people are comparing it to other Marvel properties such as No Way Home and that is why reviews are so bad.\nThat is unfair to compare it to such other films as Morbius is a fresh take on Marvel it feels. It is obvious that the\ndelays ended up holding back what this movie could have been, perhaps what it truly should have been. It was enjoyable\nto watch from start to end. Loved the action sequences and CGI was beautiful. Takes a little bit to get through the more\nmonotonous beginnings, but once you get to sink your teeth into the good parts, oh boy does it deliver. Some characters\nneeded more development and the story what is a bit disjointed. Jared Leto is finally in a role that suits him, Morbius\nand Leto will only get better with more appearances. I rated it a 7/10 because a 7/10 to me means that it was an\nenjoyable movie regardless of whatever may be wrong with it, and I would gladly watch again. It is clear it would have\nbeen better suited as a rated R film, but with its current restrictions down to PG-13 I would say it is worth a watch at\nleast. Dont expect to be blown away, except maybe by some of the action and CGI. I can see ratings from 5/10 to 7/10\nbeing a fair range as everyones taste are different, but some of these other reviews I see are just taking it too far\nbecause it is not what Marvel is used to pushing.",

Its baseline superhero shlock, but even its expected plot points are underwhelming\nbecause Morbius is disinterested in itself. The characters are boring, the romance is empty, the growth is stagnant, and\nthe final fight is disappointing. Plus, Jared Leto is a complete flatline, providing no charisma or vulnerability to\nrelate to. In every way, Morbius is void of emotional investment, leaving its blatant commercialism to stick out like a\nsore thumb. Simply put, Morbius is soulless.Technically, Morbius is less incompetent but still shallow. The sound is\nadequate and the effects are convincing (although CGI is severely overused), but those are the only positives. The music\nis a cheap imitation and occasionally awkward. The production design is painfully generic, with a noticeable lack of\nblood. The inconsistent editing warps the pacing and jumbles action sequences. Also, the imagery is bland, dark, and\ncluttered, which is unpleasant and confusing. Lastly, Morbius doesnt have direction. There isnt a tone, message, or\npassion driving this film. Its completely stale and clearly a cash grab. Viewers beware.Writing: 2/10\nDirection: 3/10\nCinematography: 3/10\nActing: 4/10\nEditing: 3/10\nSound: 5/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 4/10\nProduction Design: 4/10\nCasting: 7/10\nEffects: 5/10Overall Score: 4.0/10.",

Mobius is in a lot of ways the Atypical Anti-Hero\nmovie, but it also adds more to the character complexity of Michael Mobius, in the comics he was a gradstudent competing\nalongside Peter parker and injected himself with a sample of his blood, I enjoyed the fact that the method used for his\nChara Ter development was introduced in a more unique fashion.

Hes typically a\nsupporting role in bigger movies but he killed it as the main character. I dont understand the hate around this movie.\nYes it couldve been at least 15 minutes longer with more action scenes, but for a Sony/Marvel movie they did a great\njob and was up to pare with their other movie Venom. I believe this movie deserves a lot better ratings then what its\nreceiving and I definitely believe its worth the watch.",

Especially the CGI.The major fail is the timeline and\nthis whole thing where they try to connect the dots in a weird/confusing way. I was baffled a few times on what the heck\nwas going on, obviously I understood it, but it was odd.Jared Leto did an OK job, considering that Im not a fan of his\nmovies, and Im someone who hated his Joker in Suicide Squad. Otherwise, all the other actors were doing ok.I see what\nSony is doing, and I wanna say this: Dear Sony, LISTEN TO MARVEL!! And stop trying to act like you got it. You dont.\nMarvel knows better.

The goal of the main protagonist doesnt appear to be\nrealised, its just that a fight has been won.It felt like given 40 minutes more of screentime, the story could have\nbeen taken to a better place.",

    "reviewBody": "6.3/10I dont know anything about \"Morbius\", but I was expecting, more. It was entertaining, but it took a long time to\nbe so. The story was alright and seemed to jump around in a weird order. I felt lost a few times trying to figure where\nin the story I was. At one hour and forty-five minutes, the timing felt way too long. I got bored and by the time the\nparts that seemed to give the movie substance, I was over it and couldnt wait for the film to end. I also disliked the\nwhole villain aspect. He never seemed convincing and lacked any true hate for the character.The only reason I can\njustify giving this film a six is because visually the film was awesome, the sound along with the score was incredible,\nand the use of echolocation in the characters was interesting.Overall, I would recommend seeing this film on cheap\nnight, or possibly even waiting for it to home release. The base of the film was good, but it failed to grasp any true\ntraction. The length of the film wouldve been good if the story was actually interesting. Visually stunning and the\nsoundtrack was actually amazing.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps you make a decision\non it.Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

I mean there are indeed some really flat shots and ugly sequences but its not all bad,\nand thats where the list of positives end.Now let me be clear: I hate writing super negative reviews because it feels\nlike Im bullying the people who worked on this, movies are hard to make and all, but I have next to no sympathy for\nstudio cashgrab movies they had the budget to make it good and took the easy way out, I do feel bad for Jared Leto and\nMatt Smith, I love Matt, and I want him to be in better stuff, but hes awful in this. I have a really hard time blaming\nLeto and Smith for their bad performances because it honestly doesnt entirely feel like their fault, rather it feels as\nthough the writers are to blame. The script is dinosaur dung incarnate, I have no idea how someone proof read this and\nsaid \"yeah thats good,\" Morbius and Milo have 0 character whatsoever, no defining character traits, no development, no\ndepth, not even a motive, no thats not a joke they have no motive whatsoever. Milo was crippled as a kid and he was\nbullied as a kid now he wants vampire powers so he can walk and kill people who arent crippled? I say this as a\nquestion because thats what I thought his motive was until it just changed at the middle, he just becomes a bad guy who\nwants to kill Morbius for some unspoken reason; I assume its because Morbius didnt give him the serum when he asked\nfor it, but not only is this poorly conveyed to the viewer, but its such petty drama and makes his character look like\na giant child.Morbius is just a doctor guy I honestly dont know what his goal even is or who hes supposed to be, he\nhas a love interest but the romance is soooo forced, him and his lady friend share 3 scenes together, kiss, and thats\nit. They have 0 reason to be together at all, and the woman who plays his lady friend was a bad actress as well. Theres\ntwo detective characters who they keep cutting back to but theyre completely pointless, in fact, they just forget about\nthem by the end of the movie. The \"jokes\" in this movie were hilarious, so hilarious in fact, that whenever they said a\njoke, NOBODY in my theater laughed. I think I heard a guy cough once. And talk about cliche, holy crap this movie\nfollows that marvel formula to a tee, even ending with that same goddamn giant cgi epilepsy fight, but this time its so\nunbelievably lame and uninspired, and theres no reason for it to happen at all. The cgi was terrible, it mightve been\nworse than Venom, it feels so tryhardy, like this movie really wants you to think it looks cooler than it actually does.\nSome really goofy stuff happens in this movie as well but its so far and few between that it makes it so you cant even\nwatch it in the same way as Venom. Characters will die and it makes no impact at all because they arent fleshed out in\nthe slightest, and dont get me started on Morbiuss powers, he can like glide on wind or something, he cant do it when\nhe needs to fly off a building but he can fly... in front of a train? What? And even though he says he has \"bat sonar\"\nits just super hearing, like do the writers even know what sonar is? The ending in this movie was horrible sequel bait\nnonsense, it was completely unsatisfying and just stupid this whole movie is so stupid and it doesnt even know it.Do\nnot waste your time or money viewing this piece of trash, it is boring nonsense from start to finish, it not a so bad\nits good movie like venom, more of a so pathetic its dull type of movie.",

Now...\nPros:\n*The PLOT was easy to follow straight to the point, you know exactly what Michael is doing  for what reason  why he\ndoes what he does, when things go wrong\n*Theme was just fine for me overall, though it might fall for some, in this department depends on the individual\n*Characters is both a pro  con for me, you have some who were enjoyable, some you might care less for. Michael, Martine\n Emil were the ones I enjoyed more  wanted to see more of in this film\n*Attention to detail when it came to showing us his abilities was very interesting for me. The hearing, sonar, flight,\nspeed in a manner I personally havent seen before so that was refreshing. We already seen plenty of super\nstrength.Cons:\n*Action \"Venom Effect\" as I call it, there are action scenes in the film lol some looked good once you got use to the\nspeed trail effect during the lighter scenes,but some of the more darker ones \"Venom effect\" you could barely make out\nat times what is actually transpiring cause its so dark.*Villain was just boring this is where the film was falling for\nme. Just wasnt a overall good villain. Motives you get, but overall Milo just wasnt it. Why not use BLACKOUT maybe or\nVIC SLAUGHTER whos just a ruthless vampire from Morbius own creation which I thought Milo was suppose sorta at 1st,but\nfell extremely short..since where diving into the more cosmic side now LILLITH wouldve been interesting character to\nuse, but enough on that,decent start for a origin see it for yourself, only way to go from here is up.",

To let the superheros fight on. It lacks when we - as audience - notice.I found no\npoint of redundancy of pinning the woman to stick on our heads as main character, not gone, awake!I found no point of\nromance scenes!! Maybe later which I never go to watch such low quality series that start with weak spark  zero\nbuild-up for the main characters or even.One last good thing: Superhero is curse. It was so good to be mentioned.One\nlast bad thing: why superhero movies keep showing up the police as weak as we know, I think it is pointless for big\nsegment of audience like the teenagers for example!

I just didnt\ncare about any of the characters and kept checking my watch hoping it would finish. Sony should just hand over the\nmarvel heroes they hold to Marvel studios as they have zero clue as to how to make a marvel movie. The first Venom was\nokay but let there be carnage was on another level terrible....just step aside Sony just step aside.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a\nfilmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the\nsenses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the films cleverness and style, it hinges on the\nperformance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin\nLandau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most\ncommanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop\nwith Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times Ive seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving\nJules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he\nlost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. Ill be the first in\nline to see the finished product.",

Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been\nreleased in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the\nultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me\ntowards a career in the film industry.

A world where the so-called \"anti-socials\" are far more complicated\nthan the \"normal people\" (as Im writting this, and I use the term \"normal people\" I laugh, and feel dirty).  These anti\nsocials are haunted by greater problems.  Self-finding issues. Tarantino uses the questions raised by one-self to make\nthe characters of the movie think about their lives.  To think about what theyre doing with them.  As Jules says, hes\ntrying to be the sheperd.  Even God gets involved.  Even God has a chance.  Even bad guys can change. In more technical\npurposes, the director (Q. Tarantino), uses an infinity of signs, and symbols to put us throughout the story...once\nagain, not a simple plot, but a whole world.  The camera movement, although not ground-stomping, jaw-dropping, is fine.\nOne thumb up.  Fine directing. The story, on the other hand...woooow!  Leaves me speechless, breathless, etc.  Its an\nextasy just to read the script, just to think of it as a book.  Hats off for Tarantino as a writter...Avary too.\nFinally, bashing a little bit, Tarantino needs some expertise as a director, but his writting skills are top-notch.",

Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesnt\ngive us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The\nlanguage, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not \"Glorified\" by this movie.  If you make a movie about\nmodern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that\nrespect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.\nThen he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite\nmovie ever, but its definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as\nthose who hate it.

Starting from the scene in the car where Vincents little accident occurs, all the way to\nJimmys place and the last scene in the diner is absolutely riveting and most enjoyable to watch. The cast is just\namazing, and although I thought Samuel L. Jackson was simply the best, I also really liked Quentin Tarantinos little\nrole- he was wonderfully irritating as Jimmy.

But there are other scenes, like Willis and his girlfriend in the\nhotel room, where Im screaming mercy. They are dreadfully boring scenes. And Im still not sure what the movie was\nabout. So all in all, Pulp Fiction is a better than average movie. But its not a \"great\" movie like some people rave.\n\"Jackie Brown\", Quientin Trantinos other hit, is just as good. And if your looking for a dark humored comedy, check out\n\"Fargo\" which is much better",

Where, John Travolta is talking to Samuel L. Jackson in the car about what they\ncall different burgers in fast food resteraunts in Europe. I thought that was hilarious and a classic. People might of\nthought the swearing was heavy, but I thought it added a sort of... real tense to the movie. The acting was the best you\nwill see in a while. The performaces by Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Vingh Rahmes, and Bruce Willis\nwere fantastic. After seeing this movie I knew why it was nominated for Academy Awards including Best Picture. I think\nMr. Tarentino introduced a new type of movie, that I wouldnt mind seeing more of. I hope he continues to write movies\nlike this one. It was funny, scary, dramatic, and in its own way romantic. If I were a real critic and my say mattered,\nI would unanomously make this my favorite movie of all time. I recommended this movie to anyone who is looking for a\nmovie to watch for a fun time.",

This film centers around four\ndifferent stories; two hit men accidentally shoot preteen informant in the back of their car, a boxer that refuses to\nthrow a fight, and a doped upped hit man takes his drug dealing pimp daddys coke head wife on a date and a hit man is\n`saved. The stories are separate but come together like a bad episode of Seinfeld. Just to be cool and `avant-guard\nTarantino picked up his script and shuffled the pages together, added a thick smattering of pop culture riddled\ndialogue, and plagiarized every movie ever made.There is not one redeeming character or idea in this movie. Most hail it\nas deep, but  but that is only because they are shallow. I have questioned many of the films devotees as to why they\nlike it, but they can scarcely say more than `its cool or they comment on it being glamourous-$500 cocaine baggies of\nheroin and $5 milkshakes. On its own terms, the movie is poorly crafted. Its much appraised non-linear story line is\nnothing new. Orson Wells challenged that institution 50 years ago with Citizen Kane. This doesnt enhance the story at\nall, except blunting Vincent Vegas (Travolta) pointless demise. He is alive when the credits roll, so he essentially\navoids the repercussions of his actions. And finally,  Jules (Jackson) misquoting scriptures and misapplication of the\ntext was highly annoying. Besides, because he `found God, he is absent when his partner needed him the most. So by\nTarantinos definition, God is as debased as the characters portrayed in this horrible movie. The only thing that is\nredeeming in this movie is the soundtrack. Maybe Tarantino should have been a DJ.",

In fact, the ones that keep that\nstuff to a minimum are usually the ones that do the best at the box office.  No, Im not saying that you should make\neverything all happy and perfect and \"Leave it to Beaver-\"esque, because things should be believable on film.

I have seen a lot of comments about the\nfilms morality, but a film should first of all entertain.What I hate about a movie is if it is too predictable you know\nwhat is going to happen after 15 minutes or I feel cheated if the plot is too convoluted purely to confuse me. Pulp\nFiction does neither of these but just gives you enough changes of pace to keep you guessing how the stories are going\nto come together.   And how they do!  When you see Vincent and Jules at the diner for the last scene you just KNOW\nwhats going to happen next but Tarantino keeps us dangling with some really funny dialogue about bacon when all  were\nwaiting for is the inevitable confrontation.This film is a collection of classic scenes and funny one-liners (the\nadrenalin-shot scene has to be my favourite).  To look at whether this is a moralistic film is the wrong way to look at\nit.  Its never going to be as uplifting as, say, The Shawshank Redemption, but it never pretends to that kind of film.\nBut it does have depth. After you watch it more than once you start to think of the \"What Ifs\"Probably the most\nprofound is the mix of Faith in God versus Faith in Superstition.  When Jules says that he felt the touch of God, was\nthis a true warning to him and would HE have been shot instead of Vincent if he hadnt changed his ways.  Or was God\ntrying to save Pumpkin and Honey Bunny through Jules?  Or was Vincent the one that God was trying to warn but he didnt\nfeel the touch of God and so lost his life and possibly his soul to the Devil.  The briefcases combination is 666 so\nthere is definite imagery of Hell here.And Butch has Faith in Superstition with the dubious history of the lucky watch.\nWhat if he never went back for the watch?  Would he have ever escaped the hitmen looking for him?  And was it the fact\nthat he had just put the lucky watch on that helped him get the better of Vincent?  And what seems like a really unlucky\nencounter when he runs down Marcellus and then gets taken hostage by the shopkeeper actually gives him probably the only\nchance to wipe the slate clean by saving Marcellus himself.  So if the watch really was lucky, what more luck could you\nask for??A great movie and 10 out of 10 for entertainment (and not just the first time you watch it - tho that was the\nbest for all the surprises).",

    "reviewTitle": "Overrated, but not worthless",
    "reviewBody": "Few movies made in the last five years have inspired such impassioned criticism and intense adulation as Quentin\nTarentinos Pulp Fiction. Most viewers either love it or hate it. Only a few folks, like myself, land in the middle\nground in their critical view of it.Is Pulp Fiction the best film of the 90s ? Certainly not. Schindlers List, LA\nConfidential, GoodFellas and Saving Private Ryan should all rank far above it in 90s film retrospective lists it when\nthe decade (as mediocre and uninspired an era of filmmaking as Hollywood has ever seen) is over. All four movies are\nmore coherent and precise in their treatments of their individual subjects. All four pictures are more convincing and\nall do a better job than Pulp Fiction of balancing their remarkable style with substance.At its best Pulp Fiction is a\nrollicking, chaotic swirl of color, melodramatic tension and 90s pop iconography. The movie has a wonderfully sharp and\nstylish look--like a celluloid version of the comic books and cheap novelettes which inspired its story. The editing is\nbrilliant in its quirkiness and unconventionality. The movie jumps from panel to panel with breathtaking intensity, much\nlike a graphic crime novel. The fractured narrative structure of Pulp Fiction keeps the audience off balance: its a\nsuperb touch that allows the movies narrative twists and turns and visceral images to impact on the viewers.At the same\ntime Pulp Fictions strengths are also its weaknesses.Too often the movie is \"over-stylized\" and technical. Its like a\nbrilliant film students dream picture--too cute and \"too cool\" in its inventiveness and technical precision.\nTarantinos unabashed tribute to pulp novels and movies can be both a joy and a bother to behold. At times, Tarantinos\nobviousness and lack of subtlety is grating. The movies dialogue suffers most from this malaise.Those who praise Pulp\nFictions script as \"brilliant\" ought to run down to their local video store and rent Howard Hawks The Big Sleep and\nRoman Polanskis Chinatown. Both scripts are everything that Pulp Fiction TRIES (and fails) to be: funny, quirky, cool,\nsubtle and substantial. Indeed, it is a sad commentary on current society that anyone could Pulp Fictions muddled\nscreenplay \"brilliant\" when placed against masterpieces of screenwriting like The Big Sleep.In writing Pulp Fictions\nscript Quentin Tarentino tried too hard. The screenplay is loaded with lame modern pop cliches and cutesy cultural\nreferences. The overly slick script nearly mars the brilliant acting efforts of Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and\nothers. In light of all of this, the trite theme of redemption that runs through the movie comes across as false and\nshallow.Nonetheless, Pulp Fiction is still worthwhile viewing. For all of its flaws it succeeds in entertaining the\naudience. Samuel L. Jacksons performance--a sign of his great talent--alone makes it worth seeing. If viewers take the\nmovie with a grain of salt they should enjoy it. It they want depth or profundity they should look elsewhereRating: 3\nout of 5 stars, 81/100.",

    "reviewBody": "If you think \"Pulp Fiction\" is brilliant, youre wrong. Its more than that. Its a milestone in the history of film\nmaking. Its already a classic. But why? Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces\non the rear window of a car? No, thats surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority\n- dont get it). Tarantino has made a movie thats someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies.\nWhats so different? He knows the subject of the movie is \"cool\", he knows its a product of mass culture, and he even\nlikes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first\npoint. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely arent another action\nheroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and\nMcDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What\nelse is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? Its the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of\nhumour and the whole rest. In my opinion its all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.",

The Bruce Willis \"Gimp\" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know\nthe one) is absolutely unbearable.

But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, its excessive,\nthe way the three stories are told is confusing, and...thats about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as\nMarsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me.

Him and his films get by on retro-mania, smugness, and arrogance, and will date as horribly\nas his source material has. Tarantino is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with indie filmmaking in the nineties,\nand nineties youth culture in general. Cinema, and the world, could have done without him.",

    "reviewTitle": "Over the Hill?",
    "reviewBody": "When I saw Pulp Fiction 4 years ago, I have to say I was busting out laughing with everyone else in the audience. The\nvibrant dialogue, the intertwined storylines and unexpected plot twists took me by surprise. I took my girlfriend(now\nex-girlfriend) to see Pulp Fiction a few weeks later, and she didnt laugh at any of the funny parts, and definitely\ntook exception to the violence. Of course we got in a big fight over the whole thing in the car ride home. I couldnt\nbelieve that anyone with half a liver and a thyroid as their only major organs, could not see the brilliance that\nTarrantino had crafted.I watched Pulp Fiction for again since the last time I saw it with my ex, and you know what? I\nreally didnt like it as much. Now much can be said about this reaction. Maybe my ears and eyes began to bleed with the\npost-Tarrantino melee of knock off culture that ensued after Pulp Fiction. Things that were already cool for twenty\nyears, like Dick Dale, or Kool and the Gang got incessantly beat into our heads as \"the new hip thing\". Fine, maybe I\nharbor a little resentment for how the mainstream will eventually water down anything that has any artistic merit. I\nthink I even saw a butter commercial that used that \"Pulp Fiction\" font as title cards. Gimme a break.Back to the main\npoint. Is Pulp Fiction a great movie? No. Is it good movie because it is entertaining? Yes. Is it an important movie?\nNo. Do I think it isnt an entertaining movie because of the violence and profanity? Quite the contrary, I dont think\nthat has anything to do with whether or not this movie is great or not. Pulp Fiction like myself, is a compost heap of\npop-culture references. The Simpsons are a full of pop culture references yet considered great. Shakespeare is full of\npop-culture references, but no one gives his work flak just because you have to open the OED to get half of it. I think\ntoo many people spend too much time dwelling on these obvious manifestations. I think the real reason Pulp Fiction is\nnot great, is because it does nothing to create characters who are metaphoric in any sense. They are there to serve very\none dimensional purposes on the screen. People praise Pulp Fiction for its structural elements, but for my money\nReservoir Dogs or a movie like Short Cuts did a better job of playing with narrative style. This brings me to Reservoir\nDogs, which I think is a great and important movie because it did alter the narrative telling in a totally different\nway. Though much of the story element is ripped off from a similar chinese movie about twelves thieves with an informer\nand a heist gone bad(I cant remember the name of it), Tarrantino tells the story differently than any filmmaker has\ntold before. Not only is the story non-linear, but if broken down into its treatment of time, it looks like someone\ntook a script chopped up into pieces, and then taped it back together randomly. Miraculously it all works. He also tells\nthe story like a drama for the stage, with long extended dialogue sequences, but yet he manages to not get that \"why did\nthey even bother putting on this film, because it looks exactly like a play\" look. (In the Company of Men, Oleanna)\nReservoir Dogs has all the violence and profanity of Pulp Fiction, but it also has depth to its characters.Tarrantino\nis a well educated filmmaker, in the sense that he knows his film history, and pays homage to great directors like\nTruffaut and Godard. Is Tarrantino a great director like them? No. In my mind he has made one truly great movie, and\ncouple of good movies, and a couple of duds. Tarrantino might be totally screwed, as he might be scorned for the very\nstyle he invented, the next time he comes around the mountain. True no one does Tarrrantino better than he does himself,\nbut do we really need or want it. Maybe thats why hes hanging out on broadway with Marisa Tomei, trying his shot at\nacting. Which by the way, he sucks at. But you know what, Ive never have made a body of work that comes close to what\nhe has managed to accomplish in such a short period of time.",

Be it the\ndialogue dealing with pop culture, in your face violent scenes or the new film noir look which Tarantino invented.  One\ncan appreciate this film for many reasons.  For one, Tarantino does not treat the audience like total idiots much the\nway most directors do.  He will let us judge things on our own and more importantly he does not attempt to save the\nworld.

    "reviewBody": "I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely\nirritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios\nalike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments\nof brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole \"Jules redemption-speech\" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the\nmidst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and\nmorbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional\ngenre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul\nunderneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown\nkiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional\ndedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincents unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural\nsalvation without realizing hes doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Juless final\nwords, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the\nflow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they\nare so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as\nthey individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, Im sure, have heard\nthe story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallaces neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back\nhis stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he cant deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes:\nescape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in\nsomething beyond ones own selfish world. I wont say that if you dont like this movie that youre mistaken or\nignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of\nprofanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.",

Personally I think this is one of the 5 best pictures ever made, both\nfrom a totally critical perspective and also from a more personal point of view since I think that Quentin is the best\nliving director/writer in the business.

Tarantino did an outstanding job at bringing a not that complex\nstory and everyday dialogue to the screen in one of the most enjoyable films ever.  On top of the brilliant story and\nwriting, there are the performances.  To start, Samuel L. Jackson gives the best performance I have ever seen on screen\nas Jules The Hitman.  His performance is memorible and some of the things he says and does is unforgettable.  Harvey\nKeitel is just as impressive as The Wolf.  The scene with Keitel, Jackson, Travolita and Tarantino in Jimmys house is\nclassic.  Pulp Fiction ranks among the best movies ever made and for good reason cause it is an absolute great movie and\nshould be cherished for years to come and I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this movie.  The dialogue is great\nand the way Tarantino split a basic story into 3 different parts is amazing.  **** out of 4 stars for Quentin\nTarantinos Pulp Fiction",

With the exception of Juless final\nwords, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the\nflow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they\nare so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as\nthey individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, Im sure, have heard\nthe story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallaces neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back\nhis stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he cant deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes:\nescape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in\nsomething beyond ones own selfish world. I wont say that if you dont like this movie that youre mistaken or\nignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of\nprofanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.",

    "reviewBody": "Well, I finally saw Pulp Fiction. Hadnt after all this time, but Ive heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented\nit.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didnt appreciate the art of this film, or its\nbrilliance, or any statement it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing\nabout, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in\ntime, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in\nediting or storytelling, it doesnt save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get\naway for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and\neven vaguely profound, but Kafka it aint. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel\nJackson, but cant Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a nicer guy, he comes off as a\nborderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hopes Eric Stoltz in there as a drug\ndealer.I worry about peoples minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption?\nGee... I didnt see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, Id hardly call that\nredemption, if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could\nhave opened up and swallowed the lot of em, and I would have applauded. People think its really cool or trendy to give\naccolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of em.",

The\nF-word is used well over 200 times, as are many other profanities.  The violence is graphic and brutal.  Theres also a\nbrief, almost totally off-screen homosexual rape scene.

    "reviewBody": "This movie is excellent.  Why?  Most importantly it is original.  It can be said, quite accurately, that many elements\nof this film have been stolen from other films.  No one can ever accuse Quentin Tarantino of not doing his homework\n(\"Repo Man\", or \"La Femme Nikita\" as obvious examples).  He even rips off much of his own material from \"Reservoir\nDogs\".  But the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original.Many people have\nstated that \"Pulp Fiction\" has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned.  Frankly, I dont think\nimitation proves anything, AND I dont think \"Pulp Fiction\" was imitated significantly more than many other highly\nsuccessful films.  However, to my mind, \"Pulp Fiction\" is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture\nicons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and\ninteresting.\"Pulp Fiction\" also has a few truly original moments.  Christopher Walkens wonderfully dry delivery of the\n\"Your father kept this watch in his ass for years\" story is hilarious.There is only one serious flaw in this film:\nQuentin Tarantino is a very poor actor.  Thank god he confined himself to a small role.  If he really feels the need to\nbe onscreen, he should just go ahead and pull a Hitchcockian cameo in his films. Sure its derivative, but at least his\nscreen presence will be minimized.",

Some bemoan the excessive amount of death and violence and general \"no way, thats just not real, could never\nhappen\" shenanigans -- they live in pretty neighborhoods, not backstreet *anywhere*.This movie is the treasure it is\nbecause of the incredible level of true grime and underbelly it shows in its treatment of the New Gangster. Fair\nwarning! Its not a pretty sight! This movie is for the same person that enjoys the speeding bullet, car-wrecking,\ngeneral riot and havoc type of film...But thats not all! We also see the return of John Travolta, and the meteoric\nSamuel Jackson! We hear dialogues that are not about backstory. Because they arent! Theyre *real* people, having\n*real* conversations. And that, my fellows, is one of the fabulous things. We get to go along for a ride with pushers\nand boxers and law-breakers and murderous rednecks. And thats just the first time you watch it.Wow.PS: This movie also\nfalls under the \"Inverse-Bruce\" Rule: A lot of Bruce Willis is not so good, but a little Bruce is incredible.PPS: Pulp\nFiction: Where its always 4:20 (unless its Seven Twenty-Two in the A.M., of course...)",

    "reviewTitle": "An Original Hollywood",
    "reviewBody": "Usually you will not find a film like \"Pulp Fiction\" come out of the highly formulaic realm of Hollywood.  That is\nprecisely why Pulp is so popular with audiences and critics, the time has come for a new breed of film within the\nindustry.  There are a number of elements which makes Pulp Fiction one of the best and most important films in\nHollywood.Something that is very original about Pulp Fiction is of course its structure.  It is both a narrative and\nnon-narrative film at the same time. Tarantino takes on the roles of a novelist and a filmmakers, simultaneously. He\ntells three stories instead of the conventional single story and they are told through a number of perspectives.  This\nmakes the film much more interesting than usual and it tightens the shared universe that all the characters dwell\nin.Tarantinos film is not meant to be a parody like many interpret it.  It is supposed to represent real-life.  The\nfilms structure is circular; the film ends where and when it began to represent the perpetual crisis of life, the\nunending conflicts that exist within the reality we live in.In fact, Tarantino emphases this point by attacking the\nHollywood interpretion of life and displaying a conflict and contrast within that. Tarantino stereotypes many elements\nof his film to that of the conventional Hollywood presentation.  He typifies the crime genre with his characters (2\nwashed-up hitmen, the crime boss, the crime bosss wife), their costumes (black, sullen), the violence, the death, the\ndrugs.  We see it all but then it is all twisted out of its conventional shape.  The hitmen do not talk like usual\nhitmen displayed on film.  They talk of TV pilots, toe massages and filthy animals.  And even though they start out in\nthe typical gangster situation with an assigned murder and retrieval of some goods, we then follow them for the rest of\nthe day, instead of abandoning that story right then and there.  We see conflicts and situations arise that are very\nunexpected and unusual for men such as these.  Both their language and situations are atypical of their stereotype.  We\nsee that people of this constructed, everyday world do not go through a formula of life, they experience life in a\nseemingly unplanned fashion, just like real-life.And when you look at Pulp Fiction nowadays, it has the very appealing\nretrospective ensemble cast.  What I mean by this is that now everyone in it is a big star but back in 1994, they\nwerent all that they are now.  John Travolta was wash-up and Pulp redeemed his career, Samuel L. Jackson was not well\nknown, Bruce Willis had come off a bunch of box-office bombs like The Bonfire of the Vanities and Mortal Thoughts, Uma\nwho?, Ving Rhames was a vitual unknown, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are purely creations of Quentin Tarantino, Eric\nStoltz was trapped in the 80s teenage genre.  In fact, Harvey Keitel was probably the only star but his character in the\nfilm was purely a creation of Hollywood and maintained that way throughout.  This film still has a lot of appeal when\nyou look at the cover box in a video story nowadays because it has this huge cast.Tarantinos direction is also not that\nlarger-than-life style that you are used to in a big Hollywood film.  He lets his actors live and really indulge into\ntheir characters.   He lets action take shape and remain on screen longer than would be expected such as Jules taking a\nlong sip from a Big Kahuna coke or Butch walking to his apartment to retrieve his gold watch.  He puts lots in the edges\nof the frame like the board games Operation and Life while Mia is about to get her adrenline shot.  He integrates\nsubliminal messages into his scene which take repeat and careful viewings to extract.  Pulp has so much, both on the\nsurface and within; much more than Hollywood is used to.When you watch Pulp Fiction, try to remove yourself from those\nwho feel they have to love it because everyone else does.  Love it for what it really has and for what you can really\nsee and feel.  Watch Pulp Fiction over and over, and with each viewing look for something new and you will find it.  You\nwill usually only find a film with any similar merit as Pulp Fiction in the realm of non-narrative, avant garde cinema.\nBut now that style has invaded Hollywood so take advantage of its genius and enter the world of fiction (but remember\nthat nothing is as it seems, maybe even the title).",

    "reviewBody": "Gen-x audiences, overstuffed by the yupped-out aesthetic of the Spielberg/John Hughes eighties, were dying for a soupcon\nof seventies grunge--something urban and gritty, but ironic and retro, to fit the cynical, beat-out, slackitudinous mood\nof the late George Bush era. Thats how Quentin Tarantino served his wake-up call to the world with RESERVOIR DOGS in\n1991, the alarm clock that jolted American cinemas eyes open after the long coma between BLUE VELVET and it. And PULP\nFICTION was the one that knocked the ball out of the park--commercially speaking. To find a cultural nerve-pinching\nphenomenon of similar force, youd have to go back to BONNIE AND CLYDE or EASY RIDER. But even they didnt have the\nseismic, global force of this movie: it may be hard to remember a few years later, but this picture, and its author,\nwere burned onto the public consciousness and referenced 24/7 for long, long after its release.Seen in retrospect, its\nclear what put the movie over--its like a smooth, upscale theme store stocked with gen-x fetish items (heroin! faded\nseventies icon! jherri curls! tongue-in-cheek machismo! Kool and the Gang! Fruit Brute!) that could make the most\nout-of-it yahoo feel like a hipster.Whats also clear is that its a logy, stilted, stagebound piece of work that\ndoesnt seem to take place in any lifelike universe, even a stylized one. The only rhythm the movie can claim is that of\na writer impressed with his ability to make coiled, jivy dialogue. Scenes drag on and on as Tarantino keeps on stylin.\nThe center section of the movie--a boxers romance with a French honeypie and his escape from a gangster hes\ndouble-crossed--is so thoroughly leaden and spontaneity-deprived youd think it wouldve been enough to sink the movie\nalone. But somehow the combination of the star-studded cast and the \"inside\"-y, you-can-be-hip feel of the picture made\nit a blockbuster of the calibre usually reserved for movies about skyscrapers or planets exploding.Sadly, Tarantino,\nafter a long, nail-biting hiatus, made his first genuinely great movie, JACKIE BROWN, which highlights all his strengths\nand eschews each of his flaws. All the fans who obsessed over the smallest minutiae of PULP greeted this impressive,\ngrown-up work with a shrug and a quick retreat.",

Well overall here are my\nratings...Acting- 4 / 5 Actors- 4 / 5 Script- 3 / 5 Display-4 / 5 Plot-   4 / 5 Performance - 3.5 / 5 Overall - 4 / 5B+",

    "reviewBody": "When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I said to my self, \"This is the most stupid movie I had ever seen.\" But then after\nwatching it four or five times, it was actually pretty good. I bought it because it was said to be one of the best films\never made, and it had great actors in it like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis\nand Christopher Walken. But when I watched it was very disappointed. I thought it was really stupid, and there was no\nplot to it. But then I watched it a couple more times, and I could see why a lot of people liked it. The main plot to it\nis the story of two hit-men (Travolta and Jackson). In the movie there are four different stories about these hit-men\nand there amazing adventures. This movie won the an Academy Award for The Best Oringinal Screenplay. So if you want to\nsee a fairly entertaining movie watch Pulp Fiction. If you would like to see a better film by Quentin Tarantino\n(Director of Pulp Fiction), see Jackie Brown. I would say it is much more entertaining.",

    "reviewBody": "Original doesn`t even begin to describe \"Pulp Fiction.\" How about \"ground-breaking\" or \"extremely innovative\". Being\nprobably one of the most distinctive films of the 1990`s, \"Pulp Fiction\" is an offbeat, gritty, but hysterically funny\nfilm about two hitmen, their boss, his crack-addicted wife, a boxer and a few eccentric but fascinating characters and\nand their bizarre stories. There are about 4 or 5 stories in this film (I can`t remember, I saw this a year ago), that\nall overlap each other, and they`re not in chronological order either. It sometimes can be confusing, but I`m sure\nyou`ll be able to understand it. The script for this film is sheer genius, as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, the\ntwo hitmen, argue about everything from Big Macs to shooting someone in the back of their car. Uma Thurman is radiant as\nthe unconventional, junkie who likes to dance and crack silly jokes. \"Pulp Fiction\" doesn`t really have a plot, it sort\nof like a collection of a few stories, that don`t really go anywhere. There a few bloody moments, but you`ll be laughing\nhysterically, it`s THAT MUCH of a black comedy. The film`s low budget is very visible, but that just creates an even\nmore raw atmosphere. \"Pulp Fiction\" is not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy an outrageously funny, startlingly\noriginal and dark film, this is for you.",

    "reviewBody": "If this film isnt making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private, candid conversation,\nthen its knocking you on your butt, flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing\nturn in editing schematic. Unless of course, youre my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop\nwatching. I remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking Id just seen something amazing and that Id\nnever seen anything like it before.I still remember the riveting, tense feeling I had when Butch, played by Bruce Willis\ndecides to go back for his fathers gold watch at his apartment, certain that gangsters like John Travoltas Vincent\nVega are looking for him. The long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense, as\nyou got the feeling the man was walking into certain death. And then the moment he thinks everything is fine, he decides\nto toast a pop tart. I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. And later still, when you think everything\nis fine again, youre floored by another predicament.The only time this sort of experience works in my opinion, is when\nyou see a good movie for the first time in a theater. Naturally, the second time round does not produce the same kind of\ntension, unless of course you suffer from amnesia and dont remember what happens. But what Im getting at is the\nrelationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video.For me, Pulp Fiction is just one example of\nmany where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environment.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies of the decade and a testament to the genius of Quentin Tarantino. Building on\nthe success of his debut, Resevoir Dogs, Tarantino delivers a superbly-scripted, masterfully-directed, crime epic. Three\nstories (created by Tarantino and Roger Avery) are intertwined through the film and it unfolds, much like Reservoir\nDogs, out of chronological order. The film was criticised by many as being too violent, although by modern standards I\nthink it is rather tame. The violent scenes are directed and acted so well, however, that they stick in the viewers\nmind long after watching the movie. I am convinced that there is a spiritual level to the movie and the theme of\nredemption is a very strong one; the film finishes with Juless decision to leave the violent lifestyle, although this\ndecision is not chronologically at the end of the story. And the mysterious bright glow from Marcelluss briefcase will\ncertainly leave you wondering about unearthly elements in the film. A strong cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L\nJackson and Bruce Willis, certifies this film as a true classic.",

    "reviewBody": "Well, it rocks, I guess. It jumps. It moves. Its flashy and clever. The acting is excellent. The direction is\ninteresting... I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence,\nbut the power. How much they love the fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.Uma Thurman\nis just decadently sexy. John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a \"low-rent\" hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a\nprize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on\nhimself-seems right! How come they never did that before: they probably did, I just missed it.). Samuel Jackson is\ninteresting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are\nalmost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood. We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys. The pro-mos for\ncigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however. A Hollywood movie, a commercial\nflick, is always a clich. The art part comes from doing spins on the clich, in putting a new twist on the old bull****,\non the old standards. Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman. Hes shot\nheroin, shes done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes\nand vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers. Poor Hollywood. Theyve done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat,\nsalt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence. If your life span is only sixteen to about\nthirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight. Cocaine and\ncigarettes cant hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.(Note: Over 500 of my\nmovie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Cant Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it\nat Amazon!)",

Yet others took the\nbizarre line that no film should be made about such worthless characters. Yet others called it plotless and\nformless. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the \"pulp fiction  on\nwhich it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues.\nTarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.To\nmake my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its\nthree  episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied\ncoolness in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his\nprofoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption.",

The whole\nendless date scene between Travolta and Thurman? The stupid dance contest? Couldnt wait for it to end. And the ending\nof the date was just as useless.Then the whole long dragged-out sequence with Bruce Willis...I just kept thinking, who\ncares? Then the senseless rape sequence. It gets worse!Then the whole *hour* it seems we spend in that diner at the end.\nI dont know, it just didnt do it for me. The accidental shooting bit was ok at first, but then it too got dragged out\nand boring. Quentin Tarrantino should never again appear in one of his movies. He, quite succinctly, sucks as an actor\n(and he aint much of a director, IMHO. Hes the one responsible for keeping the movie moving (heh!) and it\ndra-a-a-a-ags...)To sum up, this is almost three hours of mostly boring crapola punctuated by a few\nshootings/interesting events and even fewer really funny moments. On the upside, Samuel Jacksons portrayal of a truly\nterrifying Bible-quotin gangster was great...up until his \"epiphany.\" Hes the only one that deserved an award on this\none. I never bought Travolta as a hitman. Thurman is way more sexy in her mind than in fact.All-in-all, an average\neffort from the Hollywood grist mill, certainly not the earthshattering event its made out to be. Lock Stock and Two\nSmoking Barrels has been described as a PF wannabe, but for my money, LS2SB is 100% more funny and imaginative, the\nplot is way better and ties up in much more unexpected ways, and is overall a much better film.And I sat down to watch\nthis movie wanting to like it.

    "reviewTitle": "**** (Out of four)",
    "reviewBody": "This is filmmaking at its apex.  Though I would hardly argue that this film is the greatest, which is what many IMDB\nusers relate after theyve just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next \"Titanic\" or \"Matrix\"\nhype machine bursts their way, I must say that \"Pulp Fiction\" added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other\nfilm of the 90s. And who can argue with that? Indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things\nby-the-book, and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldnt be more\nright.  When the film came out, a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipness...Being hip is cool,\nbut I wouldnt necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at \"Men in Black\", which was sorta fun but hardly\nthe endurable piece of cinema that \"Pulp Fiction\" has become. So what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd?  Its\nexactly this spirituality...watching the film, I remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time, being\nunbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird California former video clerks world view.\nThe film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style; one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both\nthe fast-paced unbreaking style of Scorseses \"Goodfellas\" and Roman Polanskis \"Rosemarys Baby\".  It is the scene\nwhere Travolta crashes his Malibu into Eric Stoltzs front yard and brings the ODed Thurman inside his house.  As\nRosanna Arquette hurls invectives at the two, the camera (wonderful work by Andrez Sekula moves back and forth between\nArquette and Travolta and Stoltz lurching over Thurman (thats the Scorsese part).  Then, as Stoltz goes looking for the\nplunger, the camera follows him into a room, where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of\nStoltz, reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in \"Rosemarys Baby\" by placing an obstruction\nbetween her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side, making a hopeless attempt\nto see around the obstruction.  Such a phrase can be used to describe \"Pulp Fiction\": most movies simply unfurl their\nstories at the audience.  This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action.  I recently had a semi-argument with a\nfriend over the worth of this film over \"Natural Born Killers\".  Now dont get me wrong, Oliver Stone is a powerful\nfilmmaker, but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like \"Im Going to Use my Artistic License to\nSatirize the Over-the-Top Violence of Popular Culture by Making a Movie Replete With...Over-the-Top Violence!\"  In the\nstyle of David Spade, \"Its called hypocrisy, Oliver--check into it!\"  Anyways, I digress.  Anybody who bad-mouths this\nmovie indeed has no appreciation for cinema; sure, the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere , but\nTarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema.  You can say that the films tone didnt impress you,\nthat its style wasnt to your taste...but you cant deny the artistry that went into it.  Morality? For all of those who\nbelieve this film is an amoral travesty, I suggest you rent the family favorite \"The Santa Clause\" and count how many\ntimes Disney shamelessly milks its own products, or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas\nfilm.  Or in ANY family film.  What impressed me the most when I first saw \"Pulp Fiction\" was its inclusion of God at\nall, many Generation-X filmmakers (paging Kevin Smith?) are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to\nsee one that painted divinity in such a positive light. You can have those other indie favorites \"Chasing Amy\" and \"Good\nWill Hunting\"(both starring those irritating crybabies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), and if you like those cynical films\nwhich are basically reworkings of \"oh-feel-sorry-for-me\" melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating\nalternative rock (best summed up by the Smashing Pumpkins in a \"Simpsons\" episode: \"Alls we got is our millions of\ndollars, our legions of fans, and our youth.\"), then you can have them. Compare that to Jules awakening (\"I was just\nsitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.\") and\nyoull see how Tarantino turned the mythic Gen-X stereotype on its head as well. \"Pulp Fiction\" is, in my opinion, the\nking of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever.",

    "reviewBody": "To lend myself to the cliche, Tarantino has revolutionized cinema.  Some praise him, some berate him, some despise him,\nand quite a few lose sight of what he has brought into the mainstream.  In this, his best work to date, Tarantino\nsucceeds in telling one of the most realistic tales ever to find its way into theaters.  It is this realism that makes\nTarantino so impressive a director.  While epics like Braveheart and Titanic concern themselves with the most noble\npoints of human existence and morbid thrillers such as Se7en focus on the lowest depths of depravity, Pulp Fiction\ninstead stays firmly in the middle ground of daily experience. The film has been criticized as glorifying violence and\ndrug use.  Instead I feel this movie simply portrays such facets of society, and portrays them very similarly to the\n\"real world.\"  Pulp Fiction, along with Tarantinos other films, is so captivating because the characters are so very\nhuman, more than a collection of catch phrases and a cool exterior.  Tarantino offsets this stark realism with offset\nchronology, drawing the audience in even further by making them fit the pieces of the plot together in their minds.\nGranted, Tarantino was not the first to use the directorial techniques that make Pulp Fiction a fantastic story.  He did\nnot use them first, but he has used them best.  He is so good at what he does that Pulp Fiction is a great movie despite\nhis own acting.  That alone is worthy of an Oscar.",

Great performances abound, but it is Samuel L. Jacksons pre-Jedi Master\nperformance as the spiritually inclined Jules that truly makes this film terrific to watch.  Also a treat are Ving\nRhames and Harvey Kietel as the Wolf.  When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I wasnt impressed, but the second time, I\nrealized what a good time I had watching it.

If you really want to enjoy it youll probably have to see it three times or more.\nIf youre not planning on doing this, dont watch it! Then of course theres the mystery behind Pulp Fiction.

Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve\nBuscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on\nmy all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREES COMPANY reruns have better\ndialogue (and I hate that show). Its such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in\nmovies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all\nthree departments miserably.",

    "reviewBody": "PULP FICTION is indeed one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. It starts out in a diner where a man and a woman\n(Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discuss armed robberies. The story is then broken off into three distinct strands: the\ndate between a hit man (John Travolta) and his bosss wife (Uma Thurman), an over-the-hill boxer (Bruce Willis) on the\nrun, and the clean-up of a hit mans mistake. The film returns to the diner scene for its ending sequence.If you saw\nQuentin Tarantinos first (and better) film, RESERVOIR DOGS, you should have no problem following the events of PULP\nFICTION, which are not told in chronological order.The performances in the film are outstanding, namely by John\nTravolta, who shines as tough guy hit man, Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant as Vinces partner,\nJules Winfield, who reads a bible passage before he kills his next unsuspecting victim.Another strong point in the film\nwas the good writing, which was also strong in RESERVOIR DOGS.Despite the fact that the film produces one of the\ngrossest scenes I have ever witnessed in a film and a slow-moving middle, PULP FICTION still remains a damn good film,\nsnubbed by the Academy when Oscar time rolled around in 1995. Samuel L. Jackson was well deserving of an Oscar for Best\nSupporting Actor. The film did win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, although. GRADE: A-",

    "reviewBody": "One of the best independent film ever made, Pulp Fiction is a towering achievement while not really being any good at\nall. It is a dirty, edgy film which is essentially about nothing other than what it feels like to be in this situation.\nIt is reminiscent of Goodfellas, which has that same almost documentary-like feel to it, and has no definable plot.At\nthe centre of this film however is the acting. Quentin Tarantino draws every ounce of life out of each character and\ncreates an endless series of freaks that you would love to study , but would never want to know. A lot of talk\nsurrounded John Travoltas Oscar loss in this film to Tom Hanks, but it was Samuel L. Jackson who was robbed. He eats\nthe screen alive in every scene - the most famous being in the diner at the end but the best being the hit on Brett\n(\"Check out the big brain on Brett\") in the first scene after the credits. Even Bruce Willis fits his role as a scheming\nlow-life boxer perfectly.The non-linear story telling and campy feel to this movie work, and make it come across like a\ncrude mating of a 70s cop show, blaxpoitation and a soap opera. But the sharp, witty, original and daring screenplay\nnever misses its target and not a single scene comes off as forced or awkward.The violence in this movie got a lot of\nattention at its release, but you cannot convince me that it has anything worse than an episode of NYPD Blue. It really\nis not that violent. The scenes with Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and \"the gimp\" are truly offensive and tough to watch,\nbut they are not that violent. That being said, the f-shots in this movie are countless.When you first view Pulp\nFiction, so much is thrown at you in such an unconventional way that you may well dislike the film. Give it a second or\neven third chance. It is well worth it. Pay close attention to the cameos - they make the film. **** out of ****.",

Im not even talking about Tarantino (even though I feel this is his\nbest.) Watch how many details the actors put into their roles, the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue\nsizzle. Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman are obvious standouts, and Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel are also quite good.\nChristopher Walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history.

    "reviewBody": "I was reading some of these posts and decided to put in my two cents worth on the Pulp debate.  Someone stated that they\nhad just seen the movie (in 1999, five years after its release) and could not understand the hype. Well, therein lies\nthe greatest problem facing a film like Pulp Fiction: everything novel and unique it brought to the cinema five years\nago has been utterly ransacked by the Hollywood mainstream.  Anyone who saw a film like Bonnie  Clyde 30 years ago will\nsay what an impact the film made on them, when today it seems only like a well constructed gangster film.  Pulp Fiction\nalready seems a little dated because we keep seeing these characters and situations appearing on film.  Sure some of\nwhat Tarantino did had been done before.  Wed seen rampant drug use in Drugstore Cowboy, and gangster black comedy in\nGoodfellas, but Tarantino successfully mixed the dark subject matter with hipness for the nineties, and thusly created\nthe film, and the film revolution that true film lovers had been waiting years for. Pulp Fiction trampled the Hollywood\nblockbuster industry (remember this was the year of Forrest Gump) and sent studios running to Sundance to find the next\nbig thing.  People who look at Pulp Fiction years after its release are going to have the same reaction one would have\nafter listening to, say, Nirvanas Nevermind:  \"Its good, but I dont get the fuss.\"  Of course you dont.  You have to\nbe there from the beginning to realize just how much of an impact these artists had on EVERYTHING we see and hear today.\nPeople who call Pulp Fiction the greatest film of all time are probably in need of an introduction to a few more films.\nPulp Fiction is not the greatest film ever made.  It is however, the most important film of our generation.",

This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must\nsay though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee,\nit is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the\nmovie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic\nexperience but doesnt necessarily make for a good film. But it isnt so much the action itself as much as the language\nwhich achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were\nunnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might\ntry. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the\ndirectorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake). In all I ended up with\nrather mixed feelings about this movie. My vote 7/10",

    "reviewBody": "\"You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?\" Its inane, but its entertaining and it sure seems\nwitty when theyre saying it, especially when you learn that this conversation is occurring on the way to knock off a\ngroup of possibly armed drug dealers. This is the casual manner in which you would like to talk with your friends and\nco-workers just before the big event goes down. This is dialogue that makes you feel hip just listening to it.Forget the\nsalvation and redemption bit, this movie is all about making you feel hip. You feel hip when you get to listen in on the\nclever repartee, hip when you can be titillated by the gratuitous violence but still act blas about it, hip when the\nsudden time jump doesnt bother you in the least. This movie makes you feel more hip then any other which has been made\nin quite a long time.Look beneath the hip surface, however, and youre left with little more than violence as\nentertainment. Violence in movies works best when used as a necessary device to support the plot, characters, and\nmessage. Tarantino reverses this relationship, creating plot and characters purely to support an entertaining sequence\nof violent situations. Each act of violence has its own specific purpose - make us laugh, make us jump, make us cheer,\ngive us a vicarious thrill - and Tarantino is extremely skilled at making this work. This is the greatest strength of\n\"Pulp Fiction\", but ultimately its greatest weakness as well.The out-of-sequence scene demonstrates the extent to which\nthe creation of entertaining violence was the driving force of the production. No doubt this was originally intended to\nbe seen in its proper sequence but had to be removed because not only does it add nothing to the plot and character\ndevelopment, it actually bogs things down and gets in the way. Not wanting to lose his biggest laughs, however,\nTarantino simply sticks it on the end and has the added bonus of now having a non-traditional narrative simple enough to\nnot confuse his audience but sufficient to make them feel hip for being able to \"appreciate\" it.Is being hip enough? Not\nto be a classic, at least not in this case. Almost any hip movie is going to be firmly rooted in its own time period,\nbut \"Pulp Fiction\" has lost it much more quickly than others. Although very entertaining and memorable in the initial\nviewing, its appeal fades quickly. When the hipness is gone, theres nothing left but violence, which doesnt make for a\nvery pleasant viewing experience. Hip classics such as \"Oceans Eleven\" and \"Goldfinger\" stay classics because they\nstill give us fun and adventure even after the hipness has turned to camp. \"Pulp Fiction\" just gets ugly with time.\nGuns, drugs, and a couple hillbillies right out of \"Deliverance\" arent enough to make a classic film.",

    "reviewBody": "I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers\nare our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing\nscenes as countless murders, SM rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (its a wonder Six Flags hasnt\nopened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters\ndoing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man\nwas accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is how will we clean out the car?\nWhat can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who\nfinds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they\ninflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as\nthe good guys. If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldnt\nit--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?",

I dont\nbelieve all that is said about how it revolutionised  film making or that it is the most important film of the (my)\ngeneration (and I did see it in the cinema at the time of its release).There are many superb scenes in the film but for\nme, it is neither as exceptional nor shocking as Reservoir Dogs.I suppose this generation is pretty unshockable as far\nas what is seen on screen is concerned, although this film does have a couple of moments that almost truly shock.  So\nlong as youre over 18 and mentally sound then I recommend it but really, it is only a film after all, if its a\nstatement of our times, it is only one mans statement (to which of course hes perfectly entitled).",

This is one of the funniest, most enjoyable two hours Ive ever spent in a\ntheater.  I went into it halfway expecting not to like it, and I came out a rabid fan.  Samuel L. Jackson is the finest\nactor in film today, and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map.  Not to mention jump-starting the career\nof John Travolta! Sure, theres lots of violence and profanity--but thats what makes the movie!  Im not one of those\ndie-hard Tarantino fans either. (I hated \"Reservoir Dogs\".  Ugh!) My other favorite movie, along with this one, is \"When\nHarry Met Sally\"! Hows that for diversity? I dont understand how anyone could NOT like this movie. Its been imitated\nmany times since, but when it came out it was very different than anything else that had been done. If you find it hard\nto follow the first time, watch it again.  Youll understand the back-and-forth-in-time concept then. Every performance\nin it was great--and it has many lines that will be quoted for years to come.  I couldve done without Ving Rhames rape\nscene, but other than that, it was perfect. 5 out of 5 stars!",

Many have said it was John Travoltas greatest film, they missed the mark there also.  Tarantino had a web site\nabout the same time the movie was released to explain to the viewers the nuances of his film.  It was really about\nsaving many peoples souls, that is what was in the black briefcase.  I see films like this and all I can think is that\nthe writer got wasted and wrote down his great ideas while he was wasted.

The\nmovie did not go in chronological order and that was fresh and original.  The acting was good,    Uma Thrurman short on\nscreen role was very moving and her on screen time had the most disturbing image of the entire film with her overdosing.\nI was surprised that John Travolta was nominated  for an Oscar because he can act better than what he did in this\nfilm(Face Off), he was good but it wasnt special,  it was his usual self.  As for all the talk of redemption...,I think\nits kind of a crock,  I mean Samuel L Jacksons character is probaly not all that reliable.     The humour--it didnt\nwork and it wasnt funny.    The people pretty much fit their roles and the movie and sountrack was good,  but I dont\nreally see the big deal of it.

With so many lines which will be repeated long after you see\nthis movie, it is pretty much an instant classic.Ive seen Pulp Fiction more times than I can count (Probably about 50)\nand its the only film that I can still get joy out of after seeing it that many times. I was terribly confused as to\nwhat transpired the first time I saw it, but then after a few more viewings I began to realize the genius in this film\nisnt that Tarantino makes the viewer understand the film, he makes the viewer love it. From the \"Big brain on Brad\"\nscene until the \"Bad Mother F--ker\" scene, this movie aims to please. In that sense it is probably the anti-classic, but\nsince we already have a surplus of sex, drugs, and violence in film and on television why not just roll them all into\none, multiply by one hundred, and make a movie out of it.Unfortunately this will probably be Tarantinos last great film\njudging from the pathetic aftershock which turned out to be Jackie Brown.",

    "reviewBody": "Geoffrey Chaucers \"Canterbury Tales\" was a frame story:  there was one overall story/link that binded all the\ncharacters (they met at the inn on the road) which is at the beginning and end of the story but in between are\nmini-stories about each of the travellers.  \"Pulp Fiction\" is a modern version.  The frame in this case is the Diner\nwhich is where, like Chaucers inn, the main characters meet.  In between we get mini-storys like Butchs tale (the\nKnight if you will), Vincents tale (the Sailor) and Jules tale (the Monk).  Each is interwoven with the other except\nthat chronologically, they are out of synch (Butch wastes Vincent in his tale but Vincent is in the Diner frame part of\nthe story).  The dialog is sharp and has some serious hidden meanings at times--Tarintino is notorious, like Stephen\nKing, for lacing the dialog with pop-culture references.  Witness the scene outside Jack Rabbit Slims where Mia asks\nVincent \"Youre not a square Daddy-O are you?\" and proceeds to \"draw\" a square in the air ala Pebbles Flintstone.  This\nblurring of the films reality with our reality lets you know Tarintino is not some by the books director with no sense\nof what \"Joe Bagofdonuts\" does--he watches TV too!  Kevin Williamsons re-writing of the horror film rules owes alot to\n\"Pulp Fiction\" and its acknowledgement of just who is going to see movies these days.

    "reviewBody": "Most people I know who have seen this movie either think its the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever\nproduced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually\nkind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.\nStill, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only\nthe one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done\nwithout, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the \"story\" meanders and seems largely without purpose.\nDespite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what theyre in for, and\ndont just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they dont get it, they tend\nto over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of\nthe 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark\nhumor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Dont watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2\nhours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it\non Showcase- that channel is great for films they cant show on the networks without such severe editing that part of\nthe story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at\ntaking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I dont know\nhow many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things,\ninstead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the\nworkings of the human mind.",

John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames\nare also in on the action. This film is excellent in many ways. The dialogue is snappy and sharp, the acting is\nbrilliant and the story is so clever. Basically, the whole story is based around a crime boss(Rhames) and his mysterious\nbrief case. We start off the film with Mr Roth and his partner robbing a diner, and from that moment on, the audience\ncan sit back and stare in amazement at the talent shown on screen. All the stars give a career best. There are superb\nconfrontations between the actors-Mr Rhames and Mr Willis, Mr Jackson and Mr Roth, Mr Willis and Mr Travolta, Mr\nTravolta and Ms.Thurman, Mr Keitel and Mr Tarantino and Mr Jackson and Mr Travolta. It leaves the audience wondering who\nknows who and for what reason. Its the exact intelligence that made Jackie Brown so tremendous. Rating=5/5",

Early trailers showing a movie\nwith a huge cast, sex, drugs, and violence from a director who made an earlier hit and an underground genre as its\nsubject.2.  After the trailer, it will respectively draw people in like sheep to see it.3. Sooner or later, theres a\ncontroversy about the movies content, and yet it is still being raved about. Sooner or later the Academy of Motion\npictures will knock on the directors door based on the amount  of sheep-people who love it.  It becomes a classic, and\nto those rare cases of actual humanoid lifeforms like myself, its a hoopla B.S.Essentially, its the hype that made\nthis movie. If a film student approached a producer with the same idea, hed get the hand. If youre Quentin Tarantino,\nyoud get Caviar and a warm welcome.  First of all, I didnt care for any one these characters. And wheres the plot?\nOoh, who needs one? Just turn these con men into philosophy majors, and have them drive around using four letter words\nall the time. Then make a bunch of vignettes out of this \"plot\"! Someone gets a big needle poked through their chest\nbecause they overdosed on cocaine! Ooh, shocking! Pump up the hype! They took the scientologist star of Saturday Night\nFever and made him disco dance again! With Uma Thurman yet! Some shocking stuff here! But what does it all mean? Is it\nsupposed to prove that even the most sleazy  people are smart and intelligent? Does it mean rape in a VCR repair store\ncould be a hype getter in another movie? Could it mean that the \"N\" word is okay to use as long as your name is Quentin\nTarantino and youre just making a movie?The emperor has no clothes. Or is it the hitman has no clothes?

Plus, he added everything in it that was necessary without overdoing anything.  Sure some of the scenes are\nrough but there isnt a scene in the movie where you can say \"Well thats a little too much\" unless you hate violence.\nBut what is great about this movie as well is that Tarantino somewhat copied Hitchcock (Be forewarned, Im giving away\nsome scenes in the movie so if you havent seen it, skip this part, read the last paragraph and read this after youve\nseen it.  However, if you dont mind having a few scenes spoiled before seeing the movie, go ahead, be my guest and read\nthis).When Travolta stabs Uma Thurman with the needle, Tarantino did like Hitchcock used to do: He makes you think its\ngoing to be very gory and sick but there isnt a drop of blood.When Ving Rhames crosses the street, stares at Bruce\nWillis, curses at him and then gets run over by Bruce Willis, Tarantino copied a little the scene in \"Psycho\" when Janet\nLeighs boss crosses the street and sees her in her car when he thinks shes home resting.  So, this said, the movie is\nreally great.  Personally, I felt that Travolta should have won the Oscar for best actor that year instead of Tom Hanks\nin \"Forrest Gump\".

    "reviewBody": "Quentin Tarantino writes the best dialogue of any director, ever. I know this is only early in his career but  the\ndialogue content of the film ranks it certainly as the best of the 90s and up there with anything else. The characters\nare believable in every sense, motion, speech, action and consequences of their action. The non linear plot makes its\ncontent work regardless of the dialogue. Also contains the revival of John Travolta as a Hollywood force and Samuel L\nJackson best ever perfomance. An outstanding social commentary and altogether fantastic film. You must see this.",

John Travoltas performance was good but\ncould not beat Samuel L Jacksons portrayal of Jules, the hitman.I liked the scenes being presented asynchronously,\ngiving the sense of peoples worlds being connected but they, the characters, not really being aware of the\ninterconnectivity of their lives (roles).The violence in the movie is not gratuitous (hope Im using this word\ncorrectly) ... the car scene was especially good as was the cleaning of the car scene ... dialogue excellent ... and\ngetting \"medieval on your ass\" will forever be with us ... also \"going over this neighborhood with a blow torch and a\npliers\" ...What I also liked was the realism of the movie ... I mean no cops around when you need them ... in another\nmovie the screen would have been swamped by blue and whites but not here ... just pure unadulterated violence ...",

That didnt stop me from enjoying it though.Pulp Fiction weaves three\ncharacter-related stories together. Each story is fairly unremarkable and couldnt sustain a feature but its the\nfabulous dialogue and the actors delivery that makes it entertaining.\nJohn Travolta is great as Vincent Vega. He gets to play a large part in the first and final stories and has a cameo in\nthe second. He oozes class as Samuel L Jacksons partner and delivers his lines like their his own words. Bruce Willis\nproves to be more than just an action hero with a less explosive but still vest wearing part. Uma Thurman pulls off a\nsmall but impressive performance. Harvey Keitel and Eric Stoltz have the best cameo roles and Quentin Tarantino isnt\nbad as Jimmy.But this film belongs to Jackson. He lights up the screen whether hes quoting from the Bible or eating a\nhamburger. He was born for his part. The three stories should have been all about him.There isnt much more to be said.\nWe all know Quentin Tarantino can write (True Romance) and we know he can direct (Reservoir Dogs). Lets hope theres a\nfew more characters still lurking in that sick head of his.",

    "reviewBody": "I dont have enough space here to point out all of the misconceptions about Pulp Fiction so Ill just give everybody my\ntake on the film and its message. Pulp Fiction is a truly brilliant film that few people will ever completely\nunderstand. Pulp Fiction covers everything from social satire to morality to just good old fashion movie fun. First of\nall I would like to explain the bible verse that Jules reads (Ezekeil 25:17) and how it applies to the story. Jules is\n\"the righteous man\", Vincent is \"the selfish\", and Marsellus represents \"the tyranny of evil men.\" Jules is \"beset on\nall sides\" by this negativity and must find it in himself to overcome it. Jules, in the end finds redemption, where\nVince and Marsellus have the vengance of the lord layed upon them for their sins. This is just one layer of a great\nstory. Perhaps thats the brilliance of Pulp Fiction: the various layers that the film can be enjoyed on. Pulp Fiction\nis the Citizen Kane of the 90s....It has changed filmaking like few others. The acting in Pulp Fiction makes it seem\nlike the actors were just born to play their roles in the movie. Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson give a couple of the\nfinest performances in screen history. The Social satire and Quentins great direction only fuel the fire. Its just too\nbad that the subject matter of the film turn people away from Pulp Fiction, because those people are really restricting\nthemselves. Pulp Fiction is my all-tie favorite film and I believe that in 10 or 15 years it will go down as the\ngreatest film ever made. 10 out of 10",

    "reviewTitle": "The appeal of this movie escapes me",
    "reviewBody": "This oddly intertwined series of tales is chiefly about two professional assassins, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and\nJules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and their misadventures in the world of murder, crime, and taking the bosss wife\nout to eat.  (Trust me, this is not as funny as it sounds). Haphazardly intermixed with this is the story of the boss,\nMarsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and of Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for Wallace and thus\nearns his enmity.Some things are not wrong with PULP FICTION.  I do not believe, as some do, that it is intended to\nglorify violence and drug abuse.  It does play both these things for comic effect, in what I found a very tasteless,\nvulgar, and unfunny style, but I dont think Tarantino was trying to tell the audience that violence and drug abuse are\nactually fun and beneficial; inconvenient and inglorious consequences of both are shown quite graphically.  And the\nacting by Jackson, Rhames, and, yes, Willis is pretty darn good.Nevertheless, PULP FICTION bored me out of my mind.  I\nwas not interested in the characters, because none of them is sympathetic; none feels about the world or reacts to it in\nany way remotely approaching my own.  And much of the movie is spent in long dialogue that does nothing to advance the\nplot. To be fair, Tarantino does have an ear for realistic, earthy-sounding phrases.  The lines never sound artificial,\nforced or strained; they do sound just like the spontaneous banalities that form the backbone of real peoples\nconversations.  But I dont listen to strangers banal conversations, because theyre boring if I dont know the people.\nAnd thats exactly how boring the conversations in PULP FICTION are.PULP FICTIONs genius is generally said to lie in\nits accomplishments as a black comedy.  Well, whatever floats your boat.  I got very few laughs out of this picture.\nInterestingly, I always find my friends re-enactments of their favorite scenes from PULP FICTION to be much funnier\nthan seeing the scenes themselves.  I was amused twice in the final tale by Tarantinos spoofing of movie cliches, as\nwhere Jules urged Honeybunny to \"stay calm, point the gun at me,\" and where a hapless gunman misses Jules and Vincent\nwith an entire magazine at point blank range, much to all parties amazement.  But aside from that, the comedy eluded\nme.  I dont know how anyone could hail lower than lowbrow humor like Christopher Walkens scene as being some kind of\ncomic genius.  Furthermore, realistically brutal violence and comedy dont mix well for my taste.Tarantino does have\nsome imagination handling the camera.  For instance, Vincent at one point is told that Marsellus Wallace had a man\nthrown off a building for massaging Mrs. Wallaces feet; later, when Vincent meets Mrs. Wallace on orders to take her to\na restaurant, the camera never leaves Mrs. Wallaces feet.But Tarantinos imagination often is no more than showing off.\nThe films structure appeals to the sort of over-literate viewer for whom the word \"nonlinear\" is synonymous with\n\"brilliant\" and \"artistic.\"  Not to be a spoilsport, but theres a good reason most movie scripts are arranged in a\nlinear fashion: that happens to be the way time flows.  Im not saying you cant tell a good nonlinear story, but\nthered better be a reason for it. And I cannot tell what Tarantino thinks he accomplished by mixing at least five\n(counting the opening scene) different time sequences together in a seemingly random order.  I was not confused, but\nmany others were, and I dont see what Tarantino gained in exchange for losing them.  One reviewer has suggested this\ndevice enabled Tarantino to put Jules \"redemption\" at the end, thus finishing the movie on a positive note.  If this is\nso, then the conclusion is just as manipulative and intellectually dishonest as any standard tacked-on Hollywood\nfeel-good ending.Not that the ending is really bad; in fact I gave the movie an extra half star for its ending, as I\nfinally became interested in one of the characters.  I would have liked to find out whether Jules succeeded in leaving\nthe criminal life.  Of course, I take self-confessed \"redemptions\" with a grain of salt, but since Jules seems to be\nuncertain himself about whether hell kick the criminal habit, I can live with that.  But redeemed or not, Jackson\ncouldnt completely redeem this frequently tedious, sometimes nauseating, and rarely funny two and a half hours.Rating:\n** out of ****.",

Someone died, and I didnt like any of the characters, with the exception of\nWhaleys, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being \"cool\" and trying to have\n\"catch phrases,\" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when\nviolent, immoral films are regarded as \"daring\" \"good\" film making. This one sure wasnt, and nominating John Travolta\nand Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act,\nbut the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and\n\"Do the Right Thing\" for my least favorite \"good\" movie.",

    "reviewBody": "Warning: does contain spoilers.Before I go into how great this film is, I have to first tell you something that I know\neveryone thinks but so few have commented on, and that is the performance of Ving Rhames.  For those of you that have\nseen this film, you all know what I am going to say is the gospel, for those of you that havent, if you ever see a film\nfor a singular performance, see two films. One is Tombstone because of Val Kilmer and the other is Pulp Fiction for\nRhames.  His portrayal of Marcellus Wallace is one of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures.  His\nmannerisms, his dialect, his virility, his coolness and his ruthlessness all should have given him the Best Supporting\nActor Oscar that year, even over Samuel Jackson.  Just think back to some of this lines, some of his actions and some of\nhis facial expressions.  This is the epitome of greatness and if I could pick 5 performances in the history of film that\nare the embodiment of powerful interpretations and believability, this would easily be up there. Just look at the scene\nwhen Jules talks to him after the Marvin problem. Jules is freaking out and Wallace calmly responds \" Im on the\nm*****f***a, go back inside and chill them niggas out, Im sending in tha Wolf. \"  As he delivers the line he is\nserenely sitting in his backyard with his cool shades covering his malicious eyes and he is wiping his mouth with an\nexpensive hanky.  His delivery is perfect and when you listen to him you dont think this is a ruthless killer, he is\njust a guy next door with a very nice house.  And what makes it even better is that they are two gangsters talking about\nalleviating the Bonnie situation before she gets home.  These are two bad ass criminals that are in the business of\nkilling people and they are attempting to save a mans marriage by removing a dead body from the garage.  That is just\ndripping with contradictions, but it works because of the writing and because of the delivery, mostly by Rhames. Another\nscene that demonstrates his grasp of his character is the rape scene.  When he finally gets around to his comeuppance\nagainst \" Billy Boy \", he spits out his dialogue with such venom that while you are cheering his triumph, you are\nactually worried for Zed and his soon-to-be-living-his-shortass-life-in-agonizing-pain-rapist situation.  And then when\nhe talks to Butch, he is fair and thankful for Butchs assistance but cannot forget how Butch betrayed him.  \" Oh that\nwhat now.  Ill tell you what now.  There is no me and you.  You leave town tonight and when you be gone you stay gone.\nYou lost all your L.A. privledges. \"  Ving Rhames is my favourite part of the film ( besides the ridiculously\nintelligent and original script ) and quoting him is now a daily regimen at work with my other friends that like the\nfilm.  I think Tarantino is so smart for casting Rhames in this role and what it makes it that much better is knowing\nthat Rhames is one of the most humble men in Hollywood, remember when he gave back his Emmy to Jack Lemmon as he\ntearfully said that he hadnt paid enough dues yet and Lemmon was one of his idols?  The man can do no wrong in my eyes.\nHe is one of a kind.As for the rest of Pulp Fiction, this is a film that will often be imitated but never duplicated.\nThat is an old cliche but it is so true in this case. It is completely original and without a doubt, what makes it so\noriginal and so great is simply the writing.  What other film can have gangsters talking about foot massages and the\nimportance of them just before they are about to perform a hit.  What other film can describe in great detail what a\npilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all\nbefore entering into a room to ramble on about the Bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with\nextreme prejudice.  There is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film.  Pulp fiction takes violence and\nsurrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some\nstrange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared\ncar with domesticated products that are located under Jimmys sink, oral pleasure, speaking Bora Bora, getting day jobs\nas opposed to robbing banks, being cool like Fonzie and five dollar milkshakes.  How and where Tarantino thought of this\nscript is beyond me, all I know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that I have seen Pulp Fiction.  I\ncan understand why this film was passed over at the Oscars for Forrest Gump, but in most peoples opinion this was the\nbest film of 1994.  I loved Gump and Shawshank Redemption but I also loved Pulp Fiction and if it would have won Best\nPicture that year I would have been just as happy.  Pulp Fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be\nremembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200\nyears ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) Pulp Fiction is going to be one of them mentioned.  When you can have\nChristopher Walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have\nAmanda Plummer and Tim Roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have Travolta and Jackson talk about walking the\nEarth like Kane in Kung Fu, have Eric Stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a\nshot to an O.D-ing Uma Thurman, have Harvey Keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 8:00 AM and then appear on the scene to\n\"solve problems\" have Tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy\nstuff his wife buys, have Bruce Willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have Ving Rhames talk\nabout having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and \"pop a cap\" in someones ass if he shows up in Indo-China and have it\nall make sense, well you have something special.  Pulp Fiction isnt a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true\nfilm fans.  This may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life\nand they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some\nHollywood films.  This is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen\nand paper.  It redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and\na half hours. I did, immensely, and I think most people will, and have.  If you really have not seen this, then you are\nrobbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film.  This is easily one of the best films\never made.  How anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and I cant see how you can truly call yourself a film\nfan if you cant see the brilliance of this film.",

I will admit that there is a lot\nto see in Avary and Tarantinos script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jacksons\ncharacter. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest\nof the movie I wasnt so happy with. Pulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas\nwhich also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesnt look that original. But I will admit that the story in\nPulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very\npowerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma\nThurmans part which I felt was filling time. I didnt think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great\nhumor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he\nis going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesnt have\nthe \"N\" word and also where the climax of each scene isnt filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I\nwonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.  Pulp\nFiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on\nthe violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone.",

    "reviewBody": "Although it had some competition \"Pulp Fiction\" is my choice for best film of the 90s! \"Forrest Gump\", \"GoodFellas\",\nand \"Fargo\", all came close, but none measure up to this Tarantino classic. Everything in this movie is as good as it\ngets. The screenplay is amazing, winning \"Pulp\" its ONLY acadamy award of 1994. Most all of the awards it should have\nwon were stolen away by one of my earlier mentioned, honorable mentions for best 90s film \"Forrest Gump\" which truly is\na classic, but isnt on the level of \"Pulp\". Overall, the script is marvoulsly written and put together by Tarantino and\nAvary.The acting spawned numerous acadamy award nominations, but suprisingly didnt win any. Samuel L. Jackson definetly\ngives a worthy performance as the bible quoting, \"N\" word saying hit man Jules that changes his thoughts about his\ncareer after what he calls a divine intervention. John Travalto proves he truly is the comeback kid  also earning a\nnomination for his Elvis-Man,Vicent, type hitman who gets blown away in the bathroom, but still appears in the end of\nthe film, because of how the script is written. (For some reason Tarantino makes all of his characters in all of his\nmovies wind up in the bathroom to create interesting situations. Roth and Bushemi in \"Dogs\". Jackson, Thurman, and\nTravolta in \"Pulp\", and, well, I dont remember one in \"Jackie Brown\". Oh Well, No Matter.) Bruce Willis is particularly\nfun and powerful as Butch in the seen where he stumbles into the wrong store at the wrong time. Along side him is Ving\nRhames in an equally powerful performance as Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman plays Mia, Mea, however you spell it, the\nwife of Marcellas, who, when unable to handle a hit,is ran around all over every where, leading up to a highly intense\nadrenaline shot seen. Christopher Walken makes a funny cameo, Harvey Kietel does, too. Even Tarantino himself makes a\ncameo as Jimmy. All in all, all the suprising twists and turns, and breathtaking action/violence make \"Pulp Fiction an\ninstant classic!",

They are VINCENT VEGA (Travolta) JULES (Jackson) and a host of others,\nnamely BRUCE WILLIS, UMA THURMAN, and HARVEY KEITEL. The film is told in a very non-linear format, with the end in the\nmiddle and the start at the end etc. But the stories are incredibly well-written and woven.

Great actors\nand actresses put in career performances with a little help from Tarantino. Willis and Jackson are the main men, but\nVing Rhames is excellent. Christopher Walken and Steve Buscemi make excellent cameos along with Tarantino. Thurman was\ngood yet under-used. Travolta was fairly cool. To be fair, there was not much wrong with the films actors at all. A\ngood choice of cast: WELL DONE!Warning: The film, whilst not glorifying violence or drug abuse, has some strong drug and\nviolence scenes. Despite this, it is a funny and entertaining film, but if u r easily offended by the previous elements,\nhave caution. BUT DONT LET IT RUIN THIS EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME!

I like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time. Too bad it can never be\nas fresh as the first time, but the exhiliration and thrill is still there.Its so cool how Tarantino can put everything\nhe loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew. Not to mention surf guitar\nand cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and\nridiculousness of it all.I also like how Quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so\nviewings. You might not have noticed (or even have cared for that matter), but in almost every scene theres a little\nthing going, sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip, ultraviolent cult fave. I like how the\nscene involving Christopher Walken and the young Butch. Walken almost changes every word in explaining Butchs fathers\ndeath for the sake of Butch and his mother. Also at the end, if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt, they\nlook like real bystanders in a hold-up.I also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine\nthem outside the movie. Like Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz. I always imagine them getting high and cheating on each\nother. Not to mention Tarantino putting questions out there for us.

Not to speak of Walken in a small role handing\nWillis the watch that, according to his monologue, sat years in someones there-where-the-sun-dont-shine before being\nhanded on, without being completely unbelievable ?

Each story and set piece so silkily woven around an underbelly that is usually used to coarser a\ncloth.No member of the cast is found wanting. No part of the storyline a disappointment. If violent movies have to be\nmade, then this is the way to make them. The cartoonish manner of both characterization and action makes it far more\ndigestible than films such as Goodfellas.A special mention for Samuel L Jackson. He is the axle on which the whole thing\nturns. I think he was highly underestimated and was generally crowded out in the plaudits by supporters of cinemas\nprodigal son,- John Travolta.Score 9/10",

No other director than Quentin Tarantino could have made this movie so special. Just take a look\nat.., lets say Reservoir Dogs. Here he use the same teqnique, but in a totally different way. He is very aware of his\none directing, Tarantino, and he seems like a very intelligent person. Therefore I say that Pulp Fiction is a movie,\nthat indeed deserves 10 stars.",

Ive always been a massive\nfan of Tobey  Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to\nreview this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods\nand callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well  Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend!

    "reviewBody": "I cant, I cant. The whole studio was screaming from the beginning until end of the movie, this movie was so perfect,\nEpic, Awesome and I cant even describe it. When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until\nnow the visual, edit, it so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause they visual look great\nlike a game. I still cant believe its look like what fans theory said and fan made I cant.I really enjoyed the movie\nthe credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked,\nshacking, thats was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me to HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I\nwas really wanna cry cause it was so good. I cant stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I\nreally wanna watch it again. And venom part I thought he was going to help or fight the spiderman, but he was give a\nvenom to MCU. This movie was one of the saddest MCU movies ever Im so sad when aunt may died, and everyone forget about\nPeter Parker. At the end Peter Parker was make a new suit and the suit its really looked like the other spiderman\nmovie. This was so on fire!!!!!.Ive watch this 3 times and theres some scene not make sense but this movie still so so\nso good... like when The girl From MIT open her seatbelt and then when Car want to fall she was use the seatbelt. And\nSpiderman costum when Dr otto Break his costume The Middle of The costume was break, and when green goblin come The suit\nwas not full, idk why but maybe cause when he fully his costum to save him From Dr otto maybe cause he didnt use The\nMask so The custom was full in his body and when he use The Mask his Middle custome was break.Edit : Ive been thinking\nabout this like a month I think no way home VFX its not that good I mean it was really look like a fan made edits.",

    "reviewTitle": "Everything I wanted and more",
    "reviewBody": "Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First\nof all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it\nand thats honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from\nthemselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didnt feel in the other\nmovies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter\nand May. Lizard wasnt in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from\nElectro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his\nnew look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didnt\nmake him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters \"Uncle Ben\" was amazing, she\ndelivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies\nthan we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow its good to see\nhim again looking great and I cant wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course...\nAndrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went\nmad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a\nlot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe\nthey will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I\nwanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points\nIll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was\njust so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the\nSpider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic\naccurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I cant wait to see what they will\ndo. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could\nbe some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves\nand the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and Im glad I was there to see it, its a good laugh,\nits a good thrill and its Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!",

    "reviewBody": "Points:1. Tom Holland, Zendaya, Andrew Garfield and the rest give 10/10 performances.2. Brilliant action with\noutstanding CGI given they had a year maybe less.3. Mays death is a beautiful scene left for as long as it should have\nand Tom Holland is brilliant.4. Every character from the multiverse felt like themselves and Andrews performance\nsolidified his Peter as the most comic accurate.5. Even though it is a multiverse movie (which can get confusing) you\nstill understand everything and it all makes sense.6. This is Tom Hollands film even with the two Spider-Men, they\nstill make sure he is the main focus.7. The grief Peter goes through is perfectly pictured and Andrews Peter described\nthat he had that feeling after Gwens death.Overall the best Spider-Man film and best MCU film to date.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spectacular and amazing but not a complete homerun",
    "reviewBody": "Updated with spoilers:\nThis is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is\ngreat, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For\nthe first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line -\nand I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed\nit which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer\ngraphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was\nbadly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with\nStrange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective\nuniverse. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the\npeople that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Bens? That would make more sense.\nMy final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice,\nbut it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is\namazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any\nsuperhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors\ndo an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some\nsaw a long \"trailer\", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh,\nkinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so\nkinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen\nportrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than\nBatwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye\nshow (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the\nMCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies\ndo. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly\nrecommend.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Biggest, Grandest And Most Exhilarating Spidey Flick Ever Appeared On Big Screen!",
    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -\nMovie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyones heart. Tobey\nMaguires Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing\nSpider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014)\nand MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which\nmade Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for\nthe Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you\nlove Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the\nyears, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes\nit in style. But, he is not alone. This is Hollands first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still\nhe is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas\nPresent in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final\nproduct. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to\nforget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of\ntime dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parkers\nuniverse. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret\nby me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna\nand Erik Sommers writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments\nwhatsoever. Just one condition, you dont have to look for the logic because youre watching a Marvel/Sonys Superhero\nfilm, not Christopher Nolans Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The\nSpider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that\nintelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops\nthe list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCUs Spider-Man No Way\nHome. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action,\nfantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but\nnot the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of\nmany Spidey fans but thats where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial\npotboiler, thats what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode\nat the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCUs most exhilarating entertainer\npost Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no\nmatter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*",

    "reviewBody": "NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first\nemotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I\nstill dont get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always\ngrowing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service -\nalready mentioned - is simply too much. Its not only what you are thinking. Its remembering all the single moments you\ncan imagine, its in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you \"hey, Im here, remember?\".\nBut what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy.\nThis also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the\ntable.Its not a perfect film. Its still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The\nhumour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.",

The fight\nscenes are absolute remarkable and so is the emotions that it gave. Of course, Ill just say it, Tobey and Andrew being\nin this movie really made it something, the nostalgic references they made (for example Tobey speaking about his back\nand them talking about how he has organic webs.)But its not just that Tobey and Andrew being in it that made it great.\nWe finally get to see a big leap in Tom Holland and even though the green goblin technically isnt his enemy from the\nstart it became personal when Tom had to witness Aunt May die (truly saddening scene. I also love how they finally used\nUncle Bens quote, \"with great power comes great responsibility.\")Im going to finish this review off by talking about\nthe ending and the future of MCU Spider-Man. The last fight was absolutely remarkable, a hand-to-hand combat with heavy\nand emotional punches, and you could see how feelings got to Tom when he nearly stabbed Osborn, but Tobey stopped him.\nIt was a perfect moment, no words, just them looking at each other because they had a connection in how it is to be\novertaken, they understood each other, and it was honestly beautiful.So the future of Spider-Man is looking extremely\npromising, thanks to Toms incredible sacrifice of making everyone forget that Peter exists and that there is only\nSpider-Man was an excellent step for Toms Spider-Man. Im happy to see that he has grown from the Iron Boy Jr. To\nSpider-Man.Him living by himself now off to college with what seems to be a new darker tone (and an amazing new suit,\nfinally a better symbol) really excites me for the next trilogy coming.",

The action was nothing extra, on multiple\noccasions I had a hard time of keeping up with what was actually going on beside \"they fight\".The soundtrack in the mcu\nmovies have always been kind of unnoticeable. Here they had a lot of opportunities to bring in the old tunes but I felt\nthat the music never really kicked inThe bluetooth controlled arms?Doc Ock coming to terms with his mistakes in\nSpider-Man 2 and overpowering the evil AI with pure will power was the coolest thing.Here the AI in Peters suit hacked\nDoc Ocks robotic arms, put them both down and then restrained the arms.This is the real AI to worry about.Overall the\nmovie was entertaining but a lot of things felt rushed. Bringing back the old guys was a great move I will give them\nthat, this is also what raises the score for me.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spider-Man: No Way Home, my first review",
    "reviewBody": "How long has Spider-Man: No Way Home been buzzing around social media for? Take a moment to appreciate how much of an\nimpact the build-up for this epic finale to Tom Hollands Spider-Man trilogy had on not only the die hard MCU fans, but\nalso the audience who were brought out of the woodworks to reinstate just how much of an impact the classic Spider-Man\ncomics had on their lives. There was certainly no new news to what we expected from this film, in that almost every fan\ntheory was precisely calculated, as well as knowing how we were going to expect a thrill ride of an adventure, and No\nWay Home is definitely no stranger to forcing you to eye the screen with your full concentration for the entirety of the\nruntime.A film directed by Jon Watts, Spider-Man: No Way Home focuses on the ramifications of the leaked identity of\nPeter Parker (Tom Holland) after successfully defeating Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), directly following on from the\nevents of Spider-Man: Far From Home. The movie opens up with the immediate reactions of the general public and\nconsequences slowly begin to follow up, such as Peter, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon) failing to be accepted\nadmission into M. I. T, directly delving deeper into the controversy surrounding the perceived identity of Peter Parker,\nadvertised none other than J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons). Peter is now a criminal.After experiencing his persona\nbeing tarnished, Peter approaches Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and requests that a spell be cast on the entire\nworld to ensure that everyone forgets who Peter Parker is, which expectedly with all of Peters requests to tamper with\nthe spell backfires. Quickly moving on from Peters problems and slowly into what the audience was wanting from the\nfilm, we see familiar faces such as Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), previously from the Sam\nRaimi Spider-Man films. It is now in Peters favor to undo the entrances of all these characters coming from alternate\nuniverses with the help of his friends MJ and Ned.The links with the previous Spider-Man films was certainly the most\ncompelling and intricate idea to bring together a multitude of characters, a personal highlight for me was to see Willem\nDafoe reprise the iconic role of Norman Osbourne, and reliving the insanity and his incredible skill as an actor, as\nwell as dropping the iconic line of \"you know, Im something of a scientist myself\" to draw laughs from the audience\ntaking inspiration from the iconic internet meme it became. Its with utmost confidence that the majority of the MCUs\nsuperhero movies are fairly predictable in how they execute their stories to the audience, however No Way Home trusts\nthat although a lot of the film has been predetermined, it uses the iconic phrase of \"with great power comes great\nresponsibility\" and the connection with the previous franchises adds significant depth to the film.The massive beat to\nthis film are the returns of both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker from other dimensions. What\nimpressed me about how they were brought into this film was that it wasnt an immediate wow moment. This is because\nthe audience wasnt already on the edge of a seat during an intense action sequence when they were revealed. Instead,\nWatts decided to bring them into the movie slowly with some humor attached to it.The climax of the film is fairly fluid\nand slick in terms of action and while it was not the final battle we expected in terms of excitement, there was still\nan emotional aspect to be considered after witnessing the death of Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) so the film didnt have any\nplace to get us out of our seats too quickly, but just to enjoy the ride while it lasted. It doesnt succumb to anything\ntoo over the top such as the final battle in Avengers: Endgame.Expanding a bit on the influence of marketing a film to\nyour audience before its release, the question to be asked was how surprised were you when you finally saw Tobey\nMaguire and Andrew Garfield finally appear on screen? These so-called fan theories of other Spider-Mans appearing in a\nscene as well as leaked photos of all three Spider-Mans in a picture together added too much credibility to this being\nthe big reveal in the film. Its certainly a difficult process to be able to hide all these secrets however one\nimportant thing to note when it comes to viewing anything for the first time is that social media hype can actually\nhave a much more everlasting and detrimental effect on your overall perceptions and thoughts about a film once you have\nseen it for yourself and with all of this in mind. And Spider-Man: No Way Home was definitely one of those films that\nfell right into that trap.At the end of the film, my overall feelings were that from what I had witnessed during the\nevents leading towards this film I would have expected a much more satisfying feeling leaving that cinema, because all\nthe press and promotion that took place before the final release of the film along with all the fan-theories had created\nso many holes to fill. Now, thats nothing to say this is a negative review of some sort as this film went above and\nbeyond to articulate some of the most revolutionary feats anyone has seen in an MCU film or any film in general.\nHowever, one thing for certain is that the build-up of a film is a massive factor and plays a huge part in how we see\nSpider-Man: No Way Home as a film overall.. Thats the main problem with a film that becomes far too popular amidst\nfans, that as it is so highly anticipated within the industry it becomes too much of an expectation theory, in that what\nyou expect to see on the screen tends to be far over the limit to what you actually get.Spider-Man: No Way Home could be\nargued as cinematic history bringing together generations of characters lasting since 2002, and the cast and crew did\nan amazing job to reunite such a humongous community of fans to enjoy probably one of the most impressive feats the MCU\nhave ever pulled off. My only wish was that there wasnt as much social media buzz about this film, as I reckon it could\nhave been a better experience overall had all these fan theories and leaks gone out the window. But this film, it had a\nunique concept, and thats what counts.",

    "reviewBody": "Booked the day off to see this today as did NOT want to be spoiled ha, and it was totally worth it.If anyone is curious,\nand hasnt seen it yet - yep Toby and Andrew are back. Their revelation was actually really cute, and not what Id\nexpected before going in (still wasnt convinced they were 100% in it - but I did think it might happen when Holland\nfails to catch MJ, one of the others sweeps in and gets her. Spoiler - theyre in way before that). One really nice\nsurprise was the amount of Toby/Andrew we had. Its made me miss them. Their banter was cute af and it was nice to see\nemotion from their own films being brought into this movie.One criticism I have, or an unfulfilled wish I suppose - is\nthat I wish wed have had more insight into their current lives, beyond what wed seen. We get a hint from Toby that him\nand MJ are still together but I wanted more ha.I think as I was watching it I realised its literally only the audience\nthat this is exciting for; the characters have absolutely no reference to each other so theres a lack of surprise if\nyou like - between each of the SpiderMan/any other character. This couldve potentially been resolved by having\nsupporting characters like MJ for Toby or maybe Aunt May for Andrew. Maybe not them, but some way for the characters to\ninteract in a way that wasnt as complete strangers. The villains dont give much of that.Another thing that wasnt my\nfav, was the villain story. It wasnt terrible AT ALL, but I just didnt get why Tom was so adamant to save them from\ndying; when he knew they were villains. I know he doesnt want to kill, but it seemed weak to assume hed be that\ninvested when he obviously just needed to get them back home. And it also was a bit confusing after all the excitement\nof TAs return, what the 3 SpiderMen had agreed to do. I sort of had to guess as it was happening.The ending was\nbrilliant, in my opinion. There was real emotion with Zendaya and Tom - and it opens up the next movies with some real\nquestions. It could even close the Tom era, if that was the way they decided to go/Holland didnt want to return.I dont\nthink anyone will be let down by this movie, even though our expectations have been built up to be absolutely enormous.\nIt delivers. Maybe not as you expect but thats probably good as well as less so.Enjoy!",

    "reviewBody": "I dont like the NWHs plot. Messy and forced. In order for the multiverse concept to happen, it seems like it endures\nwith some cheap writings. The bigger MCU becomes, a lot of things have to compromise with the big picture. It creates a\nlot of ripples that dont match the flow. Hence it becomes forced and harder to keep the consistency than how it should\nbe.Fight scenes are moderate, nothing spectacular except Dr Strange ones. A lot of cringe dialogues, scenes, and\ncharacters inconsistency. Again, too forced.Maybe a lot of fans will still root for NWH as it is a fine fan service\nafter all. But as a movie itself, it is not good enough. Anything notable is William Dafoes performance.It is nothing\nlike what a fan boasts, that it levels with Endgame. No, not even close.",

The idea of Andrew and Tobey even\nreturning was such an amazing thing to imagine, but seeing it on the big screen was truly incredible. The chemistry\nbetween Tom, Andrew and Tobey is on point and really feels \"real\" in a sense. For me personally, Andrew really steals\nthe show which really feels like they gave him a redemption after being let down by the writers in his own movies.\nHaving old villains return for one final showdown is just golden. Willem DaFoe puts on an incredible performance\nalongside Alfred Molina. Personally Jamie Foxx was my favourite out of the bunch, he really stood out among his fellow\ncast. Cant wait for Toms next trilogy and what it might hold. If you had suggested this concept a few years back\npeople wouldve thought you were crazy.

    "reviewBody": "Alright, I will join the familiar \"I dont usually write reviews on IMDb but I am gonna make an exception for this one\"\nclub. I sincerely wanted to love this movie, just as any other movie Ive watched and I will ever watch. Why? Because\nleaving the theater disappointed is one of the most unpleasant feelings a film lover could ever experience. Its like\nbeing deprived of something you felt was rightfully yours. Anyway...Back to the movie: does it contain everything\neveryone was expecting from it? Yes. The second half is basically a giant meme composed of all the \"imagine if they did\nthis scene where the three spideys talk about X\" type of comments I have read over and over under the \"No Way Home\"\ntrailers. Is this a problem for me? No, not per se. But it becomes one if this sort of exaggerated fan-service distracts\nthe viewers from the main issue regarding this movie, that is: it is extremely childish. To the point where it becomes\nunrealistic and, therefore, poorly written. Leaving aside the cringey jokes (that make up a consistent part of the\nmovie, by the way), the entire first half is driven by nonsensical choices made by all the characters, both young and\nadult ones. And to all you out there arguing that the movie mostly deals with adolescents, keep in mind that theres a\nhuge difference between high school and kindergarten. I wont go into the details of all the problems I have with this\nmovies screenplay: if youve seen the movie and youre not delusional youll know what Im talking about.With Peter and\nGreen Goblins first fight, the movie takes a completely different turn, instantly becoming darker and more serious, and\nalso way more enjoyable. Dont get me wrong, dialogues are still overall amateurish and predictable, but there are way\nmore fight scenes, meaning that the characters dont talk that much. And thats a blessing, because the silent moments\nare the ones that prevent me from giving this movie an even lower rating: Aunt Mays passing is painfully touching and\nPeter and MJs encounter after Doctor stranges spell is magical in its drama.To sum things up, this movie really left\nme thinking about some of the latest Marvel movies inherent problems:1) Are all Marvel movies destined to have the same\ntone, regardless of the plot?2) Is the quality of the Marvel movies only determined by the degree to which they satisfy\nthe viewers expectations, regardless of more technical issues, like screenplay, cinematography and such?To quote this\n(and the first Spider-Man movie): \"with great power comes great responsibility\". Well, the greatest power of all is\nintelligence and it should never be forgotten when it comes to writing movies.",

    "reviewBody": "Spider has always been a movie that never quite kept everyone happy as everybody has a certain expectation of their most\nbeloved characters.This movie solves all this by throwing everything spiderman related and created at you in just over 2\nhours.The movies bounces up and down in the he first half and starts to take form in the second half. Tom Holland\ndelivers strongly on the emotionally side of things. Itge villains have all been refined and are a lot slicker. Hats off\nto Willem Dafoe for pulling it out of the bag a second time. Tobey Maguire was always one the weakest of the 3\nSpidermen. It shows here. His acting chops dont match Andrew or Tom. For nostalgia reasons and the purposes of the\nstory he fit in well. I always found Andrew Garfield the best of the 3 with the worse movies. Garfield really shines\nin.this movie and I think he steals every scene. Its a shame the movies he was in were not of a higher calibre..\nIn conclusion this movie is a fun ride that pays a massive service to fans of the movies and comics alike. While it is\nstill light viewing for the most part it is a roller coaster of emotions. Some of the darkest Spiderman scenes filmed\ntake place in this movie.. The plot is a bit messy and clunky. Dr Strange kind of feels out of place in the movie.\nUnderstandably the situations could not have taken place without him. Some of the fight scene are not great but this is\nnot where the heart of this movie is. Its a story of Spiderman finally understanding the motto he wears on his sleeve.\nWith Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. This movie achieves that.",

    "reviewTitle": "Ambitious, Exhilarating - Lives up to the Hype!",
    "reviewBody": "Having the previous Spider-Man characters in the film was a guaranteed recipe for success. Andrew Garfield and Toby\nMaguire entered the fray perfectly. Garfield stole the show in my opinion, but seeing the chemistry between him and Toby\nand then both of them with Holland was a childhood dream come true. Despite rumours floating around beforehand of their\nappearances in the movie, it was still an incredibly surprising moment when they actually appeared on screen. Audible\ngasps were heard in the cinema and despite knowing with some surety that it would happen, it was still a pleasant\nsurprise.The amount of screen time Maguire and Garfield got felt just right. They were present enough to make an impact\nand provide us with the smiles, laughter and nostalgic familiarity that we wanted so much, but not so much as to\novershadow Holland and to make us forget the fact that this in fact is a film where he is the main character.It was\nbrilliant how the film was able to poke fun at itself by way of the three different Peter Parkers. They joked about how\nMaguire was the only one who didnt need a contraption to shoot webs and this semi-breaking of the fourth wall made the\naudience feel respected in that everyone was aware of the contradictions in the different visions of Spider-Man\nthroughout the decades and how these differences were all together in the same room, united. Maguire, Garfield and\nHolland worked excellently together, and despite Maguire looking visibly older he was able to bring a presence of\nexperience alongside his traditional goofiness to the table. Any scene with more than one Spider-Man was a pleasure to\nwatch.Another aspect of the film that I was happy about was the notable step away from relying on the MCU. While the\nconnection to the MCU can be a huge benefit to a superhero film, it can also act as somewhat of a crutch for weaker\ncharacters who cant stand on their own. In No Way Home, while the link to the wider MCU is both established and used via\nthe help of Dr Strange (in fact he is an integral part), he feels like only a section of the movie and not part of its\nmain storyline. At each step he is kept realistically occupied so that the problems throughout the film can be addressed\nwithout him and the wider MCU. This finally addressed what I found problematic in the earlier Tom Holland films and\nallowed the Spider-Man franchise to stand on its own eight feet for once.Although Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield were\nmore or less supporting characters in this film, its clear that the script writers gave them enough respect and us\nenough fan-service to ensure that their characters developed beyond their original stories all these years later. For\nGarfields Spider-Man this comes at a heart-stopping moment when during the final battle MJ falls off the scaffolding\ntowards an untimely end. Tom Hollands Spider-Man makes a dash for her in an eerie echo to how Garfields Spider-Man\ndove right after Gwen Stacey in his film. Sadly for Garfields Spider-Man however, he was too late and he was unable to\nsave Gwen as she hit the ground and died and it seems for a moment that this fate will again play out as Hollands\nSpider-Man is obstructed from saving MJ by the Green Goblins glider. It is at this very moment that Garfields\nSpider-Man swoops in with fire in his eyes to save MJ and do what he never did in his own universe. Prevent Spider-Mans\nlove interest from death. We see his emotion flare up and with tears in his eyes we see him realise what he has\naccomplished. No doubt this provides his character with some much needed healing, and us with some much needed\nclosure.For Maguire it came in the form of matured, heartfelt mentoring. Despite the closeness between Tony Stark and\nPeter Parker in this universe, the only one who could really understand how Hollands Peter Parker felt after the tragic\ndeath of his Aunt May was another Spider-Man who had also felt loss. Although Garfields Spider-Man had felt this loss\ntoo, Maguire was able to provide a matured, healed and calming presence to Hollands Peter Parker to help him navigate\nhis grief. Boy did he need it. Hollands Spider-Man was on a rampage during the final fight with the Green Goblin and\nfor the first time we saw a brutal side of him that enjoyed causing pain to his enemies. It was unexpected but a\nreminder that without the guidance of those older and wiser than us, we are susceptible to fall into mistakes that can\nruin us. Maguire was able to guide Holland away from such a path and towards one of compassion and mercy, emphasised by\nthe theme of \"cure, not kill\", which meant that villains would be pacified and returned to their original,\npre-supervillain state instead of killed. This guidance was profound and enabled Hollands Peter Parker to overcome his\nanger and transcend it, allowing him to become the hero his suit deserved. Maguire really shined here and we understood\nthe effect that time, loss and sacrifice can have on a man.Ultimately, Tom Hollands Spider-Man was mentored at the time\nhe needed it most, by the very people (essentially matured versions of himself) who were best suited to do so. He was\nable to realise that there were other who knew how he felt and who could show him a better path.I found it interesting\nto note that a criticism of Tom Hollands Peter Parker initially was that we didnt get to see him \"become\" Spider-Man.\nFrom the first time we saw him, he already was the friendly neighbourhood hero we are familiar with. We didnt even see\nhim experience loss with the traditional death of his Uncle Ben sparking a quest of grief and self-discovery leading to\nhis maturity into the Spider-Man we know. In No Way Home however, we see this moment of loss occur when we least\nexpect it. Hollands Peter Parker loses his Aunt May after the apartment they are in is attacked by the Green Goblin.\nBefore she passes she is able to convey the famous words of wisdom which are destined to ring in the ears of every\nwebbed superhero until the end of time, \"With great power comes great responsibility\". Seeing Hollands Peter Parker\nexperience this loss in the 3rd film instead of the first was a twist I didnt see coming, but it showed that the script\nwriters didnt forget about the original formula. While they didnt follow it to a tee, they still incorporated it into\ntheir vision. I can respect that. It also felt as though even though it happened in his third film, it may be a hint\ntowards a new beginning for his character, one where he is self confident and sure in his identity and intentions.In\norder to save the world he knows from collapsing in on itself, Hollands Peter Parker has to make an agonising choice.\nThe only way to fix things properly is to erase everyones memory about him, to the extent that no one would know that\nhe is Spider-Man anymore. His best friend and love interest, MJ would be living their lives as if they never knew who he\nwas. Seeing that this is the only way forward, Hollands Spider-Man take the leap of faith and asks Dr Strange to make\nit happen. Its heart-breaking results are seen towards the end of the film when Holland goes to meet an MJ with no\nmemories of Peter Parker as Spider-Man and tell her everything so they can get back together again. Noticing some minor\ninjuries MJ sustained during the final battle previously, Parker pauses for introspection before deciding not to open up\nto her. By making such a painful decision, MJ is saved from entering a world where she is inherently at danger due to\nassociating with Spider-Man at all. In previous films, Maguire and Garfields Spider-Man have been able to make this\ndecision consensually with their respective love interests, but this time it is only Peter Parker who knows. As he sees\nMJ and his former best friend Ned enjoy their time together as friends, he realises that he does better service to them\nby keeping them safe even if it means he loses their love and companionship. This is the ultimate sacrifice he makes for\nthem, choosing to bear this pain alone as he allows them to live blissfully unaware of their previous life.Hollands\nPeter Parker was able to embody perfectly the meaning of the words echoing in his mind and the mind of all Spider-Men in\nall universes, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".This movie started off as the previous films did. It had a\ntint of childishness to it which meant I couldnt really take it seriously compared to previous entries in the\nfranchise. But I realise now that No Way Home served as a coming of age moment for Hollands Peter Parker. He has been\nable to shed his previous life and relationships through grief, loss and sacrifice while learning and being mentored by\nsome of the greatest mentors any Peter Parker could have. I truly feel like his Spider-Man has matured through to the\npoint that he is ready to stand on his own and give us the Peter Parker we have always expected. He delivered in this\nfilm and we saw him grow and mature to where his identity is set in stone. Although people may have historically taken\nissue with Hollands Spider-Man in that there was no origin story like the previous Spider-Man heroes had, in hindsight\nit feels like the entire trilogy of Holland films have led up to this moment and I am able to fully appreciate that\nnow.The events of the film also signal a break away from the main MCU characters, as everyone would have lost their\nmemory of Peter Parker and potentially have no idea how to contact a web-slinging superhero in New York. I dont expect\nhis inclusion in wider, high profile MCU films for a while, and considering the direction this film has taken, I am OK\nwith that. Tied in to the fact that his Aunt May has died and Parker has now finished High School and now going to\nCollege, separating from his old friends and life seems like a logical step forward.I look forward to his further\nadventures.",

Let me tell ya something, theyre in the movie and they have a 25-30 minute screen time, the interaction and\nchemistry between the three Spider-Men are absolutely incredible and funny, the movie honour Tobey and Andrew legacy and\ntheir appearance makes Tom Holland Spider-Man matured, all of three have the same proportion of spotlight so all\nSpider-Men are treated equally, the CGI being more advanced now showcase Tobeys skill as Spider-Man better.",

Personally i still think andrew garfield is the best spider man, and the fact that he made\nan appearance was awesome i really loved that they also bring back all the old villains and of course the og tobey\nmaguire, i dont see how they can make another spider man movie after this one because this acts as a good way to end\nthe spider man movie collection. The ending deeply saddened me as well as the death of aunt may (RIP )The only thing i\ndisliked about the movie is some characters made bad unrealistic decisions which made them look stupid but i guess these\ndecisions must be made in order to have the action so it cancels out. The post credit scenes were interesting but im a\nbit annoyed that one of them was basically a trailer for a future movie which ruined the experience but the first scene\nwas a bit odd at first, but when i understood that the symbiote was in tom hollands universe i was shocked as this could\nbe the start of another movie. It is amazing how we get to see these actors grow up, it will be interesting to see if\nspider-man is still going on in 10yrs and how will the actors look like compared to their current state.",

Very Emotiona like in the old spider man movies and it looks like the\nstory goes back to the beginning of spider man 2002. To be honest, I dont like Spider man in the Avangers Team. Spider\nman deserves an own movie without too much science fiction and too much magic of avangers. This one was an exception and\na masterpiece as well.

Starts off\nfun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to\nall things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but\nwith a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and\nare also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why hes such a good Doctor Strange with his\nexcellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the\nstandout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts direction is superb, the action sequences are\nthrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. Theres a few homages to the styles of the\nprevious iterations and some gorgeous imagery.Its also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime\nfeeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a\nfew weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and\nuse of Hollands iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are\nbeautifully epic.",

    "reviewTitle": "An Epic Film That Really Delivers",
    "reviewBody": "Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I\nhave watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Mans secret identity revealed, he\ntries to get Doctor Stranges help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause\nproblems for both of them.Main Character\nTom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see\nhow he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world.\nHe doesnt have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I\nthought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters\nZendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything\nthat goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels\nnatural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really\ngood, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some\nreally interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character.\nJacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character\nthat supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is\nback as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce\noff and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie\nFoxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in\ntheir roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2\nand I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story\nThe story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of\na character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for\nme was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their\ncharacters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script\nMCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is\nreally handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didnt outweigh the serious and darker parts\nof the film.Style\nThe film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from\nthe other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good,\ndespite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isnt really any filler here\nwhich is an impressive feat.Overall\nOverall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I\nhave just watched the film but I cant find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will\nfind this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.",

    "reviewBody": "I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as\npowerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well\ndeveloped evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Hollands era due to a lackluster couple of\nprevious solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU  Superhero\nmovies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCUs Peter Parker\nfinally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely\npopulated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parkers Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being\nfaithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are\nreally strong, the script covers its plotholes  weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending\nlooks like a true ending to Hollands Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise. I did not\nbuy any trailer nor stinger from this movie and I was blown away. Best Spider-Man movie tied with Spider-Verse and Sam\nRaimis 2004 sequel. See it now!",

But Spider-man\nhas had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth,\nthis exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way\nHome managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a\nstory-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting\nnever seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which\nI think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home\nis a great movie I highly recommend.

    "reviewBody": "I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really dont wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie\nwill live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you wont witness anything\nnew. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But dont get me wrong they were\nawesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. Its also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You\nalso have a very very silly plot that was based on some characters opinion and lead to all the events of the film and\nthen comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here\ncomes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every\naction sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of\nSpidy suits and most importantly you wont be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange\nand believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great\nactor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidys GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and\nfeels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked!\nEven the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a\nperfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and thats\nwhat make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this\none is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan Id give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love\nand joy is fair enough.",

Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film.\nStranges role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated\nSeries again...I dont even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the\nedge of your seat.The action scenes are the best Ive ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in\ncomicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and\nagain.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In\nsome places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There\nare comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much\ndarker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and thats tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some\nsmaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding!\n(Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchinos music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some\ndarker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more\ntangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads\nstraight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!",

    "reviewBody": "NO SPOILERS!Everything that has been previously built has led up to this and tens to hundreds of theories have been\nspeculated and lo and behold, this is so much better than Endgame. Though most of the theories arent true, but its\nimpressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home\nopens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films,\nanything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated\nfilm of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. Its exciting, refreshing and\nbreaking new grounds insofar that its unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and\nnew generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, whats so great\nabout No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand\neven coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the\ntable. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who\ndespises him, youll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical\nstorytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at\nthat is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone\nhas a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in\nan appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this\nfilm. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience\nand intelligence. Only when you see the film, youll understand what Im saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but\nhaunting ending before. I dont wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like its coming\nfrom an Oscar-worthy film and Im not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its\ncheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little\nbit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are\ngood and exciting but I feel like it doesnt live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing\nshocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions,\nsimilar to Infinity War  Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.",

    "reviewBody": "Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in\nHigh School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in \"Spider-Man: No Way\nHome\".Taking place where \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by\nTabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow\nhis every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the\nattention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his\nidentity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict\nCumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange\nagrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ\n(Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications\narise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does\nnot know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before\nthem.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and\ngive them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they\nhad.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from\nbad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the\nfact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice\nit to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and\ndeliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for\nthe characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan\nservice in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and\nopens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a\ntrailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven\nstories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.",

Of\ncourse No Way Home has many surprises that I wont spoil, but dont expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty\nsimple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot. So dont be spoiled if you wanted to have fun\nwatching Spider-Man No Way Home, because the surprise elements are the key of this film.",

The action is nice but not as good as stuff like shang-chi.These are just small nit-picks, the\noverall experience is still great.*There are Two End-credit scenes, and Both are fantastic.**Willem Dafoe more like\nWillem DaGoat.",

    "reviewBody": "One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with\njokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Mans character, but also for\nthe fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to\nwitness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on\nconsequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays\ninteresting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the\nfilm a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home\nwill please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached\nwhen certain characters popped up again and I definitely didnt feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The\nperformances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the\nfans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some\nminor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more\nscreentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my\nfavourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.",

    "reviewBody": "As Ive said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see,\nis putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isnt The Godfather!If youve\nenjoyed Hollands other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would\nstrongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the \"amazing Spider-Man\"\nversions).Itll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lots of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag\nthough. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happys apartment that plods a little but then were back to it.I think of all\nthe previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendyas is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a\ncouple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience\nneeded answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very\ngood job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do\nI intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didnt give it a 10/10 and\ntherefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether its worth seeing in the cinema.The\nanswer to the first question is that its a very good film but it wont make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot\nthrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesnt quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is\nwell it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You\nwant that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed\ntheatre with a screen which, frankly by todays standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the\ncalibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if youve seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old\nscreen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.",

Spider-mans identity is\nrevealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way\nHome is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises.\nIf you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope\nof the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and\napplauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which\nadds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves\nthe way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is\nfinally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best\nnot to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You wont be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest\nSpider-Man movie Ive ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies Ive ever seen as well. Overall a great film and I\ncant wait to see where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes next.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"The multiverse is a concept of which we know frighteningly little.\"",
    "reviewBody": "Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set\ndirectly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Mans (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor\nStrange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It\nwas always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine\nand millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way\nHome excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is\nundeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCUisms not always particularly gelling\nwell with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas\nof what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peters identity\nbeing revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and\nunderstandably Peters desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and its up\nto Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. Its\nundeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed\nand delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more\nfleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a\ncouple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ocks bridge\nbattle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasnt lying\nabout this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the films\nhighlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure\nspectacle and grin inducingly fun, its just a shame that yet again its another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so\nits frequently hard to see whats going on at certain points.This is probably Hollands best Spider-Man performance as\nhe really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe\nabsolutely steals the film. Hes still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as\nwell, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited\nin this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core\nvalues and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of.\nUnfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I cant help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe\n Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1  2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome\nand Im still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar\nand annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.",

    "reviewTitle": "Peter Parker, giving it all his heart, and everything else...",
    "reviewBody": "The first thing that comes to my mind is how prodigious the script writing is, masterfully layered, epic on countless\nlevels, and moreover deeply emotional... Peter Parker faces extremely complex choices, going through a big number of\nordeals, putting his heart in the front-line all the time... And yeah, it shows you how constantly trying to right every\nwrong is more than a monumental task for one sole being. Luckily, he has several wonderful supports -all along this\nchaotic journey- who give their heart to fill these roles in the best possible way, and that, in itself is very\ntouching... But in this movie, the stakes resonate on a wide number of aspects, it isnt at all just about \"good  bad\",\nits a human story (which makes it the magnificent movie that it is) and the hero at the core of all these meanders has\nto fully embrace his responsibilities... A true heros journey sadly is punctuated with tragic steps that tell you how\nright is what youre doing. And indeed, in the end, it all takes you back to this existential question, and its\nheartbreaking answer : \"What did it cost ?\" ... \"Everything.\"Now on a lighter note, the easter eggs and winks to the\naudience, there are tons of thems and each one of them smoothly flows in the most logical  delightful way with the\nstory (the audience cheers and applaudes on multiple occasions) ; either rewarding you in the process or planting seeds\nfor obvious future storylines to come and develop further down the line... And again, most of these elements have an\nemotional impact to them, or lead you to some intriguing (and interesting) questions...\nWhats for sure is that you go through a lot heart-grabbing moments, all along this movie... It has a lot of epicness to\nit, of course ; but what leaves you in awe is that the emotional aspect of all these scenes is what really leaves you\nblissfully happy. And when the movies over one and for all, you can already enjoy all these clever (but numerous)\nlittle seeds, eventually evolving in new mind-blowing directions in the future...How not to applaude this movie, from\nits great build-up (every character has at least one thing that makes you attached to him and his eventual outcome), the\nway its navigates so well between epic sequences and dialogues that add ever more to the moving aspect of it all ;\nleading you to this legendary last third of the movie, in which anything is a real blast (PS : the two end credits are\nreally worth waiting for).Ill finish with the quality of the whole piece, from the nicely mastered staging, the pace\n(2h30 that flow like 1h), the obvious dedication (and passion) thats infused in every scene by the actors (but also by\nall the team behind the movie ; you can feel it all along) and the dialogs that are a delight... The special effects are\nonce again amazing... The score offers several memorable pieces...\nNot just one of the greatest superhero movies ever, but an unforgettable movie, period.",

Spider-Man fans will enjoy it, even though some of the callbacks are uncalled for.The action is great and the\nvisual effects are better than the previous Spider-Man films starring Tom Holland.Peters character arc is great. He\ndevelops and learns a lot even with the multiverse stuff going on around him.The humour is inconsistent and sometimes\nout of place. Spider-Man and his friends are immature and not very intelligent.

Also Spider-Man couldnt be any stupider, I wont spoil anything but all of his decisions are\nguessable and extremely dumb for the most part. Now lets talk a little bit about the goods because this movie isnt\nbad, the main highlight is the visuals, the film has inception-like scenes and its a feast for the eyes. The actors\nalso do their job and seeing Willem Dafoe without his usual green goblin mask is a great addition, his villainous face\nwas wasted under that piece of metal.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fine movie overall, Spider-Man fans will probably love\nit but I would still recommend it to regular movie goers or people wanting to know what the hype is about, 7/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Forced at times, but overall very satisfying and fulfilling.",
    "reviewBody": "SPOILER FREE.This is an extremely difficult movie to talk about without going into any spoilers. But Ill give it a\nshot.Having been excited and extremely hyped up for this movie (just like the rest of the world) for the last 7 months,\nI went in with extraordinarily high expectations. What I can say is, happily, those expectations were met and even\nsometimes surpassed. More or less everything youd expect from a good spider-man movie is here, and then some. As I\nsaid, this is tough to talk about without mentioning plot.Given that If i could mention spoilers here, I could sit and\ngush about this movie for hours and hours, about all of the ways it is great. But that isnt possible. So instead, Ill\nlet my previous words suffice for the praise I give this movie, and I will move on to what I didnt like, as it is\nsomewhat easier to be extremely vague and subtle when criticising the movie. Whereas praising is nigh impossible at the\nmoment. So, the plot.The plot seems, to me, to be spread extremely thin in places. The reasons given for the things\nhappening in the story are pretty darn weak at times. There are contrivances, and they do sort of stick out. But only\nfor a brief time, because the next scene could have you grinning from ear to ear having forgotten all about said\ncontrivance. However, this doesnt change the fact that some of this feels messy. The movie comes across as being\nEXTREMELY desperate to get to a certain point, and it suffers for it slightly. Given the run time, the fact were still\nrushing here is disappointing.I suppose Its praise worthy that the movie is able to make you roll your eyes in one\nscene, at a particularly forced moment or plot point, and in the next moment, have you giggling with a child-like glee,\nseeing things you only ever wished youd see in the past. And that truly is the strength of this movie. Without\nspoiling, the magic here is what has been pulled off. Pulled off being an important coupling of words. Because that is\nessentially what has happened here, to the credit of everybody involved. It has been pulled off, and is ALMOST the best\nsuperhero movie ever made to date now. Certainly the best Marvel effort, second only to Iron Man 1 possibly.I cant\nreally say much more, as much as I really want to just rip this one apart and spill the insides out for you all, Itd be\nwrong.Just go see this one guys. Trust me. 9/10.",

Seriously, the whole cinema was clapping,\ncheering, crying together as one. This has awoken the child in me and I cried numerous times myself - I rarely cry at\nfilms. Was this fan service? Absolutely. But it was done perfectly.This film is a masterpiece, itll go down as the\ngreatest marvel film of all time and I doubt it can be surpassed. The actors were perfect, their performances were\nphenomenal. I wasnt a great fan of Homecoming or Far from home, but Tom Holland was exceptional in this as was everyone\nelse.Go and see it, you wont be disappointed.

We maybe never see this type of movie ever again. Tom Holland performance\nis same as Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man. TOP TOP TOP LEVEL Performance. Zendaya, Jacob, Marissa Tomei  Jon Favreau\nhaving great performance of their life. Tons of easter egg and the villains just WOW. Willem Defoe played green goblin\nSUPERBLY as expected. Alfred Mollina as Doc Oc is Awesome and fun to watch him. Jamie Fox is funny even funnier than\n\"the first time we saw him\" . The fight scene is awesome, the effect is almost Perfect. Benedict Cumberbatch have very\nMAJOR role is the movie. Yes it is tied to Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness. There is two Credits Scene, Just stay\nuntil it Appear.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply Epic",
    "reviewBody": "I had a lot of expectations going into this movie, I read some non spoiler reviews of it and some of them said its the\nbest movie in the MCU. In my opinion its not, but its very very close, IMHO Thor Ragnorok is virtually perfect. This\ndoes come very very close, in terms of sheer scale its on par with Civil War, some proper geek out moments. I wont\nspoil them, because its totally worth going to see it at the cinema, my biggest nerd moment seemed to be a bit\ndifferent to other peoples judging off the gasps and applause from the audience. Lets just say I like Netflix shows.In\nterms of its epicness I think it falls a little short of Endgame although my two daughters who I went with thought it\nwas on a grander scale to endgame and infinity war. I will leave that to your own judgement.We all now know that Tom\nHolland has signed on again the put the spandex suit on, but this would have been a great ending to Toms tenure as\nSpidermsn, many people are crying out for a more diverse lead character, and they actually comment upon this in the\nmovie.It was a long film so stock up on the snacks and drinks, but to be fair at no point did I think the film was\ndragging its feet to fill the time.In summary a damned good film, up there with the best the MCU has to offer but not in\nmy opinion the GOAT.First post credit scene was amazing, and it still bemuses me after so many MCU Films the amount of\npeople who get up and leave, they dont even put the lights on anymore like they used to. I was rather confused by the\nsecond end credits scene, it wasnt a scene it was a trailer for the next Doctor Strange movie .Now this is the bit of\nmy review that will look very strange if after many years IMDB is still going strong (thanks Amazon) - it was very\ndifficult sitting with a mask on for the whole length of the film, I am also pleased to announce that 99% of the\naudience complied with the order to mask up\nThere was a couple of eejits who were not wearing a mask, and they were not challenged by the staff either (they were\nnot showing exempt notices). To give the @odeonsilverlink some credit, most of the people on the shop floor were\neither at school or college/uni so I wouldnt really expect them to challenge someone for not wearing a mask. It\nshouldnt have to rely on other audience members to say anything, this should be done by the management or\nsupervisorsWell I managed to create a spoiler free review, Im happy with myself.",

It could be a 7 or 8 for people who didnt grow up with Spider-Man. The\nactings are amazing especially Tom Holland, the story is really well written, and the soundtrack is chefs kiss. Of\ncourse there are some flaws and plot-holes, which is why I didnt give 10/10.Without spoiling anything, please do\nyourself a favor and go watch the original Spider-Man trilogy and the two Amazing Spider-Man reboot before watching this\nmovie.",

The villains are great (some better than others) but Willem Dafoes performance as Green\nGoblin steals the show and still sits with me now.

    "reviewTitle": "An Unstoppable Force of Awesomeness! All Hail The New King!",
    "reviewBody": "I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies Ive ever seen. Its almost\nimpossible to convey how pumped I am now that Ive seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when\nexpectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible.\nThat said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldnt be helped. So, I was\ncertainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. Im so happy to report just the opposite has\nhappened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. Its amazing work and everything I had hoped\nfor and more. Its exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure.\nIt has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out\nconflict that arises between team members. Its not a two dimensional \"team wonderful that bands together to fight crime\nho ho ho.\" Most dont like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many\nof these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns arent used to working with other people or\neven playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work \"the other side of the fence\" so to speak. Then theres the\nWidow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all\nthrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire\ncast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is\nthere but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype\ntrain I talked about but Im so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope hes locked up for the long haul\nbecause we dont need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that\nweve seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as\nStark. Hes great but its hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also\nhave to fully disclose that Im insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but\nIm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will\nsurprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly dont\nwant to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do\nyourself a favor and remain unspoiled. Its how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though\nyoure obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness\nfor yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. Im just going to say, Hulk  Thor\ncombination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.",

Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony\nStark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character.\nIt all works. In fact, it doesnt just fit, its a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what\nmakes it truly great. Its why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment.

    "reviewBody": "I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am\nglad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I dont say that lightly. And\nin terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job\nto bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just\nbecause those two didnt really have their individual movie with their back story. You can tell when a comic book fan\nwrites and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film\nI honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But\nWhedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like \"Wow\nthis guy/chick is a badass\" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was\nnever a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulks role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. If any\nof you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story\npresentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought \"Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity\".\nAnd story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just\nout of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. In summation, I dont\nneed to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All\nthis review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I dont say this much but job well done Marvel and\nDisney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic\nfans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in\ngeneral that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!",

It is, as the title of this review says a comic book triumph. I went into the film\nwith very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedons direction and envisioning of the film\ncome to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The\nspecial effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully\nchoreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... its\nno good having them spot on if you dont have a cast that just isnt right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors\ninvolved, Whedons cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and\nthreatening each other all day and night.The actors performances in \"Marvels The Avengers\" are simply captivating and\nthere are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert\nDowney Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through\nsticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvels The\nAvengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again.

    "reviewTitle": "LA Review of The Avengers (No spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "LA Review of The Avengers (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of The Avengers on Saturday\nmorning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks\nbefore its release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon\nwalked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little \"Justice League\" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed.\nlol. If that wasnt enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom\nHiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The\naudience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security\nwere searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early\nSaturday morning screening. Ive never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of\ncomics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron\nMan), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton\n(Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. Capt. Steve Rogers\nwas fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our\nmodern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesnt\nunderstand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing\nmedicine in third world countries. He hasnt been the Hulk in two years (Whats his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the\nsame, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play\nwell together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. The highlight of the film for me is how\nJoss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what\nthe respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great\njob of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever\nanticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly\nlooking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he\nnot only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. The\nmovie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the\nfighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed\noff, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it\nall makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their\npersonality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my\npersonal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST\nBruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Starks) and his\ncompassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel\nsuper hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. Id watch,\nterrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him\nbeing a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didnt know what\nto think of it. I knew that hes a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character\nout of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at\nleast, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. Overall, the best thing\nabout these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye\ncandy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled,\nthey are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally\ncome. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.",

    "reviewTitle": "Beyond Excellent. Avengers Hits At The Highest Level!",
    "reviewBody": "Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing\nmovie. Im so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other\nstudios, theyre making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is\na great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar\nleading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic\nbook genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by\n\"Marvelizing\" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a\ndegree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended\nwas for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it\noff by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel\nleading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work thats come before. Its like\nthe ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he\ngrounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of\neverything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as\nwith any other good film.Ive said it before but its brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big\nbudget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Its a movie that has a\nwonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012,\nquite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I dont see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is\njust that good",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers Assemble",
    "reviewBody": "I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of\nthe film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make\nme think like this is that I didnt love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is\naverage but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the\nsecond Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by\ngentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon\nstyle role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more\nfun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in\npajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing\nstamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an\nexperience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by\nother people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2\nis the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but\nthat does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I\nexpected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics. A\nsubtle phrasing full of a meaning that only comic books fans will understand.",

    "reviewBody": "Ive always loved Marvel films ever since the original Spider man back in 2002 Marvel to me was so much better then DC.\nSpider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldnt be beat. But then Iron Man showed up 6\nyears later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an Avengers film. Then with some other films in order we\nthe fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly\ndeserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give\nthis film its that this film has an ending to it. Me I could watch Iron Man Thor Hulk etc fight evil a million times\nover and it would never get old because Stan the man Lee has created something special with each character in Marvel and\nthose qualities have finally come out in this film",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "I had the extreme pleasure of seeing this movie last weekend at a Facebook fan screening in Hollywood. I waited in line\nfor 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of Writer/Director Josh Whedon, stars Chris\n\"Thor\" Hemsworh Tom \"Loki\" Hiddleston, Clark \"Agent Phil Coulson\", Cobie \"Maria Hill Smulders and Producer Kevin Feige\nand let me just say ... I would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again...The Avengers in one word was\n\"AMAZING\" Josh Whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic\nuniverse !!! The action, humor and story were spot on. The action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and\nput right onto the screen., everything you love about the comics is there and then some. It was immediately obvious that\nthis movie was made by the fans, for the fans... It dozent matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons, everyone will\nfind something to like about this movie. Just be prepared for a roller-coaster ride and a a great time at the movies!I\nhave to say when I first heard Mr. Whedon was attached to direct, as a Buffy and Angel fan I was excited., But he\nsucceeded all my expectations and then some. Anyone says you just cant write a good script with this many actors and\ngive them all their own story arc should attend the Josh Whedon school of screen-writing... Mr. Whedon did a phenomenal\njob of handling each character providing every actor (big and small) their time to shine.The Avengers have assembled...\nand I cant wait to see them again an again !!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Beyond brilliant and beyond awesome, this perfectly plotted and skilfully assembled blend of wit, humour and jaw-dropping action is undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever",
    "reviewBody": "A colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of Marvels The Avengers, the culmination of five\nincredibly successful standalone films over the last four years. Not only has helmer Joss Whedon not cracked under the\nimmense hype, he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that\nhave come before it, combining jaw-dropping action, tongue-in-cheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of\nsummer blockbuster entertainment. Proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts, Wheedon has\ndistilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of Marvel superheroes- Iron Man is wiry\nand snarky as ever; Thor is just as Godly in his might but Human-ly in his compassion; and Captain America is still\nappealingly old-school. The Hulk, or Bruce Banner in his human form, is quite something else altogether though (being\nthe only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films) and very much all the better for it- but\nwell save our gushing for later.It shouldnt come as any surprise that the one movie which Avengers is most\nintimately associated with is Thor, given that both share the same villain- Thors adopted brother and fellow\nAsgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston)- and that Wheedon did shoot the post-credits scene with Loki and S.H.I.E.L.D. director\nNick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Opening with a recurring character from that movie, Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is\nnow assisting with experiments on the Tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its own.Turns out that\nthe fallen Loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of Earth, using the same Tessaract as a portal to\ncross over from their universe to ours- and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, but\nalso the takeover of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Selvig to do his bidding. With the fate of the world in the balance,\nFury activates his Avengers initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others- Black Widow and\nHawkeye. Even from the outset, its clear that there is organic spontaneity in Wheedons storytelling, as he fluently\nweaves together the recruiting exercise by Fury and his trusted agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the participating\nsuperheroes. The best he saves for last, so even though Thor only first appears half an hour into the movie, his is a\nspectacular entrance befitting of that for a God, crossing paths with Iron Man for a thunderous one-on-one clash in the\nmiddle of the woods.True to the spirit of the books, the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note-\nchiefly due to Starks distrust of Fury and disdain for the star-and-stripes-outfitted Captain America. Instead, Stark\nteams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal- Bruce Banner- to locate the Tessaract and uncover\nwhat dirty secrets Fury has been keeping from the rest of them. The answer to the latter isnt all too unexpected, but\nkudos to Wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in Thor. It will take something colossal to\njolt them out of their self- centredness- and believe us when we say that game-changer is certainly massive, counting\nfor the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly\nthrilling stuff youll see on the big screen this year. And just when you think it couldnt get any better, Wheedon tops\nit with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of New York City.The reason why the finale\nworks so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome- Wheedon loves and respects each and every\nsuperhero character just as much. Wheedon gets the action pitch-perfect through reinforcing the individual powers of\neach one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition. It is nothing less than\npure ecstasy when they join forces as a team, and youll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and\ncheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finish.This review however wont be complete without a\nspecial shout-out for the Hulk, many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the Lee Ang and the later Louis\nLeterrier iteration of it. Here, Wheedon has finally gotten it right, blending both the characters brains and brawn to\ncrowdpleasing effect- even more so through some clever plotting that ensures Banners eventual transformation from man\nto beast is as rewarding as it should be. Indeed, theres really no reason why you shouldnt be running out and catching\nthis the first instance it opens. Calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just\nhow brilliant it is, and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far. Filled with wit, humour\nand incredible action, it ranks as one of the most- if not the most- entertaining and exhilarating experiences youll\nhave at the movies this year.",

    "reviewTitle": "They balanced everything masterfully. As Good As It Gets!!!",
    "reviewBody": "If youre a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized\nabout growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and its done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly\nunderstand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there\nassures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie\nreally did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same\ncharacters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much\nto convey in one film. I couldnt be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, theres the\npopcorn fun we were all expecting but theres also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. Its truly a\nstupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan thats been taking\nshape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which weve never seen before and as good of a film thats ever been\nmade in its genre.Theres a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh\nout, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? Its extremely\ndifficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters\nand their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time\nin the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable\nintelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so\nimpressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling\nblock in terms of story but its treated just right. Its also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the\ncharacters to the audience as if youve never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each\ncharacter but even if you missed their solo films, youll still know and care about them in this movie.Its also\nwonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy\nversion of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels\nepic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are\nall huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are\ngoing to make any audience member scream \"BADASS!\" and mean it.Im serious when I say that the big, explosive moments\nare as grand as they should be but its the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level.\nAt this point, weve all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful\nquieter moments is what makes a movie good. Thats the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game\nmovie. Cut out the action and Id still want to see this movie. So, its safe to say that they are replicating the comic\nbook experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic\nbook and comic book fans alike. Thats is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers assembled flawlessly",
    "reviewBody": "Im sorry to say The Avengers isnt a good movie; its a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! Its not only the best team superhero movie\never made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began\nin Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years\nago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared\non screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for\npotentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series\nBuffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team\nof superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers\n(Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye\n(Jeremy Renner) as \"assembled\" by Nick Fury. Whedons scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences\nand an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly\nput on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with\nRobert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark\nalmost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine\nthrough; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very\ngood in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworths Asgardian god\nThor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the films most funny moments. After being\nseriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in\ndeveloping the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; shes as\ndangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet)\nof Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time\nwas Jeremy Renners Hawkeye; happily, hes not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the\ncharacter.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace\nthe silver screen. Id like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play\nHulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks\nmore the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers,\nthe Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the\nopportunity calls for him to \"hulk out\". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for\nme it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury\nis finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Greggs Agent Caulson\nreturns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The\nfilms main villain is Thors adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a\ndifficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a\nfantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because its one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not\na villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a\nrunning-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very\ngood, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other\nfilms (and if so, why not!?!?), were  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling\noverdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason thats backed up with\nincredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed;\neach character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities dont go to waste. The films\nfinale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay\naround for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high\nexpectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the\ninitial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes\nafter the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never\nimagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. Im happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep\nthese properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel\nStudios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because theres never been\nanother movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+",

    "reviewTitle": "A Flat out Exceptional Movie Event. (Best Villain in Years!)",
    "reviewBody": "Im happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. Its not that anyone\nneeds to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this\namazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better\ndevelopment. This also allows them to probe deeper into the characters personalities. This heightens the tension, so\noften missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are\nthrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film thats just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal\nheroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their\nmain villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault\nlines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, thats just shear perfection coming from\nthe god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody whos capable of\nthinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens\nto boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance\ngood.The performances in this movie are as good as any Ive ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that\nacting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the\nother. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that its fun to see them play off each other at different\ntimes in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to\nplay to strengths. Its just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",

    "reviewTitle": "LA Early Screening Review....UNBIASED!! No Spoilers!",
    "reviewBody": "I am not going to go into any spoilers or tell people to go see this movie, I am sure if you are reading these review\nyou are already going to go see the movie. I also will not go into all the awesome things that went down at this early\nscreening in Century City like; an unexpected visit by some major people who were lightly involved with the\nmovie..........nobody that contributed that much..just Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige, Chris Hemsworth, and Loki himself, Tom\nHiddleston but who cares about that, oh wait.....everybody there!!!OK so now for the review....I believe this movie is\neverything it is hyped up to be, I am not going to go into all the things I could praise about this movie because there\nare so many things and it would take awhile. HOWEVER, I will state the two things that I have a minor \"PROBLEM\" with and\nshould be the only \"COMPLAINTS\" about this movie. 1. Joss Whedon said that he CUT the original movie down from 3 HOURS\ndown to 2 hours and 15 minutes, this is something you will definitely notice if you pay enough attention. This leaves\nroom for some \"out of place\" scenes and some fully unexplained situations, but I am guessing it was the studios\ndecision to do this so dont blame Joss because he did a great job with this enormous task. 2. The reason why this film\nmight gain LESS critical ACCLAMATION then dark knight rises, or ANY OTHER comic book movie, is because of the huge load\nof Characters that this movie has to balance. I am not saying they are not handled perfectly, BUT it is still much\ndifferent then a movie with ONE central HERO. All of these main heroes have had their OWN movies, you will need to\nremember this in order to properly weigh how Joss Whedon handled all of them together. Overall, I think almost anybody\nwill thoroughly enjoy this movie, whether you just like action movies or whether you sit around waiting for new Avengers\nnews to come out. I am a big Marvel fan and I was very speculative about this movie on whether it would be a worthy\nrepresentation of the Avengers and it completely delivers. Support this movie so that we can have more and more like it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Movie and Easily the New King of the Genre",
    "reviewBody": "Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best\noverall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up\nfilms that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but Im happy to say this amazing\ncast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time\nto really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was\nanything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character\ntogether and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe its because the characters themselves are complex\nand intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case,\nEVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that\nhave made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then youll define Avengers as great. Its a\nunified step up and I didnt think that possible. Whats also amazing is that I think this movie works without having\nseen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didnt care about the other movies.\nThe depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What theyve done is transcend any\nother of this genres films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again,\neasily the new king of the genre.",

Explosions and giant aliens and no one seems to get killed.Same issues with HULK.\nGreat setup, Mark does a great job of playing Bruce Banner. Outside of the first five seconds of the transformation\nscene we get lame looking CGI Hulk. That moves with the reality of a 50s Warner Bros cartoon!

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers - one of the best superhero film so far!",
    "reviewBody": "Believe me when I say that The Avengers was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes\ngathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The\nmovie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This\nmovie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed\non screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live\nin Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie\nwas over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it\nwas 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they\npaid the $13 to watch it.The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor,\nwants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. Its up to the Avengers to stop\nhim but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are\njust f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.The music\nand soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of\naction. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in\nawe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left\neveryone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene\nwhere Stark and Loki have a confrontation (We have an Army , We have a Hulk). That scene was what did it for me.If\nyou guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you\ndeserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for\nTDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect! Over and Out. 25 April 2012",

    "reviewTitle": "Definitely A Masterpiece by Joss Whedon",
    "reviewBody": "This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over\nsoon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where\nthe action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TVs\n\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel\") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six\nmajor egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of six against one (Loki), wouldnt that be\noverkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of\nits US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts\nare dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and\nNick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics\nDivision) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order!\nYou can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have\nseen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the\nocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to\nsummon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha\nRomanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various superheroes on his massive helicarrier in preparation\nfor war against Lokis forces. These include Steve Rogers Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Starks Iron Man (Robert\nDowney Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)\nmakes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle\ntakes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script\nthat incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien\ninvaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Mans quips when he first meets Thor: \"Whats\nthis, Shakespeare in the park?\" and \"Does your mother know youre wearing her drapes?\" Indeed, the punchlines are more\npowerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are\nalready familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jos Black Widow are introduced\nin an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent\nCoulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away\nwith the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being persuaded by Natasha to join The\nAvengers. On board Furys helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - \"you must have been\ndoing a lot of yoga\" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel\nComics Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the misses of this film is that\nNatalie Portmans Jane is left out of Thors story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Starks relationship\nwith Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six\nsuperheroes, Hiddlestons Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a\nproper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isnt about whether youre\ngoing to catch \"The Avengers\"; its how many times you will want to see it.",

    "reviewBody": "The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain\nAmerica. Heres what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite\na lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let\nhis female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and its about time!)2. For all the\nnewbies out there that havent watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly\nfleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, its possible\nthat the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for\nwhat its worth, isnt it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to\nsome serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if\nyou dont wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. 4. On a side-note, if youre relatively new to the Marvel universe,\nyou must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, its a cartoon, and no, its not a very serious one either. But looking past\nall that, its a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\nreleases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldnt have understood the importance of the post-\ncredits scene without it. 5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!)\nfinally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. Its not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes,\nthere are many scenes which are a fanboys (or girls) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the\nworst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I wont say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but its\nreally very obvious if youve seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog (my\nopinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what weve seen is actually, his best) Whatever the\ngeneral consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel verse (!) and\nhis best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that\nsome important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only\ntoken female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so\nunbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and\nemotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get\nalong with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movies\nbiggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as its\non in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen.",

    "reviewBody": "Marvels Avengers is everything a movie should be, and more. It goes without saying that its the best film of the year\nto date. Theres a serious subtext to the story and great characterization throughout but its focus is on the amazing.\nAs an adventure film, it really has no parallel. When a movie reinvents a popular genre, it speaks volumes. This movie\ndoes just that and accomplishes what theyve promised us since the first Iron Man movie... giving us that \"bigger\nuniverse\" in all its glory. The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting\ncoupled with the writing. Meaning that every character has the perfect dialogue and every quality actor inhabits the\nhero they portray perfectly. Downey has Stark down cold but we knew that already. Hes just given the right stage to\nshine here. Evans finds his pathos and his chops in this film as Steve Rogers. The Boy Scout all-American has an edge\nthis time around. Hemsworths Thor has understandable rationale for joining and doing what he does throughout the movie.\nHis inner turmoil and guilt is exquisite. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the acting chops to hang with any movie villain\nEVER and hes perfect because this is no one dimensional character and his motivation and progression since the Thor\nfilm is seen and felt. Samuel L Jackson actually has something to do in this movie... PRAISE BE! Jeremy Renner is a nice\naddition and even with all the big guns chewing up every scene, he shines. Movie goers will want to see more of his\ncharacter in the future guaranteed. Scarlett Johansson adds to the casting perfection. Shes every bit the complex yet\nsexy female lead and a match for any male on screen. Would you expect any less from a Joss Whedon film? The interaction,\nconflict/turmoil and the relationships all work well and is definitely one of the highlights of the entire movie\nitself.Add some of the best kick-butt action sequences that Ive ever seen and Avengers is what other movies will be\nmeasured to in the years that follow.",

    "reviewBody": "I just saw the movie. I have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now, and a film like this\nshould have been my wet dream. Instead what I saw was a hollow, empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original\ncomic book: an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite (or I should say: thanks to) all the special effects\nand the star power the producers have tried to throw in. The fantasy, the wit, the ideas that were present in the comic\nand that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids, were completely absent in this studio behemoth. I will admit\nthat the recreation of such magic was a difficult task, probably doomed from the beginning: but this thing is completely\nlacking brain, or direction, or any meaning at all. The script is a total and utter disaster, full of bore and\nincredibly shallow, and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar\nbetween themselves. I will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first\ndecent Banner/Hulk: it took only three attempts to the Hollywood writers - and god knows how many millions of dollars\nwasted. Movies like \"Avengers\" are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents, which in\nthis case would be Mr. Mainstream Comics and Mrs. Movie Industry. This leaves them with basically no audience: they are\ntoo much gruesome and boring for kids, too much childish for youngsters, while for the adults - at least for those the\ngrown-up ones - there are just too many capes. The same stories, printed on comic pages, still resonate in popular\nculture after decades: but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down.",

    "reviewBody": "I deliberately avoided seeing any trailers or pictures or anything that might have reduced the impact of The Avengers,\nbut I dont think it would have made any difference. Simply put Joss Whedon has succeeded where so many others have\nfailed in the past, most notably DC Comics,to bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screen,without\nalienating the fans or confusing the newbies, and seemingly the hardest task, to make it a good movie. An indication of\nhow he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter, who gets dragged to all the Iron Man, Green Lantern, etc, movies\nwith me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly (mostly). However after leaving The Avengers she declared\nit her favourite movie ever. I cant comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the\nprevious Marvel/Avengers Characters movies, but I think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who\nIron Man, The Hulk and Captain America are, you should be able to work the rest out from there. I saw it in 3D and it\nwas good, but I wouldnt say the 3D is a must. But I would say see it on the big screen, and see it as soon as you can!",

    "reviewBody": "The critics so far are basically right about what makes it great. Virtually all of the reviewers have said it has\nexcellent dialogue and great action set pieces.No one who is a fan of fantasy action movies could seriously deny how\ngood this is as an action spectacle: the special effects are very good, and put to good use by Whedon and his team. The\ntracking shot through the midst of the final battle is amazing. The finale is a genuine classic battle scene, and is as\ngood as anything that Steven Spielberg would have put together in the same circumstances.The movie is funny enough that\nIMDb should add comedy to its genre list. And all the other things the critics are repeating (so far, anyway) are\ntrue: mostly good acting, Ruffalo is especially good as Banner, character interactions are done very well, everyone gets\nenough to do that it feels like an ensemble movie, all of the title characters from the prior films are portrayed as\nwell, or better than, in their own films blah blah blah...So all the good stuff weve been hearing/reading is basically\ntrue. What about the bad? Theres less consensus around the bad, but probably general agreement that the plot as such\nisnt all that. Its basically the story as told on the cover of The Avengers comic #1: a team of powerful, but not\nunstoppable, individuals gather together to fight a foe no hero could stop alone. As Time Outs reviewer noted, the plot\nis basically just a coat-hanger for Whedon to build his character arcs and action sequences. But The Avengers was always\nlikely to be limited by the need to be an origin story of sorts, and so I wasnt really expecting a lot more from the\nplot on this occasion; and the storytelling itself is very good, the way the character arcs were moved forward and\nentwined, was done very well. The alien army was an adequate, but not very innovative way to get Loki reinforcements and\nget a big battle for the heroes at the climax.The beginning was a bit clunky (several reviewers have used exactly that\nword) and I dont think it was a very helpful way to get audiences who hadnt seen the build-up movies into the\nfilm.There are potentially interesting themes of control, power and freedom (as Patrick Samuel touched on in his review\nat Static Mass Emporium), but these are not given sufficient fleshing out, leaving the movie in the summer blockbuster\ncategory, albeit a much, much better than average example of that kind.Oh, and Ill say it again: The official title is\nstupid.But overall, Id give it a 9/10. (Probably a 7 to 8 for those who havent read the comics or followed the movie\nfranchise closely.)",

Will Robert Downey Jr. ever get back to the brilliance\nof Iron Man 1 or have cocky dialogs won over a cool plot? b.) Mark Ruffalo as the hulk? Why not Edward Norton? c.)\nHawkeye \" not a superhero but just a guy with good aim. Black Widow \" no powers again.is she just for eye-candy? d.)\nWill Hemsworth get more screen time and a better plot than what Thor offered him? e.) Loki the main villain \" is this\ngoing to be yet another Thor vs Loki battle with the others just chipping in? f.) Will too many superheroes dilute the\nplot  will they be eating up each others screen time? g.) Is technology going to win against a good storyline once\nagain? (Ref: All the other Transformer films except the 1st!) h.) So many of them..will Iron Man hold fort in the\n\"team\"?Honestly I didnt even care for Evans and Captain America as much as I did for Thor  Iron Man. And I must say\nwith the runtime being 145 minutes, I wondered if it would be a drag.THE VERDICTThe movie takes time to settle into the\nplot  setting up the characters, unlike Thor were I felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much\nmore.The film IS LARGER THAN LIFE. Unlike Iron Man 2 or Captain America which left me wishing they had done more.Loki\ndoes a great job of portraying the villain. Thor delivers, Black Widow  Hawkeye are manageable. But nothing can compare\nto the fact that Ruffalo actually fits this version of Hulk way better than Norton could have done. And of course, Iron\nMan rocks. Rocks like he never did.By the time you reach the second half, the story has built in enough punch to make\nyou wish there was an epic battle to follow and not a lame effort. And it does deliver. Great action, lot of mayhem,\nevery superhero getting his screen time.Hulk  Iron Man indeed steal the show. Good dialogs  well timed comic quips\nhere and therea perfect start to the 2012-13 tent-pole league. Now if only The Hobbit  Dark Knight Rises keep up to\nthis level, its gonna be a great year! :)",

After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to\nhigh enough.The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. Its all pretty\nusual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos\nflying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark.\nIts in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasnt expecting: a family\ncomedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be\nhad by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain Americas and Thors expense are great (\"Easy\nthere Point Break\") with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the films climax, Hulk gets\nmost of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the films main weakness, Marvel\nhad already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lees 2003 version being one of the most\nunderrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the films biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great\nBruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time\never that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and\napplause when Chris Evans delivered the line: \"Hulk, SMASH!\" and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.A few of the\nnew characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett\nJohanssons Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renners\nunbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4\nMarvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure\nher sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the\nStan Lee cameo is present of course.Which brings us to the films action sequences. They are astounding.Like\nTransformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America\ntry to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then theres the climactic\n\"glorious war!\" which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The\nproblem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the\nadversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can\nthrow any enemies you want at The Avengers.The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero;\nbrilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedons directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster\nmold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other\nand uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being\ndumb or \"kiddy\" (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to\npersonal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to\nits better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.My one BIG problem with the film was\nthe untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool\nto evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous\ntimes he wasnt even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of\nrelationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a\nlarge mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe.\nPerhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can\nonly hope.Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google \"Thanos\" and\nthe \"Infinity Gauntlet\" when you get home.All in all it was GREAT fun  I honestly can not wait for Whedons Directorss\nCut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to\nincorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these\ncharacters.REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many\nyears to come.9/10 Well and truly Assembled.",

    "reviewTitle": "Epitome of a Comic Book Movie",
    "reviewBody": "**SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM**So last night I attended the Australian premiere of \"The\nAvengers\" and yes, this was the most entertaining and impressively \"THORsome\" movie that Ive ever seen. Like most comic\nbook fans, I was looking forward to this since Nick Furys appearance at the end of \"Iron Man\", so there was great hype\nand expectation. This movie is the epitome of a comic book being brought to life - the action scenes were surreal, the\nemotional content was tranquil, and somehow, Joss Whedon managed to add in a mere perfect story line and a charade of\ncomedic lines for each of the amazing characters.Sublime performances were put in by all the main actors, but special\nmentions must go to Mark Ruffalo, who in my opinion, played the perfect Bruce Banner (I was never a fan of Edward Norton\n- sorry), and Tom Hiddleston, whos Loki was devastatingly cruel and yet charming in the same manner. In the case of\nBanner, Ruffalo portrays him in such a way that we are reminded that there is a darker, more sinister side to this man\nthan the calm and reserved doctor in the room. Of course Robert Downey Jr.s presence is always felt on screen and\nnothing changes in this movie, as he delivers most of the hilarious dialogue (at one point he even recited Shakespeare\nwhile fighting Thor in the forest). There is not one single dull or wasted scene in this movie, every single one has its\npurpose, whether it be filled with witty dialogue or explosive action. An example of the aforementioned dialogue: Thor:\n\"Loki is beyond reason, but he is my brother\" Black Widow: \"Your brother just killed 80 people in the last two days\"\nThor:\".....hes adopted...\" At which point everyone in the cinema erupted with laughter. Of course my favorite was Thor,\nwho engaged in an intense battle with the Hulk on board the Helicarrier.Essentially, \"The Avengers\" takes us on a roller\ncoaster ride, through emotional highs and lows of all the characters. One of the interesting components was seeing how\nmembers of the team would react when they were in the same room, and the portrayal of ego clashes did not disappoint.\nSPOILER ALERT: It takes a while for the dynamics of the Avengers to settle, catalyzed by the death of Agent Coulson. But\nonce they assemble, the ending action sequence is simply awe-inspiring. The Hulk proves there is nothing he cannot smash\n(including Loki), Chris Hemsworths Thor gave most of the audience a massive \"THORgasm\" by summoning all that thunder\nand lightning from Mjolnir, Captain American/Black Widow/Hawkeye more than hold their own against a formidable foe, and\nRobert Downey Jr.s Iron Man steals the show by proving that he is a team player and sacrificing himself to nuke the\nportal of the Chitauri. And what Avengers movie would be complete with that circling camera shot of the team preparing\nfor battle while standing in a back to back formation, with Iron Man initially hovering over them. The background music\nmade that moment PERFECT. If I did have one complaint, it would be the lack of background narrative showing how Thor\nreturns to earth, although Loki does deduce that Odin must have conjured dark magic for Thor to return. However, the\nmid-credits scene was mind-blowing, revealing Thanos as the mastermind behind Lokis invasion and setting up a possible\nstoryline for \"The Avengers 2\". In conclusion, this was one of, if not the best movies that I have ever seen. Thanks for\nreading and enjoy the movie!!! =]",

    "reviewTitle": "Was it great? No. Good? Only just...",
    "reviewBody": "Lots of money, lots of CGI, high-powered cast, half-assed story. That about sums up the latest Joss Whedon\nextravaganza.**spoilers** The story: clunky. It doesnt flow easily. Joss Whedons script is okay, and even hints at\ndeeper themes, but is ultimately a bit tacky and shallow. Some welcome laughs here and there, but pretty average\nscripting.IMDb at time of writing has it at 8.6. 8.6? Not even close. Flat 7 at best. Im giving it 5 because, for all\nthat money (and there was a hell of a lot of it), its a pretty poor effort.Big time films seem to be in a trend of\nhaving convoluted stories rather than great storytelling, and The Avengers follows that trend. The whole \"causing\ndissension among the ranks\" fails significantly because it relies on the super-heroes forgetting all the struggles \npersonal growth theyve been through in previous films. The Avengers tries to present them as reluctant, and egotistical\n(which of course they luckily overcome), but theyve already been through things like this in their own films. Why have\nthey regressed? Perhaps the reason is that Hollywood largely eschews the time-tested concept of character growth for\nflashy SFX that the kiddies like so much. Its sad, and results in hollow films. Like The Avengers, for example.The CGI:\nPretty good, but has flying worms ala the latest Transformers flick, but not as cool.The cast: Not too bad. Scarlett\nJohansson in a tight outfit, and the usual cast of Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans etc etc.Overall, its got high-wattage\nstars, lots of CGI, and not much impact, tension or heart.Better than Battleship (as if that was hard), not as good as\nIron Man 1. Enjoyable and immediately forgettable. Itll make loads of money and probably even a sequel.",

    "reviewBody": "I went today to the 3d version of the movie in Antwerpen Belgium. Let me start to say it is very entertaining and its\nalmost more a comedy than a Marvel Movie. Why i not rate this movie higher is because there a lot of flaws in the\nstoryline and they step over a lot of issues to easy. Iff you compare that for example with X-Men First class or Ironman\nthe story lines are much better so i dont really understand why the reviewers before me dont talk about that enough.\nThe enemy is very weak(almost a single shot would kill them) and i still dont understand why Loki was doing in the\nplane and why he would let them catch him... And the attackers were saying that there boss would come what happened with\nhim ? Also no variation in the enemy and what about the hoovering cockroaches who only flew against buildings did\nnothing. From characters the black-widow was pointless she is just shooting with a gun and Hawkeye is shooting with a\nbow how is that faster than a gun. This movie was saved in the first part by Tony Stark character extremely funny and\nthe Hulk character in the second part of the movie. But how Hulk came a very smart monster who knows what hes doing i\nstill dont know. But still its a movie worth going to the cinema but its def. not a movie which is worth a 8.4",

    "reviewBody": "OK so this is my first review Ive done so sorry if it isnt grade A standard.Ill start off by saying before you see\nthis movie make sure you watch the movies that lead up to The Avengers it doesnt take away from the experience but\nyoull get to know the characters better and add depth to them all. The 3-D nothing special maybe one part that did it\nwell but other then that just your usual converted 3-D. The characters were good Tom Hiddleston (my opinion) out shines\nthem all except for Robert Downey Jnr but maybe its because Im a big fan of Robert and Mark Ruffalo performed well.\nThere is some good comedy in there even during the final battle. One problem I had though was with Captain America suit,\nI know its part of him and from the comics but I felt like I couldnt take him seriously and by the end of it Hulk\ndidnt feel like Hulk I would explain but I feel like it would spoil things. That being said though I still enjoyed the\nmovie. Please take into concern this is MY opinion dont take it seriously, people like different things. Thank you for\nyour time.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Fan Service",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in\nthe big screen. While the heroes stand alone films doesnt have that enough action, this movie executes more of their\nsuper abilities. Its really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what\nall fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you\nwill crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full\nof explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but its necessary.\nThe storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they\ndevelop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and\nentertaining. Its more entertaining when theres Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like\nthis. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the\nperformances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain\nAmerica. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. Shes still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the\nsecondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk\nto smash them. But it doesnt matter because theres Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is\nsimply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. Its suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes.\nIts exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While theres Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain\nAmerica throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. Its\nfantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the\naction and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and\ncheer to them. Its a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun\ncharacters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch.\nThis film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the\nbest of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvels Avengers: Joss Whedon Im officially your number 1 Fanboy and a believer",
    "reviewBody": "Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results\nhave been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didnt expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best\ncomic-book movies ever \" Iron Man. If it wasnt for DCs own Billionaire playboy superhero wouldve champion Iron Man as\nthe best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1  2 were good but didnt exactly capture\nthe essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless.\nLast years motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their\nrespective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the\nsilver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitives proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvels\nmotion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008s The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the\nfranchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on\nits own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits\nlike Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005s Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos,\nhandling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top\nbrass executive down to the hardcore fanboys \" to be honest, I wouldnt have entrusted him with a fraction of the\n$200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and\naccomodated several superheroes in a single movie \" Bryan Singer (X-Men  X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class)\nwhile Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more\nterrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming\nX3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud:\nJOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development\nthroughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You\nare wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters\nare far from underdeveloped and dont crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything its the\nHulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he\nabsolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and\nevery character gets a fair amount of screen time. I cant find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects\nare spectacular but its the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two\nmemorable lines \" not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully \" Ive\nnever heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and Ive watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking\nman. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie \" they were wrong. From now on\neveryone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized\nextravaganza \" Yeah Im slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon wouldve done justice to the\nfranchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. Final\nverdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!",

These\ncharacters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded\nme of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along.\nAs the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this\nwith my 10 year old nephew.

    "reviewBody": "Ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A WINNER! Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try\nto cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black\nleather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and\nthe interaction of every character just enough. Maybe its the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be\nintroduced in their own movies or maybe its because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and\nbelievable. Its truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans\nof other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because\nof the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really\nclick. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing\ndisplays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the\nshear number of characters. Whats also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional\nweight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you\na remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease\nat the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I cant thank them enough for that factor. They\nknew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVENT\nSEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise. Avengers is a complete and very well done movie and as\nmuch fun as Ive ever had in the cinema. Thats no lie or no joke.",

    "reviewBody": "The Avengers is exactly what I expected. It is action packed, it understandably doesnt have much time for character\ndevelopment (although we do see more of Hawkeye and Black Widow than in previous Marvel installments), and the\nrelentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there - especially by Tony Stark\nand, surprisingly, the Hulk (they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around Hulks utter\nbrutality).The lack of character development, especially for Thor (who does seem somewhat out of place in this film) but\nalso Bruce Banner, is probably what hurts The Avengers the most. I didnt actually need any character development since\nIve seen all previous Marvel films at least twice, but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback - it feels wrong even\nthough I was expecting it considering the number of characters already established. I can hardly imagine anyone who\nhasnt seen the previous films enjoying The Avengers because of that.I usually dont care that much for relentless CGI\naction films, but some sequences in The Avengers were so blatantly incredible that I had to enjoy them. Notably, a\nsequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one Avenger kicking butt to the other - that was really well\ndone and exciting. Loki was once again a brilliant villain and the perfect choice for the first Avengers film.Overall, a\nvery good action ride bringing our favorite superheros together. The movie doesnt try to be pretentious and goes\nstraight to business - which is what it should do.",

All the actors did a great job\nportraying their role, and the visual effects are amazing, my favorite character in this movie is \"Hulk\", I mean I hate\nhim in the other movies, but in this film, whoa hes great, hes strong and heavy (Funny when he smash \"Thor\"), and\nBlack Widow, whoa... shes not only hot but shes also dangerous, well overall it was an amazing experience. I wanna see\nit again, Ill rate it a 8.5 over 10! ASSEMBLE!",

    "reviewBody": "I just came out of the cinemas from watching it on the first day and I have to admit it was better than I expected. I\nexpected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes, and thats what you get, world class entertainment. I\nenjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning. Also this movie has a chunk of comedy,\nnot the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the\nseriousness of the film (too much). It was clich but what can you expect. The actors are flawless and keep up with who\nthey are meant to be. The only part I really didnt like, but also didnt expect was the lack of feeling. A lot of the\ngood movies I watch I come out feeling different, like the movie has effected me, but I felt nothing, (except for one\npart but it wasnt enough to give a real feeling to the movie). All in all, this is an action packed movie, sure to give\nyou entertainment, not boring at all, funny, has some smart moments and a must see movie for anyone.",

    "reviewTitle": "Its Iron Mans world and the rest of the Avengers just live in it, apparently...",
    "reviewBody": "As one of the seemingly few whos not a fan of the Iron Man character or his films, and after seeing the trailers, I had\nmy reservations about this film. Was it going to be Iron Man 3, guest-starring the rest? Well, yes and no. Its clear\nwho Joss Whedons favourites are, as they get the most character development. Those who come out on top: Tony Stark (of\ncourse), Black Widow and (surprisingly) Bruce Banner/Hulk. If youre a fan of these characters/the actors who portray\nthem, then you should be satisfied with their amount of screen time.Fans of Stark, who dont mind his attitude and want\nnothing more than his mumbled speedy snarky lines/blowing stuff up will be the most pleased. Annoyingly, even his love\ninterest gets to be the only one to appear in this film (too bad for Peggy Carter  Jane Foster, both of whom I greatly\nprefer as characters. Though at least we get to see a *picture* of them and its mentioned that Janes safe. I wish Thor\nhad been allowed to reunite with her before he left again). RDJ does his thing, and hes naturally fine doing it, but\nIm probably in the minority who prefers him as Sherlock in his Sherlock Holmes films.Captain America thankfully gets to\nretain his likability, calls Tony out on his BS (theres more than one scene of two verbally sparring) and has his\nmoments of leadership. I was annoyed, however, that his practical costume from CA: TFA was replaced with one that looked\nlike the comical outfit he wore when promoting war bonds during the Star Spangled Man song/dance number in his solo\nfilm. Its pretty clear Whedon views him as a dork of sorts, so hes reduced to the butt of jokes and not getting to\nbe cool like Stark. Even with Whedons clear bias against him, Steve continues to be the most likeable/noble\nhero.Scarlett Johansson gets to kick sufficient ar$e as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and does a good job of subverting\nthe obvious (something Whedon is a fan of...along with scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other). There\nare a few moments where it appears shes beaten/showing signs of weakness, but then she turns things on their head and\nshe proves herself to be no damsel and more than capable/not to be underestimated. The one somewhat regressive role\nWhedon sticks her in is beauty taming the beast in regards to her character and the Hulk.Speaking of the other\nguy(as Bruce calls him), this Hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions thanks to motion-capture allowing\nMark Ruffalo to actually portray the not-so-jolly green giant and even his face bears resemblance to Ruffalo. Bruce gets\nto be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie, but when he eventually Hulks out, he does plenty\nsmash-o-crash. Unfortunately, Hulk is also played for some rather immature laughs at times, like when he punches Thor\nafter theyve just teamed up to take down a baddie (why? Because its \"FUNNY\"!) or he cuts Loki off mid-speechifying by\ntossing him around like a ragdoll, thus kinda undoing all the effort Tom Hiddleston put into making Loki menacing\n(theres one exchange he has with Natasha where he comes across truly evil). Its clear Whedons not a fan of god-like\ncharacters and hopes to sway others to be like-minded.Nick Fury gets to be sneaky/manipulative, jumps on the Lets\nblame Thor train and shoots stuff, as does his offside, Agent Hill (Cobie Smulders), when shes not providing\nexposition or miraculously escaping death. Hawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends the majority of the film\nzombiefied by Loki, but is eventually freed of the mind-control and his backstory with Natasha is briefly touched upon.\nEven Agent Coulson gets a fair amount of development. Disappointingly, Thor gets the short end of the stick...or hammer.\nId thoroughly enjoyed his solo movie and Chris Hemsworth in the role, so I was hoping hed get the respect/focus he\ndeserved as part of this ensemble cast...but it seemed Tony Starks one-liners and the Hulk beating Asgardian ar$e for\nlaughs was Whedons priority, sadly.Poor Thor never seems to be allowed to have a true victory in the film, which is a\nreal disappointment since his character had undergone a true heros journey in his own film and deserved to be taken\nseriously, rather than disrespected/treated as the butt of jokes. Sure, he and Mew Mew get to kick a fair amount of\nbutt, but not nearly enough as they *shouldve*. He doesnt even get to be the one who takes down Loki (his\nbrother...whos adopted) in the end and save everyone, as that victorys given Iron Man and Hulk, of course (and Thor\nhad been about to save Starks ar$e at the end too until Hulk swooped in and stole his thunder). Such a shame that Thor\ngets screwed over, but I appreciated his little moments of humour (all the more effective because they *arent* OTT or\nat the expense of others) and that he brought some actual seriousness to proceedings/his complicated sibling\nrelationship with Loki wasnt entirely ignored.Despite my few quibbles, the film surprisingly comes together pretty\nwell. Whedon proves he can direct action with the best of them and its blissfully free of overuse of shaky-cam. Its\nquite the feat, bringing all these characters from different films together and actually making it *work*, but he pulls\nit off. Not a dollar of the movies considerable budget has been wasted. Its all up there on the screen, the humour\nworks (some of the time), all the actors do well in their roles, but I personally wouldve liked to have spent more time\nwith Cap  Thor and exploring their reluctant partnership (how about a buddy film?). Im more invested in their own solo\nfilms than seeing them sharing time with characters who Im not a fan of, but not opposed to seeing the Avengers\nreassemble.",

    "reviewBody": "Yep, Ill be honest, I did cringe a little when I found out Joss Whedon was directing, I absolutely love his work but I\njust could not see how his talents would be able to be used to make this sort of film. I am so happy to say that I was\nwrong! The film allows you to enjoy every moment as it passes especially when at the end you realised youve just sat\nthrough 2 hours and 20 minutes of concentration.Like you expect, were all re-introduced to all the characters, one by\none off doing their own thing and S.H.I.E.L.D trying to bring them all together. The good thing about this is when they\ndo all eventually start to get together you get the all too normal tension between a group of individuals being almost\nforced together with the expectations from S.H.I.E.L.D that they automatically work together as some fantastic team.\nAside from all the action scenes, explosions, fights etc etc You still get the storyline the whole time, if you step\nback and look at the whole storyline you realise that its a pretty semi-typical script but the whole film you dont\neven realise thats happening, it really brings comic films to a new meaning. The biggest adjustment for myself and Im\nsure many other viewers was the role of Tony Stark/ Iron Man. Though Downey Jr reprised the role fantastically (no\nsurprise), both Iron Man films had kept to the human story lines, The Avengers introduced the film character into the\nworld of science fiction. With the Iron Man films you could keep some sort of natural relationship with the storyline\nand characters because all was somewhat believable (in the Action movie sense). But with saying that as you watch the\nmovie and you make your own adjustments to this, so is Stark himself so it ties in perfectly with the audience which is\nanother hats off moment for Whedon.Another fantastic thing and is one of the defining points of this film, is the\ncomedic input. Almost every comic film is known as being all action and drama, you feel like you have to be serious the\nwhole time (ofcourse minor funny moments but nothing good), Joss Whedon has taken account the audience and the 21st\ncentury and made some key scenes in the film so much better and less awkward, it had the entire cinema erupt in\nlaughter. Though with saying that, and you reading it might make you stand off-ish, the way its worked into the scene\nit would be just as impressive even if it was just kept to a dramatic scene.This film had chance of being really well\nmade or an absolute laughable flop. It has impressed me and it has impressed many many other people, I look forward to\nhearing further reviews as it opens in cinemas around the world. The writers, directors, producers and the cast have\nall worked together amazingly and I cannot wait for future projects!",

    "reviewTitle": "A great merge of many great movies",
    "reviewBody": "As many, I have been waiting for this film since ages. As I was quite fond of all the previous Avenger movies, I\nobviously had great expectations, some were fulfilled and some were not. The movie started quite thrilling. Bringing in\nthe Chitauri was brilliant, I kinda wish they would have got a bigger part in the story than just being the bad-ass\nalien army to defeat. But of course, as the film had so many things to expand it would have been a little bit too much.\nAnd that was quite the bad point in the movie, even though I was expecting it to happen. With so many main characters\nand with all their background stories, there was not enough time to unfold everything that was behind the story. By that\nI mean, some of the characters were not even near as complex as in the previous movies. For example, I think Thor turned\nout to be pretty one-sided in this film. I really liked the movie Thor and while it was obvious that most characters\nwere not going to be in this one, I still missed Hopkins, Portman and Dennings, mostly because the character of Thor was\nmore like the angry prince like in the beginning of the movie Thor, rather than the wise king he had became in the end\nof it. Another problem the amount of characters brought up was that the movie was a bit too fast. Unlike the calmer\nnature of the original films, in this one there was always something happening, mostly fight scenes. I love fight scenes\nand usually enjoy them to the most, but only with a fine balance of them and calmer moments. Of course in short terms,\nit was very amazing and exciting, but when it came to the death scene of Coulson, as Fury sat next to him in silence had\nI only realized how tired one can get of seeing almost nothing but battles for an entire movie. Yet, as Ive said\nbefore, with so many characters making this film calmer would have been simply impossible. The acting otherwise was\nreally nice, the crew seemed to do their best during the whole film. Smulders was a pleasant surprise, she was truly\nmarvelous in the role of Agent Hill. Ruffalo was just as well a good exchange of Norton, he made the character of Bruce\nBanner very likable. The scores also did catch up to the spirit of the film pretty well, the music kept you in the mood\nduring the whole time. As for the amazing sides of the film, the visuals were utterly cutting-edge. 3D effects were not\nthat outstanding though, guess it still does not really worth the headache. For a sequel (as I hope one will happen in\nthe near future), I just hope that they will have more space and time to expand the characters personalities a bit more\nprecisely. As for the first film to merge all these stories, I dont think they could have done any better. Maybe not\nthe best directing nor the best superhero movie of all time, but for sure is a fun film to watch with many great moments\nand good acting. A must-see for all Marvel fans.",

    "reviewTitle": "A rollicking good ride.",
    "reviewBody": "Four years ago Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury appeared in Iron Mans end credit scene and whipped the comic book\ngeek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since\nthen weve witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled\nin self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show:\nThe Avengers. It was worth the wait.Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action,\nlaugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether its the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in\nthe forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the\nbruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and,\nalong with the series best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted\nwith such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark \" the Hulks reaction to Loki\nbelittling him had me in tears \" and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps\nin plot. However, perhaps Whedons most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who\ncontinue their great work from the franchises previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never\nover-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad\nslow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments. Bring on the sequel.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Perfectly Crafted Super Hero Movie",
    "reviewBody": "So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They dont exactly get along or have much\nappreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up,\nstarting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has\nbeen a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this\npoint.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at\nthe bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life\ncharacter who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With\na great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a\ngreat cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the\nfun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was\nnot quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the\nfurniture. Captain American, as a movie didnt work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not\nenough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too\nserious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With\nthe much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a\ngigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest\nelement in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the\nabove and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is\npriceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background\nscenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and the other guy. The special\neffects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings.\nWith the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not\nquite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the\nbanter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett\nJohansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in\nmarvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise\nand respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has\ndefinitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and\nthis really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon\nconstantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull\nmoment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a\nperfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is\nbrimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel\nfrom Marvel! Go Joss!! filmnotion.com",

    "reviewBody": "The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. Ill\nsave that for a later date because it really isnt important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, its\nthe best time Ive had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it\noperates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clichd about the film. They establish\ntheir own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If youve seen them all,\nyoure in for a real treat with Avengers. If you havent, youll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They\nfearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and\nscene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the\nworld and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful,\njust like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a\nreason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes\nthe film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and theres plenty of\nit, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as\ngood and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of\nten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much\nthey were paid not to like an instant classic.",

    "reviewTitle": "Very entertaining. Superhero ensemble done right.",
    "reviewBody": "Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude\nof characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki\n(Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful\nindividuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot\nof friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with\nthe rest simply playing supporting roles. They neednt have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of\nattention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet\nwell-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve\nRogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Lokis stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy\nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in \"Thor\" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the\nmost interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the\nrole surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson\n(Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts\n(Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders),\nwho doesnt really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best\nperformance by far is by Hiddleston. As the films primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at\nthe audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man\nbehind \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" and \"Firefly\", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice\nfor this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major\ncharacter, to the films many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the films\nspecial effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous\nlive-action portrayal, Lokis army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are\ncreated that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a\nmysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future\ninstallments). While it wont win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven\nstory with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice,\nand will thrill audiences from beginning to end.",

    "reviewTitle": "Words cannot describe how good this movie is!! A MUST SEE",
    "reviewBody": "I have to say this movie was out of this world. Exactly what any big fan of comics or of all the marvel movies wanted.\nThere was just enough of every character involved. I know a large debate can be had on the characters not being like\nthey are in the comics or the plots being different but behind it all they cant just make a really long boring movie\nwith every detail involved!! Its definitely not a movie for the person who doesnt like the previous movies. The acting\nof Robert Downey Jr was brilliant and the addition of the new hulk Mark Ruffalo was even better. It could been debated\nthat Ed Norton would of been better but if you ask me personally the new hulk was outstanding! The movie experience in\n3D was also very good. I am not a huge fan of 3D movies from the past, but after watching the avengers, marvel did a\ngreat job in all the action scenes where they took full use of the 3D effects. Over all its a must see action/adventure\nmovie. 10/10",

    "reviewBody": "OK, I know 10/10 scores are thrown in too lightly n ow a days, but hear me out, this movie is truly astonishing.\nFollowing the storyline directly from Thor 2011, this movie starts strong with Loki trying to conquer earth, from there\nits just a wild ride, it grips on you and you wont be able to catch your breath until way after the credits.The thing\nthat I appreciate the most, is that its a true SuperHero movie, often in comics adaptations, the directors try to ground\nthe actions and powers, worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium. Well, not here, The action is\nunbelievable, the feats of strength breathtaking Ironman shoots its repulsor beams, Thor uses his lightning\nstrike.Lastly it wouldnt have worked without the humor, Wheedon, has perfect chops, each time his punchlines will take\nyou off guard, and trust me laugh you will.I watched this in a really packed theater, the function was sold out one week\nbefore, a record in my country. Everyone was cheering, laughing, clapping and wowing. a truly special spectacle.Really\nF***ING Amazing.",

    "reviewTitle": "The very definition of crowd pleaser.",
    "reviewBody": "Anzac day. Public holiday. Late night session. Not an empty seat in the house. The atmosphere was at a deserved premium\nfor the years most anticipated film, and The Avengers did not disappoint. The king of sci-fi television, director Joss\nWhedon (Buffy, Firefly) enlists the help of one Samuel L. Jackson in assembling Earths mightiest heroes to protect\nhumanity against the greatest threat to our existence in history. Sounds pretty stockstandard, right? It should, because\nThe Avengers makes no move towards trying to reinvent the genre, but rather takes everything that makes a film like this\nenjoyable and cranks it to eleven, proving theres some life in the blockbuster yet.All is peaceful on planet Earth with\nthe all-powerful Cosmic Cube safely in the hands of Nick Fury and SHIELD. That is until Loki, Thors evil half-brother\nfrom another realm, storms the castle and commits larceny of the grandest scale. His actions convince Fury that the\nworld is indeed at war, and he is left with no choice but to reinstate the Avengers Initiative. With it, he brings\ntogether The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and the big cheese Iron Man to take down this mighty foe.\nUnfortunately, all signs point to the superheroes killing each other before saving the Earth. Cause, you know,\npriorities.The films unquestioned drawcard has always been its ensemble cast and, more importantly, the potential for\nspectacular chemistry between the leads. This forced sceptics to beg the question: How long will this gimmick last\nbefore everyone starts to get in each others way? The final product allays such concerns with ease, as Whedon, his\nfellow writers and the actors all deserve equal credit for their depiction of the superteam as the ultimate\ndysfunctional family. To the mere mortal, a superhero can appear angelically honourable and beyond reproach. Throw four\nof five of them into one room and they become stubborn, irritable and deviously arrogant just like the rest of us.\nWatching this dynamic progressively unfold throughout the film is a treat, as the Avengers bicker over almost anything,\nall with a watch-me-prove-Im-better-than-you macho attitude. A witty script almost entirely devoid of clichs that\nallows room for sufficient individual character development certainly helps this dynamism. Stark copes with fighting for\nsomething greater than himself for once, Banner draws sympathy as a brilliant mind struggling with a crippling case of\nsplit personality and the contrasting ideas Thor and Loki possess regarding freedom, arguably the films most prominent\ntheme, all contribute to the films depth without disrupting the excellent pacing.Walking into this film in the right\nframe of mind, one would find most minor flaws few and far between. Not every one-liner or scripted joke hits the mark,\nin typical Marvel fashion, and Cobie Smulders character comes off as underused and unnecessary in stark contrast (no\npun intended) to her prominence in the trailers. Kudos must also go to the execution of the megascene, that is, the\nforty-minute climactic battle between the Avengers and Lokis army. While it is certainly nothing new, the megascene has\nbecome more and more of a staple in major action franchises of late, including the last Harry Potter and Transformers\nfilms. The ambitious nature of the set piece by sheer design means things can get ugly and repetitive in a hurry if care\nis not taken to ensure the audience is engaged at all times (see: Dark of the Moon). With The Avengers, though, the\nfinal act is not only visually fascinating, but also mentally stimulating, constantly jumping between various settings\nand characters involved, with new developments occurring every couple of minutes to ensure one doesnt even come close\nto losing interest. After a string of commercially dominant but critically indifferent projects, it appears Marvel has\nfinally hit the jackpot in every sense of the word.*Theres nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So\ndrop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If youre looking for a writer\nfor your movie website or other publication, Id also love to hear from you.*",

For example, the showdown against Lokis army is\nbasically Transformers 3 final battle with different characters, and a less talented direction.The only real surprises\ncome from humor: I have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny. Apart from this, youll find nothing but\ncheesy costumes, woody and/or pointless dialogues, tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go\nnowhere (Black Widow, with all that chatting aimlessly about her past, is particularly confusing).And Thors hammer is\nblatantly fake.",

The type of the characters are clearly distinguishable, and is the same as in\nthe previous movies. But even if you didnt saw them, you can fully enjoy it, but if you did, it adds something extra.\nIts full of action, and even when it is not so much going on the screen you never feel like that something is missing\nor boring.

The hulk in this movie unlike its previous incarnation is modelled\non a gorilla, yes king kong! I didnt like that at all, its look, movement and facial expressions. I wanted to see a\npowerful superhuman not a monkey in a circus \"youll know what i mean\" lol.The reason I gave my review an extra star is\nbecause there were moments where i laughed. It is funny. But this doesnt make up for the weak clichd story and forced\nboring dialogue cut scenes between action sequences.The other star goes to the setting and set designs, which were\nappreciated.The acting was good but the films action reminded me of a WWE Royal Rumble match. Cant wait for the DARK\nKNIGHT RISES! It may raise my IQ.thanks",

    "reviewBody": "The movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the Earth will\nsoon face. A little too much time is spent with the peripheral characters; black widow, Hawkman and Fury but from the\nmoment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with Loki, the film picks up pace. What follows is\nentertaining but I think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of\ndelivering expectations. For example a fight match-up that was meant for the big-screen including two of the most\npowerful of the entourage left me asking for more. All is forgiven though as the action gets better and better\nthroughout and by then end when you think youve seen the finale it just keeps going. The last 30 minutes of the film is\nthe best of any superhero flick to date though I do wonder if the budget for CGI could have been spread across the\nearlier parts of the film less thinly. The humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material\nnot seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes. One of\nthe heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesnt get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show\noff like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the\nfact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass.",

All the performances are spot-on, and the photography and cgi beautiful. This is very much a movie for the fans,\nbut anyone can enjoy it.

The only missed opportunity I felt was for Captain\nAmerica... still too much of the poster boy soldier, and not enough of the Captain, except when he is dealing with\nshield agents, or policemen... and I still wanted the Captain to move more like Bronski did in the Hulk. Thor is\ndefinitely a God in this, and the Hulk is definitely a poorly guided atomic bomb. Iron Man and Banners intelligence was\na blast to watch, and the swagger of Stark is nicely offset by moments of fear for the limitations of his tech.

    "reviewTitle": "Very good, but not the greatest.",
    "reviewBody": "Hey guys. Ive written a HUGE review of this. Here is the first few paragraphs. Head over to www.thecrat.com to read my\nfull review.Disclaimer: if youre anything like me, you want to go into The Avengers as blind as possible. I will try to\navoid addressing the majority of the plot, but when I have to clearly address plot points I will mark them as\nspoilers.2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever. With new entries into some of the most beloved\nfranchises of all time (Lord of the Rings, Alien, James Bond and Batman) it is a good year to be a film geek. The first\nof the years massive releases arrives in the form of The Avengers (sorry, Hunger Games, you have the box office, but\nnot the scope to join the heavy hitters). The question everyone (or just geeks) is asking: is this the best comic book\nfilm ever? I would have to answer with an emphatic no. This film is big, huge in fact, and it gets a lot of things\nright. But I also think, considering the pedigree and lead-up to this film, The Avengers should have been a\ngame-changer. Unfortunately, it is not.The Avengers is the culmination of the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe.\nMarvel has created a series of films starring their heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and The Incredible Hulk)\nthat all coincide in the same reality (just like the comic books). This connectivity has been planned from the start so\nthat when Marvel was ready, they could join these characters into a single film. That moment has arrived with The\nAvengers. The Avengers is primarily made for fans of these films: if you have skipped the previous films and missed the\nback-story, you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limited.The plot of The Avengers sees the demigod Loki\n(the great, snarling Tom Hiddleston) planning to enslave the entirety of the human race. Minor spoilers: after his exile\nin Thor, Loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe, one controlled by an alien race known as the Chitauri\n(the identity of this race is inconsequential, and it is revealed within the first few moments of The Avengers). Loki\nplans to use the Chitauris numbers to achieve his goal of world domination. Once Loki makes his presence known on\nearth, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to unite earths mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating\nLoki and the Chitauri.The man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is Joss Whedon.\nWhedon acts as the writer and director of The Avengers and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet. Mainly known\nfor his television work (Buffy and Firefly), Whedon has only ever directed one other film: the low-scale (compared to\nThe Avengers) Serenity. Marvel Studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested (in big budget films) actors and\ndirectors to make their films (the recovering addict Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, the relatively unknown Chris\nHemsworth as Thor) and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously. Unfortunately, Whedon isnt exactly one\nof them. Despite being an authority on geek culture, Whedons pacing, plot and cinematic eye are good, but they still\nleave a lot to be desired. This is a quantum leap in terms of his career and Whedon (mostly) steps up to the plate. The\nAvengers would be a daunting prospect for any director, let alone one with a single film under their belt. Whedon is\nlargely regarded for his writing and in The Avengers it is very much hit and miss. He nails the characters voices and\nhis dialogue is mostly fantastic (except for a few Downey Jnr quips \" but knowing him, Id imagine they are\nimprovised).However, his basic plot framework is quite muddled. A film of this calibre should function like a well-oiled\nmachine, not feel like it is made out of spare parts. To read the rest head to www.thecrat.com",

    "reviewTitle": "Take note....fan boys CAN make decent films",
    "reviewBody": "Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the\nthrottle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. For those of you who dont know who this man is, hes been\naround a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films\nlike Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows\nlike Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to\ndirecting big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedons first big feature\nfilm, its also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.The Avengers is a long time\ncoming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding\nit (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful\nfilm franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and\nnarratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers\nInitiative.In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thors brother Loki who has used his power\nof illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create\na strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not\nonly develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.The story is over the top, but not enough that you find\nyourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds,\naliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedons\nscript is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier\nturns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, \"Lets dance\" as reflectors cover the ships surface much like\na mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the\nassembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield.\nLater Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes\nand superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for\nattention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage \" a lot of damage!It is not\nuntil part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity\nfrom total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.The script is what makes this film and is proof that\nstudios should trust \"fan boys\" with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write\na story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of\nreferences to the \"prequels\" and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter\negg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show\n(spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his \"I am a God\" speech, but each character gets a few choice\nlines that will surely become part of our vernacular. At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\nconsidering the scale and grandeur of the films final act \" the near destruction of New York. Although there are\nhallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together\nhuge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only\nmakes sense, but doesnt get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.The production flawlessly merges CGI and live\naction together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am\nsurprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didnt pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.I have long appreciated\nWhedons film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships\nexploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning\nthrough the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many\nfans will appreciate, but most will miss.The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and\nthat screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.This is the BEST comic\nbook \" SUPERHERO \" film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers- Best movie of the year so far. Fans salivate, non fans- prepare to get converted!",
    "reviewBody": "The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those\nlearned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an\nensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect\nsuperhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over\n6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful\nback story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a\ncertain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding\nback something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back\nfor the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien\ninvasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a\ncube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien\nfriends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing\nfor just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be \"hilariously out gunned\" and there will be the need for the\nindividual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something\nto the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings\nemotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before\nthey can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic\ntensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the films uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the\nsuperheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in\nlast years Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the\ncapabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movies biggest strength is\nits star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- \"billionaire, playboy, genius,\nphilanthropist\"- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an \"oh so serious\" group. Chris Evans as Captain\nAmerica might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris\nHemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye\nand Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as\nBruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddlestons Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward\nNorton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me,\nwith or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk\ndelivers the coup de grace to Loki. Lokis expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the\nmovie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in\nSpiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the\nheroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he\neven manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the\nbiggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit\nof the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon\nis a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss\nWhedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- \"hold\non\", he seems to say, \"the solution is just round the corner\"- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously,\nunlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his\nplace, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy\nthroughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party\ngoing strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully\ndressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all\ncounts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these\n146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the\nnon fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging,\nwith loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking\nout has never been so much fun.",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing, and I will break down why",
    "reviewBody": "When the Tesseract suddenly activates itself, it briefly opens a portal. A small one, but nonetheless it allows Loki(who\nuses his illusions well) to pass through... and he now has a sceptre that allows him to take over people by touch. He\nescapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy, and with the threat of it being used to allow an\ninvasion of Earth by the alien force the Chitari, what can Fury do other than... Assemble Avengers. This is an excellent\npiece, that lives up to the hype. It will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike. A lot\nof people will be exclaiming that, so I will try to back it up instead of just fawning over this(and believe me, I could\ngo 1000 words just doing that). It follows up on all... no, *all*... of the threads set up in the five films that came\nbefore(and yes, it will really help to have watched all of them before this... then again, if you have any interest in\nthis, you probably already have). Nothing is abandoned or ignored. The sheer planning that went into this... and this is\nstill full of fantastic surprises. And for all the development(all of that in this is highly credible, by the way) of\ncharacters, powers and conflicts(and this takes the ball and runs with it, and adds the interpersonal relationships of\nthese people who have not shared a screen before now, who are rather different people) that precedes this, there is a\nsolid amount of it in this, as well. All six(and no, you cant tell that two of them, one of them especially, havent\ngotten much screen time before this) members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introduction(actually, that\ngoes for Nick and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, both very cool, as well), a strong heroic act that only they could have\naccomplished, *and*... a situation of immense peril(not to mention that they(and we) are treated to one continuous\ntracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent, one by one, once theyve grown into a team,\nworking together... no, they dont start out like that, and yes, there is indeed infighting early on, and yes, we get\nevery one-on-one that anyone wants, and it is glorious... the trailer is literally just the preview). All of them have\nsomething to do(and they are recruited gradually, no one overshadowing anyone else... and somehow, this gets all the\naspects that make them work individually, in their own movies, somehow, without getting tonal schizophrenia), some\nreason to be in this, and the threat(Hiddleston is friggin intimidating) is grand enough that we need all of them, and\nfor them to band together. Tony has to prove that he is selfless, that he doesnt just fix his own mistakes(and he\nbrings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks, that come out to putting a severe dent in\nthe enemies). Steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him, and bring them all into one, effective\nunit(and he is the great leader that is required, one that you yourself would follow, and, indeed, a Super Soldier(a\ntitle he earns)). Thor(who brings godlike might, and a Shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy) and Natasha(who\nis the real brains of the operation, and can manipulate the foe... they use one of her qualities well, that being her\napparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not) are dealing\nwith a lot of guilt, on account of it being an Asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her... dark past as a spy\nwhod take on missions for or against anyone, respectively. Clint(who brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy\nto good use) has his own to make amends for(youll see...). Bruce(who comes with the sheer destructive weight of his\nalter ego) is brought on for his expertise on the subject of Gamma radiation(he can help find the vital cube), and... I\ndont need to spell out what he feels bad about, do I? He does seem to have gotten the Hulk under control... or has he?\nThis builds up the transformation, and he remains a danger. Hes the only one to have another person attached to it than\nplayed it last, and while I had no problem with Norton(who I love in other stuff... in that, he didnt do all he could\nwith it, though), this part is Ruffalos. There is this very terrifying aspect to him, he could metamorphose and cause\nsignificant damage and pain... and he plays it like youd expect him to be, very non-confrontational and anxious, yet\nsmart and confident in his field. All of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind, saving countless\npeople. There are not many supporting roles(Phil Coulson does return, and he is enjoyable, with a fandom of Cap; theres\nalso a female agent named Hill, who kicks ass... in fact, every woman in this is hot, independent and not objectified...\nkudos for that, along with the rest, Whedon), with focus placed where it should be, on the ensemble cast. Is it\nnecessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spot-on? Youve already seen Chris, Robert and Liam\ndo incredible, and they do so here, too. Everyone does. The writing is phenomenal. I am struggling to find one line of\ndialog(with Iron Man-like wit and banter) that isnt quotable, sharp and well-delivered. The action is plentiful, has\ndistinct stages to it(none of that unaimed, mindless crap), culminating in a truly massive climax, and somehow never\nrunning out of steam or exhausting the audience. This keeps to a pitch perfect pace, and at nearly two and a half hours,\nthere is nothing tedious or rushed. The FX? Breathtaking. 3D? Used right(only little distinctly moves towards/points at\nyou). I recommend this to everyone who is considering it. 10/10",

I thought I got my\nmoneys worth and then some!!The main protagonists all deliver top-notch performances....and the flick is filled with\ngreat comic moments....For me, the stand-out performance in the movie was delivered by the Hulk!....The special effects\n 3D were spot-on and the full repertoire of the Hulks destructive power were encapsulated in some great action\nsequences (the battle with Thor, throwing Loki around like a rag-doll and the one-punch of the alien being notable\nhighlights of the film)..My only criticism would be of the one-dimensional aliens....I think weve already seen enough\ngiant bugs in plenty a movie!!It is not on a par with a Chris Nolan Batman movie, nor, was it as intelligently crafted\nas the Watchmen Movie....Also, the storyline was fairly predictable from the off-set...The only recent comic ensemble\nthat can challenge this movie (imo) was the latest X-Men prequel....Well Done Joss Whedon, and the rest of the Avengers\nteam, I hope he can improve on this initial Avengers movie with an even better sequel.... In a nutshell...the Avengers\nAssemble delivers crash, bang and wallop in huge extremely satisfying doses!!",

    "reviewTitle": "An honest confession !!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "So much to say yet so little space .I feel like I am short of words today. But after watching this flick in IMAX reald\n3d I figure all of you would be as speechless as I am. Where do I begin Where do I end? The moral dilemma I am in to\nwrite this review.But Joss Whedon was one guy who knew exactly where to start and where to end in this Marvel fantasy\nepic. Yes the marvel cinematic universe was already in place. All the characters had been pre-established and had their\nown individual fan following. So how do you get a bunch of franchises all into one? Just do what Mark Millar did in the\nUltimates Vol.1.So you have a ready-made script which you need to modify very little of. Minor adjustments to make the\nHulk look like a good guy etc. and presto you have a script. Casting was never a problem anyway. Since Merril Lynch\ngave you 300 million USD to make this visual effects extravaganza the CGI was hardly ever going to be a problem with\nIndustrial Lights and Magic on your side. But where Whedon succeeds is the characterization. Every one from Chris\nEvans(Captain America) to Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) have their own screen time to develop their characters and\nstory. Marvel has done this before in X-men etc. but this movie just outdoes everything they ever made. The brilliance\nof Mr.Whedon is clearly seen here. I guess all those years of working in Buffyverse finally paid off! I initially\nthought it would be a Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) ride all the way. I even wore my Iron Man T-shirt as well.\nThankfully it was not so everybody pitches in equally and its fun to watch.The plot line is pretty simple and straight\nforward. A bunch of aliens try to attack earth with Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) leading the way. Nick Fury (Samuel L.\nJackson) tries to bring in The Avengers to bash the alien scum out of Earth. We all know how it turns out but its fun\nto watch it the way it happens, the way joss makes it happen. Yes the final battle sequence feels a little Star Warsy\nand Transformersy with the alien airspeeders flying all over the place and huge gigantic slug like creatures falling\nout of the sky but its still amazing to watch and is a visceral treat. I just cant wait for Avengers 2 to come out.Hope\nthey do the Civil War storyline (also by Mark Millar the genius that he is...). Wondering where the confession part is\nin all of this.. well here it is .I enjoyed it like a guilty pleasure. For me it was revenge. Revenge on everyone who\ncalls us avid comic book followers geeks or junkies! It was a slap in the face to all the cocky bastards who criticized\nme ever since I was in sixth grade until now for reading comic books calling them kids stuff. Those same guys would be\ninside the movie screens this week watching the Avengers I am sure. If they are not well the theyre even dumber than\nI thought. This movie brought back my memories of being a kid with bronchitis sitting on his bed dosed up with meds with\nnothing but a Captain America and Iron Man issue to keep him company. Of course I had the Justice League and\nBatman but since this is a marvel movie I will leave out the DC guys till TDKR comes out.I am no Captain America but\nI am a patriot. Yeah the movie released in India a week earlier before the U.S which was uber cool. Also Bruce Banner is\non the run and hiding in Calcutta so yes he speaks Hindi. Also the end credits track is played by Soundgarden (Chris\nCornell) who happen to be one of my most favorite band of all time (Yeah my first love is comic books second is guitar\nbased hard rock...go figure!!!!).Their lead guitarist is a guy of Indian origin. He is called Kim Thayil and he rocks\nhard.So to sum it all up whether your young or old assemble your fellow avengers go to your nearest movie screen and\nshout it out loud \" Avengers Assemble!\" and make Marvel all the money they deserve for giving us a fantastic movie\nexperience.",

    "reviewBody": "The very beginning of the movie is capable enough to build your interest and keeps you watching. The movies has many\nrelative terms from other movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and people who havent seen \"Captain America:The First\nAvenger\" or \"Thor\"or \"The Incredible Hulk\"or \"Ironman\" might have to scratch their heads at times...but that will not\nmatter a lot because the movie will keep you laughing and will keep you in the moment, never letting you get bored. The\nmovie is intense at many times, thrilling a sometimes too..but the action and comedy is amazing. Especially the scene\nwhere Loki is beaten up by Hulk like a washer-mans clothes will keep you laughing even after Hulk is finished up with\nhis beating. Every time you start thinking that you are getting bored, and start sliding on your seat, something will\nhappen in the movie and you will straighten up on your seat, waiting for more. The movie will keep on building a plot\nfor action throughout its length and will blast your head with thrilling action scenes in the end. The performance by\nevery actor is respectable. The dignity of each character is maintained. None of the superheroes is portrayed miser than\nothers. Even Hawkeye and Black Widow gain audiences respect in the end. In short, the movie is a must watch and for the\nfans of any of The Avengers or the superheroes who are a part of it will commit a sin if they do not watch this movie.",

    "reviewBody": "since everyone has talked about the good pts. quite lengthily already, let me share my thoughts on why it still fell\nshort of my expectations:didnt get what loki was up to with the whole alien invasion plan; i mean, whats his end-game\nassuming they win, when it seems the aliens are in it for themselvesspeaking of the aliens.. theyre just too inept and\nposed almost no threat at all, other than the sheer size of their army. even black widow thrashed a number of them, when\ni was expecting the skill level and strength of these invaders would at least be \"capt America\" level; capt America..\nnow theres a character who was just embarrassingly poorly used. i felt like he was being bossed around by everyone,\nwhen in the comics, he is the true leader. the scene, where all of sudden, he was giving orders to everyone, was just\ntrite. i mean, where was this even coming from? never showed any true leadership qualities for a good 2 hrs of the\nmovie, and now hes calling the shots? couldve been better developedand the team, after fighting and arguing the whole\ntime, i just didnt see a good enough plot device for them to get their act together, for the big alien battle. it was\njust too abrupt for me, w/o any clear progression from individual issues to being integral members of a team. and the\ndeath of the agent as a trigger? cmon! thats just lame. there was no emotional investment for anyone on the team to\ndecide on what happened next. other than widow and hawkeye, who barely worked with the guy, the rest just didnt have\nanything much to do with guy, even ironman, for that matter. i think what im driving at is the transition, how these\nsuperheroes should have evolved from individuals to being members of the team, begged for improvement.minor gripe:\nthough ruffalo did pretty well, i think the part wasnt as well written. hulk/banner character was just confusing. he\nattacks widow  thor, and next thing you know, he develops compassion, camaraderie, and heroic tendencies. plus, this\nbanner is completely diff from the norton banner in terms of how he was written. cant imagine norton referring to\n\"hulk\" simply as the \"other guy\", and in that manner; was just so out of character for me.dont get me wrong, i did\nenjoy the movie. great action scenes. just wasnt too thrilled with the plot and story. they could have taken a page\nfrom the animated movie, \"ultimate avengers\". now, that was tight story that the live avengers movie could have been,\neven w/o giant man  wasp.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers: An Assembly of Sheer Awesomeness!!!",
    "reviewBody": "From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of Iron Man four years ago, talking about the\nAvengers Initiative, the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvels greatest icons! Well,\nfour years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer\nawesomeness!Unlike the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films, The Avengers isnt really into complex plotting\nhere. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian God, seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and\nNick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the Avengers Initiative, bringing together armored hero Iron Man\n(Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Lokis brother and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris\nHelmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce\nBanner and his monstrous alter ego the Hulk (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of\nEdward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is\nthe usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, Spiderman. Indeed,\none of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each\nof the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film\nitself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, The Avengers real strength lies in\nthe characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was\nto be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel\nmovie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the\nrampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately\nevident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is\na man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to\nshine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency,\nfor months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a competition between The\nAvengers and Nolans upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such\ncomparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star\nWars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and\n(literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on\ntheir own merits!",

    "reviewTitle": "Best. Comic Book Movie. EVER.",
    "reviewBody": "This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. Its the pinnacle, the\nultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action,\ntension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype \" years and years worth of hype \"\nmight cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS\nMOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team\nmade up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth),\nHawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy\nfew, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies\nIRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the\nscientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight\nagainst an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson)\nand under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, its awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, its by\nno means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of\nportent which is given to some truly innocuous lines \" especially the final line \" feels a little off-kilter. Flashing\nup a computer image of Natalie Portmans Jane (Thors love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and\nthe shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette\nSmoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly clich.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a\ndoubt incredible.Just for fun, lets talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey\nJr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award\nfor Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it\nhe surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is\nhappily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given\nsomewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renners relaxed performance once again worthy of my\nbeloved marksmans bow and arrow. Clark Greggs mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile\nour main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thors resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy\ncool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Arent you funny and great?Of the newcomers,\nI will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalos Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward\nNortons turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey,\nmild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of\nthis movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How\nI Met Your Mothers Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little \" enough to hope we see\nmore of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing\nlike this one, who wouldnt already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have\never seen (and Ive seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year \" whew! I was so\nhoping BATTLESHIP wouldnt continue to hold that title for too much longer \" and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers\nassemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again(And make sure you stay\nthrough the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they\ndont quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference)-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine -\nwww.geekspeakmagazine.com",

    "reviewBody": "Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo),\nThor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson),  Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well\nthey do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the\nS.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik\nSelvig(Stellan Skarsgard)  Hawkeye under his control  leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick\nFury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only\nrecently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she\nrecruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to\ncheck the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these\nevents took place in Captain America: The First Avenger)  woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years.\nAfter that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the\nteam can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues  cut down their giant egos  work together as a\nteam. Problematic? Yes! Iron Mans sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is\nhilarious! First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the\nsuperhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil \nmenacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The\ncinematography is brilliant. The way theyve shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A\nnote on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite\ncharacter in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce\nBanner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy\nRenner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though hes the only villain\nin the movie hes pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie\nSmulders as Maria Hill  Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit\nback  relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Dont miss this on the big screen no matter what\npeople! Now, lets see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one. The bar has been set very high\nthough!",

    "reviewTitle": "Finally, a Film that Lives Up to Its Hype and High Expectations!",
    "reviewBody": "The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of\nthe heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual\nfilms were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of\nthem in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some\nMarvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills its advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how\nthese heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called\nthe Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of\nthe heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along\nwith the high-intensity action. I felt though that some \"funny\" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for\ncomfort in a \"team\" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the\nlesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow\n(stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo\nmovies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic\nCaptain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo\ncould take Ed Nortons place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique\ncharm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal\nAgent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel\ncomics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon. Dont miss the\nextra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.",

    "reviewTitle": "Here it is, the masterpiece weve been waiting for. :)",
    "reviewBody": "I was eagerly waiting for this movie. But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and\nIncredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due\nto Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of\ncourse Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws.\nSufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the\nHulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, youll see more of Captain\nAmerica(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off\nwhoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick\nFury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals\nthe show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were\nperfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Dont\nexpect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the\nfilm in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two\nare COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better\nthan Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both\nat equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly.\nUnfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to\nleave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person\nwho is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I\nwill say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films\nin the film history. Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.",

    "reviewTitle": "Whedons explosive comic-com smashes the bullseye...",
    "reviewBody": "Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the\nflaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question:\nwhere exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedons Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through\nthe roof? Well, guess what? Hes only gone and pulled it off. Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the\nfirst Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of\nsomething (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers\nmovie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a films been coming since the\nearly 1960s. And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert\nDowney-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didnt fancy this one but fear not,\nHulk nuts, Ruffolos twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and youre\nguaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it\ngoes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet\nJohanson) to help save the world from Thors bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if\nyou thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing youve ever seen. Think again. Skilled sci-fi\npen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster thats more than the\nsum of its fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. Its incredible. Its thunderous.\nIts furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, lets get down to business.Whedon has approached this\nfour-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development\nand chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another its actually surprising. The\nsheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is\nsaying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation\nof comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.Downey-Juniors effortlessly cool turn on the sarci Stark was always going to\nbe the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. Its not all about the billionaire\nball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the\nout-of-touch Cap chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddlestons creepy demigod makes for a sharp\nvillain.Granted, Whedons tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to\nmeasure up to any of Nolans Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why theres\nnot much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolans Dark Knight rebirth. Its a\nkick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating\naffair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. Its an absolute blast. Wildly\nentertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud,\nexciting, electric and did I mention funny!? Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no.\nX-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot.\nWhedons Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most\nentertaining. Definitely the coolest.Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the\ncrap out of one and all. But you wont mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesnt get much better than this. Joss Whedon and\nco. have kicked this years comic-book-busters off with a bang. Expect sequels.",

    "reviewTitle": "It was worth the wait!",
    "reviewBody": "Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted\nout to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk,\nIron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and\ncritically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks\nmoving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have\nheadlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so Im ignoring Abbott and Castellos role in bringing\ntogether Dracula, Frankensteins Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with\nbringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have\ncarried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be\nnothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully\njudged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble\npieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always\ngoing to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I wont say anything very much about the content, because there is so\nmuch in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the\naverage viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been\nestablished in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they havent been changed for The\nAvengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action\nis stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for\nsaddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\" (which communicates even less to a\nnon-comics audience than \"The Avengers\") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title\nscreen.",

    "reviewBody": "Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they\nannounced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word \" Superb. I dont mind watching it once\nagain. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who\nwas dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his\narmy can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Lokis slave. In order to\nprotect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America ,\nThor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people\nof earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to\nmake a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this\ncomic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of\ncourse, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the\ncharacters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers\nsteam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight\nbetween Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective\nalong with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On\nthe flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless,\nit is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his\nportrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo\nas Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of\nexpression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb\nCGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well. Excellent 4/5",

    "reviewBody": "I dont care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those\npeople obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasnt\ndisappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I\nsee The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of\nthem is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences.\nI am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were\ncertainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this\nfilm that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasnt a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes\nare good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our\nvillain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer\nthan 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesnt drag and\ndoesnt make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest\nare awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasnt bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment.",

    "reviewTitle": "Gloriously entertaining, and extremely well-balanced across its large cast of characters",
    "reviewBody": "Avengers (all right, \"Avengers Assemble\" if you insist) is really quite extraordinarily good. Its pretty much\neverything thats fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen - I was hoping for as much from Joss\nWhedon and he delivered.Like Serenity and the Buffy season 5 finale, its extremely well-structured so that everyone\ngets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes; I cant think of another action movie that has so\nmany characters and is so well-balanced between them all, and all the different combinations of arguments and team-ups\nbetween them.Its also extremely funny (but *mostly* not in that trademark Joss Whedon \"Buffyspeak\" way that some VERY\nWRONG people find \"precious\" and annoying). It has better Tony Stark dialogue than either Iron Man movie! Having said\nthat, the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the Hulk...I often complain that superhero films weakest parts\ntend to be their climactic action sequences: the stakes are raised, and believability is strained. Well, for once we\nhave a superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end. Its one of the best-sustained action finales since The\nMatrix - and much better-directed than the incomprehensible shots of The Dark Knight. Its constantly spectacular and\ncontains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue - most of which also happen to be very funny.But the\nbest *single scene* in the whole film isnt an action scene! A standard phrase Joss Whedon has used in promotional\ninterviews is \"I wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other\".\nWell, that scene where they *are* all in the same room as each other turned out to be the films absolute highlight.\nScenes like that are what Ill look forward to on subsequent viewings. There have been lots of action films that Ive\nenjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re-watch because that they didnt\nhave much else going for them (Avatar comes to mind) - but this isnt one of them.The films plot isnt exactly\nintricate: its extremely tightly focused around the MacGuffin from Thor and Captain America. However, this isnt a bad\nthing: in a film of this scale, ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as\nit is, without adding a complex twisty-turny plot to the mix as well.The film doesnt carry any sort of larger\nreal-world message; its really just a movie about these specific characters - about guys in silly costumes beating the\nliving daylights out of each other. But as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out\nof each other go... well, its hard to imagine how they could get much better.",

Nick Fury convinces them all to join the Avengers Initiative ,which later leads to confusion\nbrawl and Fights on the insideAll is taken lightly until the realization and attack on the Base which proves that the\nwhole world is at stake. The Screenplay as well as the Storyline is Amazing, every scene handled with perfection. The\nStory is well explained and gives a break from the Action which keeps you In the Movie. The Cinematography is Awesome\nand Exceptional with the Direction and Special Effects Justifies the Storyboard and is Realistic...All the Action\nSequences are well Coordinated, Engaging and with popping 3D effects well in place its a treat to the eye. The Screen\nSpace is shared equally and handled well between the Large Cast... About the Soundtrack its Average, nothing\nExtraordinary or Provoking. The movie just misses out somewhere on the Emotions. The Previous releases have already made\nthe Superheroes Familiar and this avoids much confusion. Well Edited and Brilliantly Adapted screenplay makes the most\nof the Storyline and even handles the major challenge that could have been faced of making Order of Chaos. The much\nHyped movie has definitely met the expectations and is perfect blockbuster. Even watch it from some fresh Action from\nHulk, Black Widow, and The Hawkeye who dont disappoint you at all. Mark Raffalos performance and Character is\nnoticeable out of all the other Star Superheroes. No doubt the best superhero movie this Decade. 3 time watch for Comic\nSuperhero Movie fans. 2 time for Super Action Fans. And at least a onetime must watch for every other Hollywood Movie\nBuff out there.",

    "reviewTitle": "Joss Whedon Has Done It Right And Well",
    "reviewBody": "With the success of Jon Favreaus Iron Man in 2008, calls started ringing out across the comic book universe for not\nonly further comic book movies, but also for the The Holy Grail of Cinematic Superheroes, which is also known as an\nAvengers film. What followed was four more Marvel Universe movies, the introduction of many favoured and established\ncharacters and the continual teasing of fans across the globe with post-credit sequences. The introduction of Samuel L.\nJackson as Commander Nick Fury inevitably announced to fans that an Avengers movie would come to fruition and it\nbrought forth the key question of when rather than where, who and why.The man tasked with throwing all these vibrant\ncharacters into a smouldering cauldron of excitement and pure unadulterated geekiness is one Joss Whedon. Hes already\ncreated three incredibly successful television shows and an incredibly successful tie-in movie in Serenity, but this\nis undoubtedly his biggest challenge to date. Today sees the release of The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble in the\nUnited Kingdom) across the globe, and while it contains evident flaws, its nothing short of a two hour canonical ride\nacross the Marvel Universe which provides everything to satisfy fans, nerds and casual cinema-goers alike.Buried deep\nbeneath a Government facility is the mystical cube known as the tesseract. When it begins to mysteriously start\noperating by itself Commander Nick Fury, and his agents Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders),\nunexpectedly come face-to-face with the Asgard deity Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The God is being seemingly controlled by a\nhigher being, with but one simple, yet distinct aim, to control, enslave and destroy the Earth and humanity. With\nreluctance, Fury initiates the Avengers protocol, which brings together the rag-tag team of superheroes consisting of:\nIron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the Asgard God Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America Steve Rogers (Chris\nEvans), Clint Hawkeye Barton (Jeremy Renner), the Black Widow Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and the\nunpredictable Dr Banner (Mark Ruffalo).Where The Avengers had the ability to fall pretty darn hard was with the amount\nof material ready at hand. Joss Whedon couldve potentially created a ten-hour-three-film epic without even scratching\nthe surface of what drives these beings to do what they do. Instead, in the running time which extends to just over two\nhours, hes created an intimate and humanised portrayal of six individuals who may be Gods, geniuses, super-human beings\nand destructive radioactive experiments on the outside, but all reflect deep, inner trauma on the inside.The initial\nmeetings between the characters show an element of distrust and reluctance. Why should one be subordinate to others\nwhen, by all accounts in their own minds, they all have the better technology, powers or intellect? With their flaws\nprominently on show from the beginning Whedon doesnt just show the audience superheroes, but he creates them before\nyour own eyes. Building these characters from the inside, outside he allows the audience to empathise with their\nplights. After all, Thor is simply an Asgardian God with family issues, Dr Banner simply wants to be left alone in\nisolation to his own devices, and Black Widow and Hawkeye seem to battling those basic primal urges that come with\nhumanity and prolonged friendship.But one character that does continually feel out of place is the antagonist of the\npiece, Loki. Despite Tom Hiddleston creating a superb maniacal villain with thespian traits who thrives on power and\ndestruction, its hard to shake-off the fact that Loki he is constantly being undermined by those pulling his\npuppeteering strings. Yet, this should not detract away from his performance which constantly steals the show whenever\nhe is on-screen with other members of the Avengers initiative, and which can be partly attributed to Josh Whedon and Zak\nPenns slick screenplay.The script contains some suspect writing in places, especially with regards to Dr Banner and\nsome of the more unusually up-beat and intellectually void phrases he spouts. But aside from the odd sentence here or\nthere, Whedon and Penns script manages to combine the right mix or humour, bravado and arrogance allowing, not only\neach characters personality to thrive, but also the plot to be continually be driven forward. Whether its the\nblossoming relationship between two prominent superheroes or the developing nature of the narrative, the film is never\nstagnant, and its this plot development which gives Joss Whedon the ability to let his comic book geekdom roam free in\nthe final act with an enthralling visual action-orientated conclusion.Starting in Manhattan, the action takes place on\nthe ground, in the air, inside buildings and generally anywhere where theres an enough room to photograph a glorious\nall battle of good versus evil. Explosions saturate the air, but theres also an enjoyable emphasis on hand-to-hand\ncombat, especially when the likes of Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America are left without their weapons.\nBeautifully choreographed, fast, frenetic and aesthetically pleasing the final thirty minutes are a fitting and welcome\nconclusion to an epic comic book movie. Joss Whedon hasnt only managed to finally bring the six glorious superheroes to\nthe big-screen. But hes also also managed to do it well, very well.",

    "reviewTitle": "Totally Awevengersome",
    "reviewBody": "Just came back from watching The Avengers. Awesome , epic, cool, outstanding, fantastic etc. Looks like for almost the\nwhole year of me waiting to watch movie and all the hype that they built up was worth the waitTom Hiddleston as Loki is\nas evil as ever but it would have been great if more villains had shown up along the way. Jeremy Renner as Clint\nBarton/Hawkeye was the surprising character for me since I never expected him to turn evil but he was definitely the\nright man chosen for the role. Scarlett Johansson was beautifully stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Thor was\ngreat and surprisingly gave The Hulk a run for his money (something which I didnt quite expect to see). Speaking of\nHulk, Mark Ruffalo was well suited to play Bruce Banner/Hulk (although Norton was better in my opinion). Cobie Smulders\nas Maria Hills was a bit of a let down since I expected more screen time for her. Samuel L. Jackson was OK as Nick Fury.\nRobert Downey Jr. is as goofy as ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man but for me the biggest driving force of the entire movie\nhas got to none other than Chris Evans awesome acting as Steve Rogers/Captain America. He was in my opinion the biggest\nstar of the film in my opinion and really made the team come together as one. The plot was very simple and\nstraightforward but the action scenes and dram was what made the movie really interesting. Who says that the movie needs\nto have a good storyline in order for the film to be great. The movie itself doesnt necessary require story background\nfor the characters at all since they were all already told in their own separate movies respectivelyOn a note to those\nwho have been complaining on the film for being mindless boring etc. My question is, what did you expect from a\nsuperhero movie? This movie is all about action and it was made to be entertaining and fun to watch, not for you to sit\nand expect a twisty kind of turn story like TDK. The main reason why people go watch is because they wanted to see their\nfavorite main heroes from different franchise team up together in the same movie. Thats all that is and to me, that\nisnt a bad thing at allI have a degree in film and video (majoring animation if youre wondering) but I still find this\nmovie really good. If you guys are looking for something else beyond action in this film, then you guys are in the wrong\nplace All in all, an epic film which definitely deserves to be ranked in the IMDb top 100 movie list and definitely\nabove TDK. This is one movie which I will surely go and see againOn A Final Note :- KUDOS TO JOSS WHEDON AND THE ENTIRE\nCREW FOR MAKING AN AWESOME SUPERHERO FILM. CANT WAIT FOR THE AVENGERS 2",

It might seen a little \"over-powered\" but the feeling you get, watching all\nof these personalities fight together, makes it work.

    "reviewTitle": "An amazing star-cast, well-paced direction and a brilliant story !!!",
    "reviewBody": "\"Amazing\", would be a one word review for this movie!I went on to the cinema yesterday and was excited enough to have\nwatched the trailers more than 30 to 40 times and was thinking, how would Marvel / Joss Whedon contain any of these\ncharacters in such a short story (last for about 142 min) when each of them were brilliant enough to grip me in 130-150\nminutes of their own (in Iron Man 1  2, Thor, Captain America). But Mr. Whedon knew what he wanted from the story and\nhas clearly demarcated his territory.This has to be the best superhero movie till date. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man /\nStark) has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is, well, strong and\nmanly, Chris Evans (Captain America) has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between\nall the action and a surprise, Hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too, for a delightful change. I really think\nMark Ruffalo (The Hulk) is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and\nexcitement to this amazing roller coaster of a movie.I delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 (I hope there was a 11\npossible) for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster, without a break!!!Watch it, if you want to know\nhow Superhero movies should be!",

    "reviewBody": "I went into this movie with very high expectations cause I watched all the trailers about 30 times each. I will say from\nthe very first 10 minutes of the films I was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story. All the\ncharacters in this film get an equal amount of screen time, which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with\nmultiple characters such as in this film. I applaud Joss Whedon for making this Marvel Masterpiece, the way everything\nfits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story. Mr Whedon was\nthe perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as hes a comic book fan, he nailed it 100%. I believe im\ngoing to see this film again tomorrow, it is just that awesome. Hulk will give you a fun time in this film, watch out!",

    "reviewTitle": "Well Worth the Wait!",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers or Marvels Avengers Assemble here in the UK for ridiculous reasons is the long awaited teaming up of the\ncharacters from Marvels recent and successful movies. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and steals The Tesseract,\nan energy source being worked on by scientists at S.H.I.E.L.D. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury (Samuel L\nJackson) activates the Avengers Initiative and assembles a team of superhuman men and women that comprises of Captain\nAmerica (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Lokis brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth)\nwho join S.H.I.E.L.D Agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in attempting to stop Loki from\nsubjugating the worlds population.There was always the danger that things could go tits up for Marvel when producing\na film on this scale and with so many well known characters and actors/personalities involved. Im delighted to say that\nthey have pulled it off and that The Avengers is a terrific film. The plot itself plays second fiddle to the assembling\nof the team and I dont think this was a bad thing. Obviously Marvel will be hoping for a sequel or five to come after\nthe film so it was essential that the characters interactions and developments with each other were given high priority.\nThe sharp dialogue is thrown between the characters with more force and precision than a throw of Thors hammer. In the\nend the story is similar to every other superhero movie; bad guy brings destructive forces to Earth in an attempt to\nrule and/or destroy humanity while superhero(s) attempt to stop them. In Loki and Tom Hiddleston though, there is a bad\nguy who carries great menace and feels more dangerous when he is doing nothing than when he is thrashing his weapon\naround. I think that Hiddleston gives the best performance of the piece.The time given to each character seemed fair and\nworked well. There was a risk that this could have turned into Iron Man 3 plus Other Guys and as youd expect given his\ncharacter traits, Downey Jr does get more dialogue than the others but not so much that he overpowers the film. Captain\nAmerica becomes the de-faco leader of The Avengers, Thor has a vested interest in bringing Loki to justice and while Id\nlike to have seen more of Dr. Banner, the Hulk had the best action scenes and also the biggest laugh of the entire film.\nScarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Sam Jackson also have plenty to do. It is testament to how good the film is that\nthere are no characters who feel forgotten or underused.Ive said in the past that I wish action blockbusters would be\nmore fun. They always seem so straight and serious (i.e. Battleship), but The Avengers is the most fun film Ive seen in\na long time. The action was frenetic and thankfully avoided too much shaky-cam so I was able to keep up with it. It is\nalso one of the funniest films Ive seen for a few weeks. Marvels films always have humour intrinsically wound into\nthem but never before has there been so much and that its hit the mark so often. I cant think of a big Hollywood movie\nthat has made me laugh this much so far in 2012.As well as being action packed and fun, the movie also looks incredible.\nI saw it in 2D (and wont go on a rant as to why, but basically Im sick of crummy, dark, 3D) and it still popped off the\nscreen. Highlights included the fantastic and believable technology used aboard S.H.I.E.L.Ds ship and most\nspectacularly of all, the giant Centipede like bad guys who looked phenomenal. The sight of them ripping through New\nYork City is something that will stay with me. The main characters design and costume were all excellent. Iron Man\nlooked even cooler when covered in dents and scratches and The Hulks design is far improved from his Edward Norton\ndays. For me the best costume though was Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow outfit because of.. um.. well.. the.. the\ncolours nice. Yes the colour.My only complaints are mild and that is that the horde of alien bad guys didnt really do\nmuch. It was only really numbers that they had on their side. Another small problem I had was trying to remember where\neveryone fitted as Ive only seen each of the lead-up films once so couldnt quite place some people, words and ideas.\nThose though are extremely pernickety and minor problems.Overall The Avengers is one of the most entertaining films Ive\nseen in years and at the end of the day we go to the cinema to be entertained so what more can I add? Only that this\nfilm has become greater than the sum of its parts.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

In their way stand\nsuperheroes \" each as formidable as the other, each dealing with his/her demons, and with each other. The way Joss\nWhedon handled the cast is impressive..none of the superhero felt left behind..and his direction is at top notch..\nComing to the cast Robert Downey Junior is impressive..he can be termed as \"The Jack Sparrow\" of the avengers with his\ncheeky lines.. Chris Evans,Chris Hemsworth,Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are impressive..but the biggest surprise\nis Mark Rufallo as the Dr.Bruce Banner a.k.a the Hulk(\"the other guy\")..he Delivers probably the best scenes in the\nmovie and oh boy he steals the show big time..!! never enjoyed anything on big screen as him(The Hulk)..coming to the\nothers Tom Hiddleston is good as a much formidable opponent to the group of superheroes, slimy and evil in equal\nmeasure.

The stunning action, the\nwitty dialog makes it irresistible.Avengers makes it fun to be a geek. If you like intelligent humor, thrilling story\nand larger than life action in your movie, then Avengers is for you. There were claps, cheers and shouts all around in\nthe cinema.

Movie starts off with a very slow pace and then it gathers speed since the entry of iron man.This\nmovie has a large number of academy awards nominees. Robert Downey Jr; Gwyneth Paltrow; Samuel L Jackson; Jeremy Renner;\nMark Ruffalo etc.It is Robert Downey Jrs movie indeed. He delivered a spectacular performance as a guy who cant help\nbut to tell wits in each and every sentence he says. Th audience loved watching Iron man in action. I was happy with\nentry of Gwyneth Paltrow as well.Mark Ruffalo managed to stick to his own personal standard as well. He portrays a man\nwho is very caring, soft and tender but later turns out to be someone who is disastrous to the environment, when he gets\nangry. Scarlett Johanssen shined well in this film. She was very flexible in action as well as acting. Her addition made\nthis movie much more thrilling. She look very cool with curled red hair. It is definitely one of her best looks since\nVicky Cristina Barcelona. Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth too was good.Chris Evans looked a lot different from his\nearlier films. He managed deliver the maturity his character Captain America needed.The whole film had a lot of visual\neffects. The 3d effects mad the movie look more attractive. one can definitely go for the film to look for their\nfavorite super hero. Definitely the fans of Iron man will love the film.8/10",

Really often we see top 1000 voters who presses a movie down - by giving bad\nvotes. Once in a while, some of the old movies are ready to get out of the top 250 list. They have to accept that. The\nproject to get the Avengers together, has been done in an excellent way - bravo. I was not sure, what to get - because\nso many heroes should work together. Would someone steal the limelight? And would it be 80% Iron Man, and 20% Avengers?\nNo, its is pure 100% Avengers. Thank you.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spoiler-Free review of an Awesome flick!",
    "reviewBody": "The movie touches on all bases that a good super-hero / fantasy movie should. A fantastic story line, solid action, good\nhumor, and amazing visuals.The story is a bit much, kinda out-there (literally) but it is in keeping with the nature of\nthe Thor / Asgard storyline. You cant include a Norse God without accepting some magik / fantasy elements. Plus the\nAvengers always tackled those issues in the books. Even the pacing was right on; at no point does it get slow or bogged\ndown in exposition. Bottom line: it works.The action is solid on all levels, and some of it is just breathtaking. Even\nthe face-offs are surprising, and fun to watch. Best action in a superhero movie period.The humor / emotion: the movie\nis hilarious without being stupid or directed at 8-year olds. Lucas / DC Comics take note! You dont have to make lame,\nchildish jokes to be funny. Think more Joker with the pencil than anything in Green Lantern. Downey Jr is the driving\nforce of this movie, and his Stark is turned up a notch. There a some literal laugh-out-loud moments in there, and some\nmoments where the theater became deathly still. They pull strings without making you feel like a puppet.Finally,\nvisually the movie looks amazing. ILM outdid themselves, and the one spot Im sure everyone was worried about, the green\none, just looks sick. Not a lot of shake-the-camera fake action, but some great scenes, even a few surprising choices of\nvantage points.The cast was perfect, Ruffalo IS Banner. A throwback to the Bixby days, instantly making you forget\nNorton or Bana. Evans owns the Cap / Leader / Good Guy role. You want to follow him. Johannson is a bad-ass in her role,\nHemsworth is good, although Thor is kinda one-note. Hawkeye is an intriguing character, and Renner has the same great\nsmirky tension he had in Hurt Locker. Agent Coulson has a much-expanded role in this, and his parts are special in\nthemselves. And of course, Downey is king.Im not a huge Avengers fan, never was. X-Men or The Justice League were always\nmy favorites, so Im not total fanboy, but I think this movie captured every element a true comic fan would want to see\non the screen, and casual fans can just enjoy it as well, because it stands alone as a great movie. Probably the best\nsince First Class, maybe the best since Dark Knight. I know I walked out feeling like I did after Return Of The King.\nIts that good!",

It had heart, comedy, action, animation, character development, suspense; all neatly\nencompassed in a smooth and flawlessly flowing Joss Whedon storyline.Each character has his/her moment of glory and not\none of the actors/actresses feel short of the high expectations placed upon their shoulders. Chris Evans as Captain\nAmerica is and always will be my favourite character in this Marvel film series and he shined brighter than ever in his\nsecond role reprisal.I cannot more highly insist you see this film whilst it is IN THE CINEMAS! In 3D if you possibly\ncan as it adds depth and en-chances the CGI (especially on the tanked body of The Hulk and the none CGI behind of Miss.\nScarlett).The Avengers Assembled in perfect form, lets bring on the next one!",

It doesnt matter if you\nhave seen earlier MARVEL movies or not, although if you have seen them it will provide great character depth. Each\ncharacter gets its own moments - both physically and emotionally, but quick witted on liners by Iron Man(Robert Downey\nJr.) and awesome action pieces by Hulk steals the show. Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has his moments to as major super villain.\nThe movie has humor, and all in the right places. The screenplay, dialogues and dialogue delivery is very good and\naction pieces are the kind that you have never scene before, especially in last half hour.This movie is EPIC.In short,\nit a movie that you should not miss and if you do you will regret it later.

    "reviewTitle": "So good!",
    "reviewBody": "I suppose the question on your lips is Any Good?The short answer is yes.The longer answer is F**k me silly, that\nfilm was awesome!The even longer answer is:Joss Whedon has created a witty, entertaining superhero that more than\ncapably juggles different characters and threads all together into an unsubtle, but solid film.It helps if youve seen\nthe previous Marvel Studio films in the franchise before seeing this. I had personally seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain\nAmerica and Thor although I had not seen The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton and I had a good idea of the principal\ncharacters and what was going on. There is the barest bones of back-story for each of the heroes but the majority of\nexposition is around the character of Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Bruce Banner/Hulk\n(Mark Ruffalo).Speaking of which, Mark Ruffalo somehow steals the show as the Hulk, utterly removing the previously\nuninspiring film adaptations. He is amazing, in every way. Bruce Banner gets some quality lines and Mark Ruffalo\ndelivers in pretty much every way, it is a lot more of a subtle performance than most of his fellow actors, who are much\nmore brazen, brash and forward.Robert Downey Jr once again delivers as Iron Man, a character that is as rich and as\ninteresting two films down the line as he ever was. He gets the best lines and even though it takes a little bit of time\nto introduce Iron Man compared to some of the other characters, he sticks in the mind and has his own standouts moments\nalongside the rest of the Avengers.Captain America (Chris Evans) is also on top form as Captain America, a character I\nwas initially concerned would not fit well into the dynamic of the group but his character fits really nicely.As a\npersonal favourite, it is always nice to see Loki on the screen. His little brother syndrome makes his a fascinating\nvillain in Thor and Tom Hiddleston absolutely proves he is brilliant as this twisted, powerful trickster. In Loki, once\nagain, Marvel Studios provide a villain that is as well fleshed out and as interesting as the heroes. Ive already\nmentioned Josh Whedons outlandish ability to fuse together so many characters into a film well. When all the Avengers\nhave assembled, each character and their traits clash in a....realistic way, the selfless with the arrogant etc etc.\nWhilst the film does try extremely hard to have as many Avenger on Avengers fights as possible and they are thrilling,\nseeing them work together as a team is frankly fantastic. Again, several stunning shots pan seamlessly from one\ncharacter to the next, cutting through the large amounts of chaotic action to deliver what you wanted to see,\nsuperheroes beating on things.Another key Whedon-ish (tm) is the humour. It is a pretty funny film too boot.Its $220\nmillion budget went a long way too. Apart from the actors and the not inconsiderable sums of money they would have been\npaid, the CGI is almost faultless. It is awesome, and always seems to make the events feel like a comic book. Again, the\nstandout being a very realistic, physical Hulk. The best incarnation yet, for sure. Its not without fault:The plot is\nnonsense. The script is sometimes clunky and awkward.It is a long film (although doesnt really feel like it)However,\nthese are mere grains of sand on a beach of AWESOMNESS.Watch this film!9/10 easy.",

    "reviewTitle": "In a classroom, \"The Avengers\" is definitely an \"A\" student but not necessarily the brightest or the most creative.",
    "reviewBody": "If you are a fan of any of the marvel characters in the movie, like myself, you will not be disappointed. You will\nexactly see what you have expected it to be in full length since the release of its trailer, no more, no less.Every\nsuperhero gets ample screen time and their interactions with one another is pleasantly entertaining.The surprise here is\nthe Hulk, whom I think is far more fun to watch here than in his own movies. Accolades to Ruffalo, who did a great job\nwith Banner. (Im not sure if he can be as good as Ed Norton in a standalone but as part of an ensemble, hes perfect\nand I cant say the same with Ed Norton if he is to reprise his role here.) The CGI version of this Hulk is also way\nbetter than his previous versions - rightly proportioned, just the right tone of green and with an improved face that\nlooks just like the comic version and even a bit like Ruffalos. Simply awesome!My gripe(s) with the movie though is\nwith its overly simple and uninteresting main plot. Tom Hiddleston is a charming lad but alas, Loki as the lone villain\nagainst such a powerful team is simply too weak and a non-threat. Throughout the movie, I never quite felt that anyone\n(except perhaps Loki himself) was in any kind of serious Jeopardy. Btw, speaking of weak enemies, how about an alien\narmy (more like a skirmish team) on hover-boards? Hmm....looks familiar....dont they work for Skeletor? Perhaps thats\nwhat the whole portal thing was about. Together, it feels just like a plot-line pulled from an episode of \"He-man and\nthe Masters of the Universe\". Also, if the alien mother-ship can be so easily destroyed, who needs the avengers? Just\nlaunch a few nuclear missiles at it as it comes through the portal, duh!Aside from that, there really isnt much else to\ncomplain, especially with the understanding that this movie serves as an introductory episode in the forming of the team\nmore than anything. Walking out the theater, I wanted to see more, and agree with Joss Whedon when he said the sequel(s)\nwill be smaller in scale. By that, I hope he means only the amount of CGI shots, not what is at stake or the magnitude\nof the catastrophe/adversary the avengers has to face, since the team bonding/friction seems to be the true strength of\nthe franchise. (Leave a big chunk of exploding machines and collapsing skyscrapers to other movies please, since we have\nprobably all seen enough of that by now.) Besides that, it also needs to be cleverer and more emotionally engaging. It\nwill then be perfect.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers is worth it!",
    "reviewBody": "Where to begin?! The Avengers is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force. From a fans point of\nview, the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books\nwhich were not previously filmed. From my point of view, a non-fanatic yet sucked into the hype,I had the inclination to\nwatch those movies, which I hadnt watched yet, with the superheroes in the Avengers and trust me it was worth it! Apart\nfrom the fact that a viewer would not know a particular superheros past, there is a minute back story which is worth\nnoting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in The\nAvengers.Casting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which Cobie\nSmulders (some of you may know her as Robin from \"How I Met Your Mother\") played, though small, were significant.\nScreenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had a USP of 3D motion picture, the effect changed the\nexperience.Action is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies, as not all fights are against the\nbad guy in particular, it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win, but\nhow? Comedy, interestingly, was present, I feel mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. but others were important\nfactors.This movie was not very dialogue-heavy but more straight to the point. Script-wise, the dialogues were indeed\neffective as well as pulsating for the the viewer.With an approx 2hr 30min running time, there are hardly any parts\nwhich one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as a one-time-watch there are particular scenes which really\nmake you look for them on Youtube and such.With bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of\nadrenaline in more than just a couple of scenes, The Avengers took me by surprise, and I hope it does the same to\nyou.P.S. I saw the ranking being extremely high, an 8.9 on IMDb, before viewing it and now I can see why it was so high.",

The film has perfectly edited action set pieces, no fast\nediting like say transformers and it benefits hugely. The first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up, but after that the\nlast hour especially is amazing. Credit has to go to the director, you really can tell he has a love for the source\nmaterial and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film. The drama is not\nas dark as say the dark knight. As people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments. The\nAvengers is simply amazing, Hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come,\nThe Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man, Skyfall, The Hobbit. The Avengers has started the summer blockbuster season with a\nbang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012. I highly recommend the Avengers.",

    "reviewTitle": "Quite possibly the best comic adaptation I have ever seen.",
    "reviewBody": "I am a HUGE Marvel fan. While I havent read most of the comics in years I still enjoy the characters. Stan lee is a\ngenius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and NOT be a poor, bad acted, cheesy, knock\noff. This movie, says it all. It shows everyone exactly why they love these comics. And that is simply that we can all\nbe more than the sum of what we are, or perceive ourselves to be. The prior movies are also very close to my heart. Iron\nman sold me on Robert Downing Jr. again as an actor and someone who can rise above. RDJ personifies Iron Man perfectly,\nthere is no other actor that could ever come close. The turmoil he has in this movie, the battle between his ego and\ndoing what is right despite personal loss is, well, its a work of pure art. Chris Hemsworth once again shows the world\nthat a man can play a god. He does it with grace and strength, and with my humble opinion; a human element, knowing that\nwhile he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically (except Hulk) he is also weak. He gives a character that\ncould have easily have been a \"I am better than you because I am a god\" a sense of humanity and humility. Thor is a\nprotector of earth, and he protects her with a fierce resolve. Mark Ruffalo, while I was a bit disappointed that Ed\nNorton would not be playing Hulk, I was happy and thrilled with the choice. Mr. Ruffalo shows all aspects of the Hulk\nwith smooth, fluid motion. The anger he has to contain, the control he has, he should teach a class on anger management.\nHe shows what I believe to be a true Hulk. The human that fights the beast within. Who among us can say we dont have a\nlittle of that in us? Chris Evans, he was the Torch, a cocky, show off that loved the lime light. I was worried about\nhim being a soldier, THE soldier. When I saw Captain America I was blown away by his scope. Something he continues to\nbring to this movie. He portrays The Captain as a soldier, a soldier out of time. And yet he is quick to adapt, and lead\na group of people that you wouldnt imagine could be a team. He honors Captain America with his portrayal of him. Jeremy\nRenner, I havent seen many of his movies, but the ones I have I have enjoyed immensely. He took a character that could\nhave easily been just a side note and made him shine. Showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin. I\ntruly hope that we get to see a solo act for him, I think it would be worth it. Scarlett Johansson continues to portray\nThe Black Widow with skill and grace. She is beautiful and deadly, the perfect Black Widow. Maybe a movie with her and\nJeremy Renner? Something to think about. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was inspired. And in this film you actually get\nto see more than just Nick Fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out. He shows that Nick Fury is\na bad ass to be reckoned with. Even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong. Clark Gregg,\naka Agent Coulson, I will tell you the truth here, I thought he was nothing more than a filler, but he nearly stole the\nshow for me. He did an incredible job, and has in all of these films. He shows an agent that is direct and very much a\n\"man in black\", but then you find that he, well, he has the biggest heart. And he delivers it with a fantastic dry wit.\nThe entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise, and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down\nin the face of impending death, but will fight it until there is no more of us.The last person I want to mention is Joss\nWhedon. I LOVE this genius, this man who can seamlessly put danger, action, and humor together. He did it with Buffy,\nAngel, and Firefly. I admire his work to the point that I will watch anything, and everything of his. He was the perfect\nchoice for this, and I can wait to see what he comes up with next.The overview of this movie is simply, words can no do\nit justice. It was not just a movie, it was truly an experience. You are sucked into the story, shown by so many\ndifferent aspects. I have been disappointed with some of the comic movies, X-men:Final Stand, comes to mind (someone\nplease tell me, WHERE in the X-men comics did Charles die? Last I checked he didnt). And with those disappointments\ncomes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to its hype. I was thrilled that not only did The\nAvengers, live up to its hype. It surpassed it. I have only one humble request, that the next one have Spider-man, and\nWolverine. I recommend this movie to everyone, as it is the personification of why we go to movies, and why this\nbusiness is a multi-billion dollar one. That we all need to escape our tired lives for a little while and be swept away\nto a world where, just for two hours, everything makes sense. The bad guys always lose, and the good guys win, with\nstyle. :)",

    "reviewTitle": "A lot of deluded fans out there...",
    "reviewBody": "While this is a perfectly decent movie, it certainly is not the 10 out of 10 some people seem to think it is worthy of,\na victim of the over hyped build up by the studio maybe. To be frank, I found all the Avengers themselves lived up to\nexpectations, but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore.\nThe truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited, no matter how well they play\ntheir roles. The Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the super hero genre(so far) and the Avengers doesnt\ncome close. Sorry guys I know I will have offended a few Marvel Maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you\nlook deep enough within yourselves, The Dark Knight is one of the best films of all time, the Avangers is not, plain and\nsimple. Worth watching but not worth the wait. Iron Man/Captain America are at least equally as good in their own right.",

    "reviewBody": "Just came back from the screening of the Avengers and I liked it! One of the two things I was scared of is if the movie\nwould give equal importance to all the characters(since this one has a lot of characters)meaning some characters get\nunder played and others get more time on the screen but that never happened. The movie was well paced as well.Another\nthing that I was skeptical about is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, I was kind of hoping that Ed Norton would do the\ncharacter but that did not happen. Never the less Mark did do a good job.So for me it was a 7.5 but I cannot give a 7.5\non rating so since the movie was good I gave it 8.You for sure can go and see the movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Its no Dark Knight but it sits comfortably at the number 2 spot.",
    "reviewBody": "There isnt really much plot going on here but what there is plenty of is character depth, Joss Whedon does a fantastic\njob of giving these characters so many levels that we never knew they had. This added depth to the characters really\ncauses us too feel for them in their moment of hardships. The character I ended up empathising for the most was actually\nBlack Widow which actually surprised me a great deal. But thats thing that Whedon does really well, he is used to\ndeveloping characters and yet again his fantastic writing does it again here. Now if you had your doubts about Joss\nWhedons directing ability then let me reassure you that you can put those fears to bed. Some of the shots he creates\nare absolutely stunning making for what will be some very iconic scenes from the movie. Not only did Joss Whedon direct\nthis action filled roller coaster he also put pen to paper and wrote it, as I said the plot isnt exceptional but the\ndialogue is utter brilliance. Every word out of Tony Starks mouth is absolutely hilarious making this funnier than a\nlot of comedies I have seen.Everyone knows the standard of the acting that is typically found in these Marvel movies,\nits pretty good but nothing really amazing. Robert Downey Jr. obviously returns as the obnoxious and downright funny\nbillionaire, Tony Stark. Everyone has seen this role before so you dont really see anything new here but you know what,\nthat doesnt mean it hasnt gotten old. As usual Robert Downey Jr. performs brilliantly, displaying one of the best\nperformances of the movie adding some comedy to an otherwise action filed adventure.Downey Jr. isnt the only one that\nshines here, Mark Ruffalo \" who I am a huge fan of \" plays Bruce Banner/ the Hulk brilliantly making for my personal\nfavourite Hulks we have seen to date and there is nothing I wish more than for him to get his own movie after this, but\nwe all know that isnt going to happen. Ruffalo also supplies us with many laughs throughout the movie and he also gives\nus a collection of the best action sequences in the whole movie with his \"Hulk smash!\"We see the return of Tom\nHiddleston as the menacing Loki and he plays the role absolutely beautifully. The first shot we get of Loki is harrowing\nwhich is mastered by the combination of Hiddlestons devilish performance and Whedons gorgeous directing. Loki not only\nmakes for a horrifying villain but his chemistry between Downey Jr. as Iron Man is priceless. If you werent fond of\nLoki in Thor \" like I wasnt \" your mind will be changed here he truly is an evil person making for an iconic\nvillain.Chris Evans and Hemsworth show us the performance you expect from seeing them in their individual Marvel movies,\nthey arent show stopping but are good enough for this movie. I feel as though the best moments of acting are when all\nof the Avengers are together, the chemistry between them is perfect, they all have their own different relationship\nbetween each other that can swap from hatred to best friends in a matter of minutes.Now the one thing that you dont\nhave to worry about in this movie is any of the main characters being pushed aside. When I first saw the trailer I\nthought that this will end up being Iron Man  Co. but trust me it isnt, all of the characters you want to get all the\nscreen time they deserve. Maria Hill played by the brilliant Cobie Smulders is one of the very few characters that gets\npushed to the side, but she was never really regarded as one of the main characters although I would have liked it if\nshe had a bit more ass kicking to do. Pepper Potts played by Gwyneth Paltrow makes a brief appearance which literally\nlasts a minute but you dont really care about that as this movie really isnt about her.The Avengers isnt exactly\nperfect, there was one thing I wasnt too fond of and that is that these movies are starting to feel far too familiar.\nApart from the stature of this movie in comparison with others it doesnt really vary its self from the other Marvel\nmovies \" Paramount Pictures \" the direction has the same old comic book action style which you can spot in all the other\nmovies. This isnt necessarily a bad thing but I can see many people starting to tire of it.I feel as though it is\nusually useless and extremely overpriced, the same can be said here. I didnt feel as though the 3D was necessary, if it\nwas it would have been filmed in 3D and not post converted like most films are these day. The 3D wasnt used like Avatar\nto fully engross me in the world, it just felt like it was there and there was nothing really too it, I know I would\nhave enjoyed the film just as much in 2D.The thing The Avengers does best is what it set out to do. It isnt trying to\nbe a dark superhero movie with a serious tone \" like The Dark Knight \" and thats good because trying to compete with\nthat is a ridiculous thing to do. The Avengers tries to be a comic book action-filled, Hollywood blockbuster and you\nknow what it does that perfectly.Trust me, if you are a fan of superhero movies then you will fall in love with this\nmovie, it is the movie we all wanted and expected, Joss Whedon has done us all proud and for that I would like to him,\nthank you very much. This is the perfect start to a Summer filled with brilliant movies.If you enjoyed you can check out\nmany more at: http://moviesoclock.wordpress.com/",

I had never heard of the director, Joss, until this film was made and to be honest looking\nthrough his film history i was having some doubts. Which i now take back, he has done a amazing job, He gives each\ncharacter all the amount of time they deserve, He created intense and epic battles and very humorous moments to top it\noff.To cut a long story short, this movie is amazing not perfect but amazing and it is a must see no matter what whether\nyou are a comic book fan or not.",

    "reviewBody": "I am from India so I dont have much of the comic book reading experience which others from US have. But Ive been\nwaiting for this movie for over an year now. I have read so many reviews and saw so many Trailers of this movie before\nactually going to the movie I felt like I watched 90% of the movie. But when I actually saw this movie it blew me away.\nFirst and Foremost kudos to Whedon for a wonderful masterpiece. Screenplay was extra ordinary and the way he put all\nthose powerful characters in one frame was simple brilliant. I dont know why but I always thought Iron Man will be like\nthe central character of the movie. But it was great to see HULK made a big impact than any other character. I saw the\nUK Press conference where Mark Ruffalo said that he was the first person to act both Bruce and Hulk. It was simply\namazing. I have never seen such a huge audience and rush for a English movie in so long after Avatar than Ive seen\ntoday. If you havent watched it yet. Do not waste any time. These type of movies come only once in a lifetime.",

To understand this movie I think that is entirely wrong.Yes to me watching them\nwould make the movie a bit more understandable but not as much as others imply.As long as you know who iron man, Thor,\nhulk, captain America and the other casts are you should find the movie just as amazing as I did. Even at that without\nthe knowledge of the other casts just knowing those 4 characters would be enough to find the movie entertaining.",

U hardly ever experience audience cheering and applauding in a cinema,but this exactly what happened when I was\nwatching this film.So dont wait for this to come out on DVD or blue ray coz u gotta watch this on a big screen and get\nlost in this along with others in the cinema. No doubt that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made,right up\nthere with The dark Knight!",

Thou some characters shine a little more than others, everyone are given their share of\nscreen time, it doesnt feel rushed, it doesnt feel forced, all scenes feel natural, and very well deserved to be\nin.You get to know the history about some characters like black widow, and hawkeye , and it remove all doubts about them\nbeing implemented in the team, everyone needs everybody in order to succeed. As i said before, avengers is transformers,\nwithout the sucky part, no one can say its another cgi fest, cause its an excellent movie.As to my favorite superheroe\nmovie, i have to say dark knight still is, cause the story was a little better, but avengers is following closely as\nsecond spot surelly. Just have to wait and see how dark knight rises perform.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers - a ,,SMASH,, success ( Minor Spoilers! )",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers have been Assembled, and with great success. Marvel did all the forework flawlessly, all the Superhero\nmovies leading to this 1 make sense now, small bits in those movies are directly or indirectly tied to this one. The\nDirector / Writer: Joss Whedon - did a great job with all the characters, he took some bits out of the old movies and\nconnected the dots, brought out the best in each and all of the characters. The Cast: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey\nJr.) - he was / is and will be the best choice to play IronMan, he just takes the character to a new level. Captain\nAmerica/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) - was great in Captain America, is absolutely great in this one, i feel like he can\nplay any superhero, he is just the superhero ,,type,, I liked the old costume a bit better but this does not stop the\nCap. being the Cap. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - The God of Thunder...what about that, he feels like the God of Thunder this\ntime, his swing got meaner ( since his ,,Solo Movie,, ) and he swings a lot. Hulk/Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) - The\nunstoppable Force / the Green Rage Monster - oh my: what can i say here - Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK, he ties the\nabsolute HULK: TVs Lou Ferrigno, who gives his voice to the big guy this time ( as he did in all HULK ,,Solo,, movies\n). CGI work on HULK is absolutely Fantastic. I feel that Ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor Banner better\nthan the others before him ( Eric Bana / Edward Norton ) and this time THE HULK can SMAAAASH ( 4 real ). Hawkeye (Jeremy\nRenner) is a nice addition to the Avengers Team ( he had a short appearance in THOR before ), i feel that he is a bit of\nan outsider in this one, maybe not that much screen time, but overall he just fits in nicely. Black Widow (Scarlett\nJohansson) finally we get a peek in her story outside of the Avengers, she does that catlike fighting that we loved in\nIronMAn 2, she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes,\nnicely done. Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury has a dominating presence in this one - we finally see the mastermind / spy /\nagent finally in work, and he works his ,,magic,, well. Clark Gregg as Agent Caulson is back and he brings not only the\ncomic character but the bad-ass Agent with a ,,punch,,. A nice addition is Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill. Last but\nnot least: Tom Hiddleston as Loki the main villain - Thors brother ( ,,hes adopted,, ) - He is the absolute villain,\nplayed so amazingly by Middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect, he just balances the\nmovie out - some of his scenes are fantastic.Now to the movie - i guess i can call it the best Superhero Team movie of\nall time. If u are not familiar with the other MARVEL movies u will not feel like an outsider, this is a Superhero Movie\non its own and a fantastic one. The pace of the movie does not feel to fast and to slow either, script and dialogues\nare all in place. The Movie has some of the most hilarious comic scenes ever put in any action ( or even some of the\nrecent comedy ) movies, the synergy between the main characters is perfect in any way. Some of the fight scenes will\nblow you out of your seats, i had some moments that i really wanted to just jump up - or rewind and watch again. Every\ncharacter has his moments ( or a few great ones) the team-fight scenes just take this to a whole new level. The CGI and\nFX are just what we are used from Marvel movies, and even upped a bit in this one. Set designs and costumes are also\nhigh quality, the design of the HELLICARIER, the MAcH7 suit is fantastic, i really liked Lokis outfit as well. Sound\nand Music department also did a great job, Alan Silvestri delivered again, the music really captures the mood of the\nmovie.Finally The Pros: The assemble cast. The character interaction. The Hulk. Black Widow interrogating Loki. The\nSMAAASH Moments ( a lot of them ). The after credit scene. The Cons: 1 thing - this is not a 3D movie - it has its\nmoments but if u can avoid watching it as 3D u will not miss a thing.Rating: 8.5 / Fan-boy Rating 9+",

Its\nstarts off with a bang with Loki making a nice appearance and just carries on from there. The best part of the film\ncomes in its last 1 hour. The actions sequences, the graphics and the spot comedy by the actors is superb. True credit\nto the director for making enough screen space for all the characters who have performed brilliantly. Special mention\nabout Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), outstanding performance by both of them. Now coming to\nthe storyline, its simple. Loki wants to conquer earth and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team The Avengers\nto stop the invasion. All the characters have their own special part to play in the film n they carried it out\nflawlessly. As i said before, the special feature of this film is its action sequences. I was amazed by the way they\nwere pictured. Really an outstanding job. And also the spot comedy, especially by Iron man and hulk were hilarious. In\nall, an excellent movie with lots of action and style. One of the best super hero movie of all time. Go for it.",

    "reviewBody": "Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related\nfilms, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.I feel\nall of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was\nunderused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his\nown, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and\ncollected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I\nwas never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the\nfilms funny lines coming from him.Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I\nthink he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared\npreviously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to\nstop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.Hawkeye was really\nwell played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I dont know why. But regardless he is a\ngreat character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark\nreplied \"Ok hang on then Legolas\". Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.The humour of the\nfilm mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a\nbit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There\nwere deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruces alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as\nwell, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).One small annoyance I had was the continuity on\nthe level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful\nbeing ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back\nabout ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight\nscene involving the three of them). Its just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them\nhad the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have\na lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thors Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it\ndoesnt even leave a scratch on Captain Americas shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible\nmaterial mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.I also kinda\nwished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, theyre always\nscattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit\nwhere all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them\nin the same place in the final battle.But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing\nand genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for\none was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it.",

    "reviewBody": "I am a DC Comics Fanatic; however, after watching \"THE AVENGERS\" movie, I am seriously considering switching sides. I\ngot to experience this movie in Matamoros, Mexico. It is oddly strange that the movie opened a week early in different\nparts of the world. It should have opened first in the USA before anywhere else. To top it off, I only paid around $6.50\nto experience the movie in 3D and inside an IMAX Theater. Here in the US tickets will cost around $12.25 in a regular\ntheater.\"The Avengers\" exceeded all my expectations of any \"Superheroes\" movie. It is a movie full of action from\nbeginning to end. This movie is very close to the animated movie \"THE AVENGERS\", but with a very pleasant twist since\nthe acting and the filming was believable. It is hard for me to choose who my favorite actor was. All of them did an\nincredible job performing their part. I do have to mention that even though the \"HULK\" was computer animated (CGI), it\nwas a breath of \"fresh air\" to see him in this movie. He was funny at times and also very real looking.",

    "reviewTitle": "Awesomeness in every way!!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie and it blew away my mind. The 2,5 hour sit wasnt long enough, I wanted more!!!!! Mark Ruffalo playing\nBruce Banner was best I have seen so far and seeing the Hulk smashing Thor into a building just after a heavy fight\nagainst the aliens was pure win and made my eyes tear of laughter! Than Loki saying something and gets interrupted by\nthe Hulk who smashes Loki into the ground afterwards saying \"puny god\" was another exact replica off the comic book hero\nI so love and enjoy. Just seeing this in that movie made the movie 8 out of 10. The two extra stars was cause the rest\nof the movie was just brilliantly put together, with the mayhem, the jokes, the storyline, the depths of most\ncharacters! Yes, I know people wanted to see more depths in the storyline, but come on, you got 6 Avengers with all\ndifferent stories, the villains who have there story, and you need to make a movie that isnt to long to let it stretch\nto much, but still contain every ingredient to make it a good movie. No, not a good movie, an excellent movie, like a\ntrue superhero movie should be. Dont compare this movie to other superhero movies!!! There you only have 1 character\nand 1 villain to explain and rest is story. Compare this when you saw the previous story lines of the main characters.\nSo watch Iron Man 1 and 2 and The Incredible Hulk (with Edward Norton, not as good as Mark Ruffalo, but you will know\nthe background better for The Avengers) and Thor and Captain America first! You will have enough knowledge to see this\nmovie and rate it excellent. Dont go here to expect a high intelligence movie or rate it with The Dark Knight (who was\ngood, but stand alone and DC comics, not Marvel, different studios, different styles!). Im waiting for The Dark Knight\nRises, cause I love those movies as well and the comics and Hulk and Batman are my two out of three most favorite\nheroes. Sorry Spidey, but your first real good movie has yet to come. This movie was awesome and had everything! Thank\nyou Josh Whedon for displaying the characters as if they were straight out of the comic. Thank you for this joy in my\nlife :)",

    "reviewTitle": "Most action-packed Superhero movie ever - but the plots a bit basic.",
    "reviewBody": "Well, for years Marvel Studios have been building up to this movie, teasing the fans, and providing a lot of solid\nentertainment flicks along the way. So does it live up to expectations? Well, for me at least, it certainly does. The\nmovie is often jaw-dropping, exciting, funny, and full of those fan boy moments weve all dreamt about. Thor vs The\nHulk? You got it. Thor Vs Iron Man? Yep, present and correct.The actors all do well and have many moments to shine, but\nRobert Downey Jrs Tony Stark gets a lot of the best lines, while Scarlett Johanssens Black Widow gets a surprising\ndepth to her character. Director Joss Whedon has skilfully avoided the Iron Man and the Other Guys movie this could have\nbeen - Avengers is a true ensemble piece with a script that skilfully blends the various heroes backgrounds and\npersonalities. Whedon has scored big time.Boy do you really feel the power of The Hulk and Thor - this is on a different\nscale to those characters solo movies. Mark Ruffalo is easily the best Bruce Banner ever, and The Jolly Green Giant has\nnever been so awesome. And theres a surprising amount of screen-time for some of the \"lesser\" characters - Jeremy\nRenners Hawkeyes is great and fan fave Clark Greggs Agent Coulson is again top notch.With all the awesome mayhem\ngoing on, poor ol Steve Rogers must feel mightily underpowered when up against The Thundergod, Ol Greenskin and The\nGolden Avenger; yet Capt America gets some good moments, too. Tom Hiddlestone is again excellent as Loki - a bad guy\nwith some weight always makes these movies work better. His confrontation with The Hulk is a sheer joy, the sort of\nthing which smacks you full in the face and makes you laugh out loud.My only gripe is the central plot idea. Marvel\nthemselves must have used it a hundred times at least in their comics, and if youre gonna do an alien invasion story\nwhy not use The Skrulls or The Kree - better known aliens? What you do get is a spectacular battle for New York between\nThe Avengers and the aliens. The latter are just cannon fodder but its terrific, stupendous stuff. If you want brooding\nintrospection go to The Dark Knight. Want Wham! Bam! Kapow! go here!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Big on effects  small on story",
    "reviewBody": "Let me make it clear that this along with the Dark knight returns and Django unchained are the 3 movies that I am really\nlooking forward to in 2012. After seeing the Avengers in 3D my first reaction was \"awesome\" but after thinking about it\nmore i felt let down with the story. With so many super heroes and just one formidable villain the Avengers were always\ngoing to come on top. So how would the story make it more difficult for the heroes was going to be a challenge.\nUnfortunately the script failed miserably in that department. Since Joss Wheadon (who is himself a great graphic novel\nwriter ) was helming the multi starrer, expectation was that he will have something more than just big effects. Super\nheroes movies like Spider-man  the Dark Knight are blockbusters but have a great story to tell as well. The Plot is\nsimple, Loki (Thors brother played by Tom Hiddlestone admirably ) decides to steal some \"Transsomething\" which opens\nthe gate to another dimension from where aliens would attack earth and Loki would rule it. Nick Fury assembles the\nAvengers: The Ironman (Robert Downey Jr brilliant as always), Captain America  The Hulk and Thor to fight against the\nother worldly aliens. The only problem is that these superheroes need to get along with each other and put their egos\naside to fight the alien invasion. The pros: Fantastic action, great visual effects, good one-liners, The HULK! The Con:\na weak script and a predictable plot.Its a great watch but could have been so much better. Cheers!!!",

Ive always said that an epic movie must\nmake you want to immediately see it again, and the Avengers has done just that.One of the many things that i loved about\nthis movie was that it is obvious that the production team has taken time to research Avenger comics and cartoons. I\nhave seen many criticisms made by the general public of a certain character (Hulk) and about how he is different from\nthe last two films. What these people dont realise is that the way the Hulk is portrayed in the Avengers is the way he\nwas created by Stan Lee  CO, if anything the Hulk is proof of the hard work and dedication that the production team has\nput in to making this movie.I could go on and on about the film, but im not. I just recommend everyone to see it in\ncinema. Perferably in 2D as 3D suck (in my opinion)! Avengers Assemble is the best film ive ever seen. . . so far. Stay\ntuned for Dark Knight Rises!",

    "reviewBody": "I am a huge fan of superhero movies, so I had to see this one in the cinema. I had my doubts about this one though. A\ngroup of individual superheroes who dont know how to work together and have to work together as a team. And yes, it was\njust this way how the movie started. The first half was boring. I dont like Jeremy Renner as an actor and this movie\ndidnt change that feeling for a bit. I just dont like \"hawkeye\".The Hulk (and of course Mark Ruffalo) was just...\nincredible. Yes, he is the best Hulk ever, but to be honest, it is Bill Bixby who has put Banner on the screen in the\nfirst place. We are now in 2012 and now Mark is the Bruce, who will be the next Bruce Banner? The Hulk was funny,\nsurprisingly good, entertaining.That the movie was about Thor and his half brother was disappointing. I thought we had\nthat fight one year ago.Now there is one thing that is bugging me. This year is all about competition between the\navengers and the dark knight rising. I dont think the new Spiderman will be in the same race, but I like to be\nsurprised. After seen this movie, I hope I will be satisfied in July with The dark knight rising. The Avengers just\ndidnt entertain me the whole time. Some parts it was just boring.The movie had action, a lot of jokes. The second half\nwas great, but I still dont rate a whole movie on the second half.",

    "reviewBody": "This really is a great superhero film, outclassing all of the previous films except Ironman I. This is a superb ensemble\npiece where all the characters shine. I have to say that Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner was a stroke of genius - as\nportrayed by Ruffalo, Banner is mild, humorous, hurt and self effacing. The Hulk here gets his best outing yet as a flaw\nin the previous two movies was that the Hulk was more likable than Banner and you spent the whole time waiting for him\nto change. This is not the case in the Avengers where Bruce Banner is just as entertaining and Ruffalo portrays him as\nhurt but not dull or sullen (as happened in the other movies). He manages to hold his own even with RDJ on screen (no\nmean feat!). In the film the best of the scenes involve Hulk and Ironman but everyone plays vital roles and no one is\nsuperfluous. Although, Tony Stark really does steal every scene and he finally gets to show just what Ironman can do.\nIronman gets his best action outing to date! If only Ironman II could have been even a tad like this. The script is\nwitty, coherent and just fun. Pepper Potts returns to continue the awesome romance with Ironman which really fits in\nperfectly with the film.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers....ASSEMBLED !! (contains spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "Back in 2005 since Marvel Studios had just been formed they were toying with the idea of making an Avengers film.At\nfirst they provided subtle hints in some after credits and well as in-movie scenes.Nick Fury appearing at the end of\nIron Man and Stark appearing at the end of Incredible Hulk movie(both talking about the avengers initiative) -we\nalready knew what was in store for us.Finally after 5 films and a wait of 11 years (in total) we get this great film\nfrom Joss Whedon (of Buffy:TVS fame) who takes the foundation that was built in prior films and brings together the\ngreatest team of superheroes in film history.Seriously I cant even begin to review this movie and i fear i wont be able\nto write much about this EPIC movie.This movie has to be seen to be believed .So ill just write down what i loved (or\nhated) about the movie character wise.LOKI Tom Hiddlestone gives an excellent portrayal of Loki. He appears more evil\nthis time around compared to Thor movie.My favorite Loki scene is where he demands the people of the city to kneel\nbefore him.reminded me of KNEEL BEFFOORE ZODCapn America Portrayed by Chris Evans.This time his character is more\nlikable compared to CA:TFA .He has the best dialogs (apart from RDJ) .The image of Chris as Human Torch is entirely\nwiped out from your mind, Best Capn scene :Why should i take orders from you? scene.Black Widow: portrayed by\nScarlett Johansson .She has a better role this time compared to Iron Man 2.Wasp should have been in the film instead of\nher.Hawkeye. Weakest Character of the movie.(and i am not talking strength wise or anything) Little to none back story\nprovided.Didnt get a film based on him apart from a few minutes in THOR. Also got converted into being Lokis minion\npretty fast . But the scene where he shoots at the Chitauri army without even aiming is bad-ass.Thor. portrayed by Chris\nHemsworth. Simply awesome. He has the best entrance scene in the film. Fav Thor scene : Are you afraid of a little\nlightening ?...No i am afraid of what comes later sceneNick Fury played by Muthaf***king Samuel Jackson .Finally he\ngets his own movie.His mother will be proud.And why was he trying to shoot the jet with a pistol?Who does he think he is\n? Tintin?Maria Hill played by Cobie Smulders. Kids back in the summer of 2012 your aunt Robin decided to join the\nAvengers. She had a good role BTW.Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr.On second thoughts he doesnt even play the\ncharacter.Robert Downey IS Tony Stark.Many people I know have just seen the Iron man movies and will go to see Avengers\njust to see him. Plays the character efficiently and wisecracking at his best . Fav Iron man scene : Suiting up Mark VII\nTrivia:(he wears a black sabbath shirt in this movie. Black sabbath wrote Iron Man theme in the first movie)Hulk/Bruce\nBanner Easily the best character of this movie.Mark Ruffalo surpasses Edward Norton in his portrayal of the green\ngiant.Each and every scene he is in is awesome. Finally we get to see a good hulk after two mediocre HULK films. Fave\nhulk scene : Loki Rag doll scene.Final mention to : AGENT COULSON portrayed by Clark Gregg. R.I.P Phil Coulson ! Marvel\nhas lost a great character with his death. His death is perhaps the biggest shock of this movie .And he couldnt even\nget his capn cards signed :(But at least he died with a bang. Agent Sitwell makes a brief appearance. fave Coulson\nscene ? all of em.. Trivia:Joss Whedon is known fr killing of beloved characters in his shows.Technically speaking :By\nHollywood standards This movie shouldnt even exist because it is way too risky. But somehow they have managed to pull\nit off flawlessly Marvel has already announced Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and Avengers 2 (where its pretty evident that the main\nvillain is Thanos). They should bring War Machine back in Iron man 3.his absence is noticeable. Honestly I dont think\nany other 2012 movie can beat this one (though the DARK KNIGHT RISES might just do it)BTW speaking of team up movies\n...does anyone remember the live action JLA movie of 1997 :p",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers assembles mind-blowing!",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers ReviewOn Friday 27.04.2012 I dressed myself with my Captain America t-shirt, and went to watch The Avengers\nin 3D. I was really excited and the movie was mind-blowing. I was expecting this movie to be good, but not as great as\nit was. I can still criticize it a bit. I think that the way the characters were introduced was mostly good, but I think\nthat the Iron Man introduction was not the best. I think they shouldnt showed Iron Man in his suit. For those viewers\nwho havent watched any of the earlier Iron Man movies; it would have been better if we saw Tony Stark/Iron Man without\nhis suit. I think its important that people who doesnt know the characters get to know the human inside the suit. That\nisnt much of a problem from me, who have seen Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This is just something which could have been a\nlittle bit better for those who have not seen any Iron Man movie. This movie is better than all The Transformers movies,\nbut the same thing is repeated here. The thing that Im talking about is that a kid is talking about what he saw, and he\nthinks its super cool and awesome. Ive seen this in many movies before and I dont like it much. In reality it would\nhave most likely have been considered a serious and dangerous incident. I dont think any kid would have reacted that\nway, because kids are smart enough to understand that what was happening was really dangerous. In this story, New York\nis being attacked from a different place in the universe. They get there through a portal that Loki opened for them. In\nthis story everybody should still have been shocked after they won the war. I really dont think there would be anyone\nwho was talking about it being cool. There is one woman who reacts in a much more realistic way, she was very thankful\nfor Captain America and The Avengers saving her and them all. That is realistic; they should all be thankful, but not\ntalking about it like it was being an action movie. What I mean is that in that situation a kid would be thankful, and\nnot talking about how awesome it was. In this story it was real, and then I think its weird that the kid is talking\nabout it like it was an action movie. I know that this is a movie, where the main point is to make it a movie that the\nwhole family can watch. I understand it well on the business part, because a movie that the whole family can watch is a\nmovie that gets more tickets sold. They really need to make as much money as possible, when they have so expensive and\namazing special effects. Not to speak of the costs of great actors, make up and great cameras. This is a hard movie to\nmake, and how great it is impressive, there are many great movie makers behind the movie. Joss Whedon have done an\namazing job directing this big movie. And Zak Penn did a great job writing the story for this movie, and also did Joss\nWhedon whos also the screenplay writer for this movie. The movie is an amazing mind- blowing breath-taking experience.\nI have never seen any superhero movie as amazing in special-effects. The movie has a great cast, with funny lines and\nyou really get afraid if they will die in the fight. Because you like the characters so much, and thanks to the earlier\nmovies you have begun to know them. Robert Downey Jr. is funny as in the earlier Iron man movies. And he plays his\ncharacter confident, funny, wise and brave. Mark Ruffalo makes the Bruce Banner character a nice and smart person. When\nhes the Hulk, he is not nice, he is dangerous and wild. Chris Evans plays the Captain America character wise, brave and\nnice. Chris Hemsworth plays the Thor character confident, god-like, wise and nice. Tom Hiddleston plays his character\nevil, mad, wise and mighty. He is theatrical actor, who also according to an interview was inspired by Shakespeares\nRichard the Third, when he was creating the Loki character with Joss Whedon. The movie is great movie, with good acting.\nStill I wonder how this movie would be, if it wasnt made to also fit for kids. Movies like The Dark Knight, Batman\nBegins and Watchmen, is great and not very child friendly. Again The Avengers is still great and I really enjoyed it.\nIts probably one of the best superhero movies ever made!",

    "reviewTitle": "Greatest Superhero movie ever made. Simple as.",
    "reviewBody": "Quite truly, this is a film that makes your mouth water while watching it. The man and the character that steals the\nfilm is Hulk played Mark Ruffalo. He adds this unique stint to the character commonly known to be scary ruthless\nmonster. He actually has the best comedy bits in the whole film. We all thought Iron man/Tony Stark would provide the\nhumour in the film, he does, but I feel he was casted down to be more of a super hero. You will understand what I mean\nwhen you watch it. This brings me to the point, would the Iron Man and Avengers movie franchise be any good without\nRobert Dwoney Jr. He is truly an incredible actor, that is so suited to the character of Tony Stark. I dont wanna say\nanymore, and I am so damn tempted to give away a couple of spoilers, but I have to resist to let you enjoy this fabulous\nmovie. GO WATCH IT.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers good but not as much as the hype",
    "reviewBody": "I just watched Avengers, 2 hours ago, and I personally dont think Avengers lives up to the hype it has got. Is it a\ngood movie? Thats a definite yes from my side, anyone whos into action movies and who knows these characters would\nenjoy the movie. But for people who dont really know much about these characters would get a little bored and might\nfind it hard to follow, as it happened with my friends. 10 of us went for the movie, 3 people though it was hard to\nfollow. Also one should know they are going for an action movie, action sequences are awesome, dialogues are OK not\nexceptional but OK. They have tried to make the movie funny, but there are only like 3 laughs out loud moments, with 2\nother that makes you smile. Interestingly enough Hulk was in 3 out of 5 of those moments. Iron Man is funny, but now wow\nfunny. Thor looked very ordinary in the movie, his acting was OK not wow. Captain America looks a little misplaced among\nthe super powered people, and sadly Black Widow has a lot more say in the movie than does Captain America. Hawkeye got\nhis moment to shine but isnt as focused as one who expect. Hulk and Loki, their acting stood out. Of course, Loki being\nthe main villain gets the most to do and Hulk was the funniest among them all, after he transforms. MINOR SPOILERS, its\nnice to see hulk finally learn how to control his transformation although how he learns it is never shown. There are few\nplot holes in the movie, we dont really understand how Hulk from being a raging uncontrollable monster because a hero\nall of a sudden and decides to fight for the avengers. Nick Fury doesnt get to do much apart from blow up a helicopter,\nCaptain America has some fights scenes before Loki brings his army but later Captain America didnt really play a big\npart in the movie at all. Aliens were below par, they didnt even spend time with the aliens, and they looked more like\nmindless beasts following command from their master, who is shown post credit and will not be named for the purpose of\nthis review. There are no twists and turns in the movie, the story could easily have been summarized in few lines as\nLoki - World Domination - Army - Avengers Assembles - gets his arse handed to him. Action scenes were AWESOME and its a\nvery action heavy movie. I hope I have not spoiled anything for you because I dont really wanna get into details of how\nthe movie actually plays. What I truly believe is you will not be bored watching the movie, but its not something as\namazing as say The Dark Knight.",

    "reviewBody": "I can not say anything more about THE AVENGERS; the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more. It didnt only\nentertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would; it told a great superhero team story.The characters were written\nperfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect\nbalance of comedy, action and drama (yes, theres a bit of that too and its good). Its everything a comic book fan\nwould want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got\nthe right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen\nbecause the trailers made the movie look like \"IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,\" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also\nstole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left\nbehind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so\nfar. Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I\nconsider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go\nand watch it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Yet another high for the comic book genre",
    "reviewBody": "The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the\nrelative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris\nEvans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.Adding to the mix, we have\ntight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief\nappearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to\nearth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well\neverything.On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin\nstories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to\ncreate a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears\nsidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.Whedon is far to\nsharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture\nthe balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.Complaints, the film does\nfeel long and there are shades of \"Transformers 3\" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters\ndestroying skyscrapers? The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson)\nin full, \"hell yeah\" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat. Loki wields his staff with aplomb,\ninitially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their\ncrazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your\nmedical training.The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm\ngrip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes\nacross on the screen.Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play\nComic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.So to the characters. Stark is just Stark, every mans wish\nfulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the\nradiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The\ntrusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portmans character is referenced but not shown on\nscreen.Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable \"old world\" can do attitude, which is a pleasant\nantidote to Iron Mans showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all\nthe chaos.Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The \"Hulk\" whose character\ndevelopment in real life now has morphed through three \"A\" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the\nbest two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.The Hulk is\nplayed rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains\nunder wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.Clearly the studio are thinking big,\nstay for the set up as it is clear the \"Avengers\" work is not done yet.Summary Yet another high for the comic book\ngenre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.Big, loud,\nexpensive comic book superhero mashup. Not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious\nthought, care and intelligence invested in the series.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",

    "reviewTitle": "About as spectacular and fun as you could wish for.",
    "reviewBody": "So glad to see that this movie did basically nothing wrong. I had my fears and doubts about it, I mean, so many big\nsuperheroes in one movie, isnt that like having too many captains on one ship? But no, everything I feared for got\ngreatly and cleverly handled in the movie and I liked it even far better than expected.The movie simply made all of the\nright choices it seemed. It used the best elements from the Iron Man movies, \"Thor\", \"Captain America: The First\nAvenger\" and the Hulk movies. Not only that, it also used the best of its main characters. Everybody of course has their\nown set of skills, powers and specialties, which greatly get used in the movie. Everybody gets to do something and gets\nabout as much screen time as the other. Many people thought that Tony Stark/Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., would\nsteal the show and get most of the screen time, since his character is the best and most fun one. But no, every hero\ngets their moment of glory in this movie and their moment to fully shine, even those without the superpowers, such as\nBlack Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson. But if you would\nforce me to point out one person that gets to shine the most in this movie, it would be the Hulk, played this time by\nMark Ruffalo. You have never seen the Hulk do so much awesome stuff and he also definitely comes across as the most\npowerful one of the bunch.Its so awesome and a true accomplishment that they actually pulled it off to get all of these\ncharacters and actors together for this one movie. Lots of characters from the Iron Man movies, \"Thor\" and \"Captain\nAmerica: The First Avenger\" reprise their roles in this movie, which makes all of the movies feel more connected than\never before.Its also a real accomplishment that they managed to keep the same style and tone throughout the entire\nmovie. This also caused Iron Man to not take over the movie for instance, with his wisecracking jokes, or Thor with his\nold fashioned, Shakespeare-like, dialog. The entire movie feels like one big whole, even when its purely focusing on\njust one of its main characters.I also really loved the interaction between all of the characters. They dont all like\neach other and some are even somewhat suspicious of each other. A true ego-clash if you will, which also results at\ntimes the different superheroes battling each other. This is the sort of stuff that Im sure of lots of fan-boys and\ngirls wanted to see. It also was a great move to make Loki the main villain of this movie. He was the best villain, in\nall of the Marvel superhero movies, in my opinion, so personally I was very glad to see him return, in such a big role\nagain. And yes, every superhero has a go at him at one point in this movie, which again, is something that fan-boys and\ngirls will be drooling at, especially since its all something truly great and spectacular to watch.And it really is a\nspectacular movie. Basically its being like non-stop, action fun and the movie its final perhaps is the best and most\nspectacular one you are ever likely to see. Truly some intense and awesome stuff to watch, when all of the superheroes\nfor the very first time truly work as a time and battle side by side with each other. Stuff that will give some people\ngoosebumps for sure, also because its filmed so extremely well, with the help of some great looking special effects as\nwell.But how about the story? well, its nothing too great or original but this hardly harms the movie. Its all about\nits main characters coming together and teaming up for the first time, on film. Really, the story is totally secondary\nand most of the time you wont even pay attention to it, since there is so much else good stuff going on screen! Joss\nWhedon did a more than great job with directing this movie.This is basically how great, fun, spectacular, big budget,\nentertainment should be like!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

    "reviewBody": "Earths Mightiest Heroes come together under one roof, led in battle by the perfect soldier himself Captain America, to\nface the Asgardian Villain Loki or as Hulk put it \"Pewny god\".First thing, what happens when u put Bruce Banner and Thor\nin a vessel way up in the sky and then Banner sets Hulk loose?Chaos like no other.I have to say watching this film will\nput you at the edge of your sit for the total 2hours 15mins. Sadly to say Nick Furys (Samuel L Jackson) acting was the\nweakest among the group and Mark Ruffalos was the best.But the hero to watch out for is the Hulk, this massive walking\ngamma radiation will make you laugh, trip, and then roll on the fall clutching your ribs.You dont believe me? Go get a\ndose of The Avengers.This movie is CGI invasion, almost everything at the final frontier (final battle) was CGI\nincorporated. So well crafted was the CGI and so well mastered were the actors themselves that they flowed with the\nscenes with ease.The comic relief in the movie were both The Hulk/Banner and Thor, these were the high notes:1. When\nthey took down an invading alien ship 2. When Hulk and Loki met face to face. 3. When Banner and Thor discussed Loki.I\nfelt the comic relief was well crafted into the movie; kudos to the script, the screenplay and cinematography were also\non point.The screenplay was done by Joss Whedon who worked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, he made every scene especially\nthe fight and battle scenes so interesting a sight. The comedy/action scenes were precise and will leave you gasping for\nbreath, as you never expect them. Even now that I told you where they are still... you wont see it coming, trust\nme.Directing in its part had to be done by a master director, because having all this heroes together, you have to be\nable to mix and match, so that none is underutilized and none is hugging the screen time, nice work Joss.And watch out\nfor cool camera angles, one had Captain America assessing a scene and we get to see it from a reflection.Again a\nwonderful performance by Tom Hiddleston (Loki), when he played Loki in the 2011 Thor, he did it so well I actually\nthought he knew the guy. Here too he did the same, I hope this wont be the last we hear of him.Wasnt so exciting, was\nthe Iron Man character (although that is my point others may view it differently), his humour always went over my head\nall through the movie. Black Widow and Hawk Eye, they held their own as they had no powers or a special suit, they made\nsure they had their share count of dead robotic bad guys. Captain played an important role in the end, but the thing\nthat was worth the watch in his character is the way he was oblivious about things. Thor was graceful as usual, but the\nHulk was the icing on the cake.All in all, go see it.",

    "reviewBody": "\"The Avengers\" is a great exercise in the art of fantasy movie-making. Its exemplary and superior production value,\ngreat performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some\nnonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end\ntechnology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background\ninformation for the uninitiated (those who havent seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk  The Iron Man\nfranchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and\nmesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot\ngiving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as\nthe best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest\nSuperhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVELs finest effort till date.\nDirector Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic.\nIts an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth. The On-screen chemistry between all the lead\ncharacters is uncanny and unparalleled. 10/10, a must watch for every Hollywood movie buff  Superhero aficionado.",

But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself,\nbecause Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!thats the thing about this movie, its not\nreally a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not\nreally a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with\nthat somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.You can really fell that Whedon knows and\nloves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for\nbuilding the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This\nmovie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.For the first\ntime, i felt a nerdgasm, Im not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at\nall, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.I love good movies, i do, i\nknow a lot of movies and Im not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this. The avengers is one of\nthe best experiences i have ever had in my whole life. i will see it at least 3 times more",

    "reviewTitle": "Were not a team. Were a time-bomb!",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers gathered huge expectations since it was officially announced in 2010. When separately the marvel comic\ncharacters can rock in the movies, then what massive consequences can happen when they are assembled altogether. From\nTony Stark to Clint Barton, The Avengers group is subversive and totally heroic in their move. A Lot of money\n($220,000,000) is involved here as there are spectacular special effects and eye-popping destructive acts. Till now,\nthere is a huge chaos created allover revolving the release of the movie, even in India. A huge profit is estimated for\nthe movie. Anyway, Lets see how this movie works.Nick Fury is the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace\nkeeping agency. The Tesseract is an unknown source of huge sustainable energy that can come to much need of planet\nearth. But when Loki (Thors Brother) steals The Tesseract and tries to demolish the earth as directed from Asgard, Nick\nFury assembles The Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Hawkeye to eliminate the\nextra-terrestrial attack on earth and save humanity. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury does a perfect job. Even not being a\nsuperhero, his special role as a colonel in every marvel hero movie is commendable. Tony Stark aka Iron Man is said to\nbe the salient character of Avengers even Captain America is the first one of them. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is\nremarkable, humorous, smart, sleek and heroic and most of all perfect from every nook and corner. Without Iron mans\ntechnological help and cleverness, The Avengers would have to face much problem.Steve Rogers aka Captain America, the\nfirst Avenger does here a nice work indeed. To him, saving Americas glory and assets is everything and so he does.\nChris Evans as Captain America was a Joy to watch and he was the only hero that can stand beside Iron Man\nshoulder-to-shoulder.Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, is the strongest and mightiest and toughest pillar of the Avengers.\nEven Edward Norton was the leading hero of \"THE INCREDIBLE HULK\", Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk here also gives much justice\nand creates a great atmosphere of strength and destruction.Chris Hemsworth as Thor (Which we have seen previously in the\nmovie named on him) was indescribable. He is said to be the God Of Thunder from Asgard and here with his mighty hammer,\nhe yet again creates a great appearance and makes a strong impact in defeating enemies. Nothing is greater than Myst and\nGods, in that case. Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson was effective as the only female\nsuperhero character in the midst of powerful masculine superheroes.Clint Barton aka Hawkeye was fine and he seemed to be\nthe weakest among the Avengers but still he was effective in his negative pre-climax and heroic role in the climax.Tom\nHiddleston as Loki, Thors brother seeks revenge on his brother and tries to rule the world as the only God. So, the\ncharacter with so much vengeance and thirst and also battling the Avengers all alone had to be very important for the\nmovie and so it was. Among all others, the most important one was Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and he did a\nsplendid even The Avengers movie puts an end to his character forever. Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan\nSkarsgrd, Gwyneth Paltrow  more - everyone carried out their roles splendidly.It was very lucky for me to watch the\nmovie in 3D as the remarkable special effects by Chad Ball, Roland Blancaflor, David Boucher  more and Visual effects\nby Visual Effects by Shaun Friedberg Pyrokinesis, David Abbott, Nada Abdou  more was the most important substance of\nthe movie. Massive Destruction, Aliens, Super natural powers - everything was excellently perfect. Cant be better than\nthis. Also, I would specially recall the use of humor in the movie that made people laugh at times. Also, the dialogues\nof the movie are excellent. Some awesome ones like - Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack! Tony Stark: I have a\nplan : attack!  Thor: Hes my brother Natasha Romanoff: He killed 80 people in 2 days Thor: Hes adopted.Even, this is\nthe second directorial of the director Joss Whedon, he does a commendable job and I doubt if anyone could have done it\nbetter. Joss pens down the story with Zak Penn with the help of the writing by Stan Lee  Jack Kirby (The original comic\nbook writers) and gives birth to a very efficient story that perfectly got along with the movie. Finally, when I saw in\nthe final scene where Tony Stark  Pepper Potts were redesigning devastated Stark Tower and only the A stood among the\nfive letters, I was fully assured that the movie did not intend to glorify any one Marvel Hero but glorified their team\nwork as AVENGERS. And if as the end of the movie hinted is true then get ready for THE AVENGERS 2 because Nick Fury said\n\"We Need Them And They Know That Very Well\".The Avengers is one helluva ride of destruction, fighting evil  heroism.\nKids will love it and so will the elders. Make some time, take your family, put on your 3D glasses, pop some corns in\nyour mouth and have a epidemical time. If you miss this one, consider it as a huge loss.",

    "reviewBody": "As 10/10 as it gets!What makes Marvel great is that each of their Avenger solo studio films are packed with emotion and\ndraws the audience in with relatable characters. The viewer cares about them and gets invested in to their story and\ncharacter development. Now, magnify that times ten! Add way better action then weve seen from them in the past and you\nget the greatest genre work ever put to film with the Avengers. This movie more than lives up to the hype! I was on the\nedge of my seat several times during the film and I cant believe how fast over two hours flew by. Avengers is THE best\ncomic adaptation film of all-time, period and end of story. That doesnt take away from past exceptionalism, even past\nMarvel films themselves but Avengers just delivers beyond what weve seen before from anyone. As good as Spider-Man 2 or\nTDK were, you really cant compare them because they operate on a smaller canvas and deliver far less notes. After\nseeing Avengers, youll know exactly what Im talking about if youre being honest with yourself and fair to the movie\nitself.",

    "reviewBody": "GRAAAAH! Oh my god. The sheer power of this film, how it is able to pull of one big magic trick and somehow cram\neverything in without coming off as a bloated or lazy being that lives off a diet of eye-candy and Clichs. No.\nAbsolutely No! The avengers takes the harder but more fulfilling route making it more of a god like the mighty Thor, and\ngod that deserves attention and respect for all mankind.I have personally seen this film twice and not once has its\nquality withed with each viewing. It has genuine sense of epicness and suspense that almost makes you think everything\nwill be all right in the end, Meance provided by Loki resonates perfectly, in fact in one of his scenes I felt my heart\nrate going up! literally. If you only know a bit about the film before seeing it, ;et me tell you he does things that\nyoud didnt expect which only adds to it all. The visual splendor is huge and with the acting coupled with it\nbelievable. The fight sequences can be narrowed down to three things: Tesserect theft, Hellicarrier attack and NY final\nshowdown. It makes you stay on for the ride, it makes wish it could have gone on. Even my family found themselves in\njoyful hysterics at the end of it!",

    "reviewBody": "This was a terrible film. The lines were cheesy. The action sequences were predictable. Every sequence that rolled out\non screen had already been done to death by countless action films before- there was nothing new, fresh, catching or\nanything innovative for that matter in the way the film was shot, scripted and acted. Just when I thought things\ncouldnt get any worse, the low brow, tasteless racist slanderer of Captain America (Yes I know he was doing it to show\nthis mindset was still of that of a white American of the 1940s) towards Samuel Jacksons character made me want to\nwalk out of the film. And Im not even black. A complete waste of money on my behalf. To see this film receive the high\nacclamation that it has just goes to show how brainwashed the general population has become due to the continuous\nrelease and production of these utterly mind-numbing, idiotic films.Not even worth a star.",

    "reviewBody": "All I could think of as the end credits rolled was, MORE PLEASE!!! I would gladly have turned around and watched it\nagain!The Avengers is not a deep thinking film. You will not leave the theater enlighted or confused. It wont cause you\nto re-think your world or your ideals, it wont be a debate provoking film amongst your other intellectual friends...\nbut it WILL leave you thoroughly entertained!!! Those who are not of the genre will call it \"mindless banter\" and scoff\nat it. Those who are OK with being transported temporarily to a place where they can forget everything for 2 1/2 hours\nand just enjoy it, they will love it!The previous movies have given substance, background and depth to the characters\n(most of them). They feel familiar and \"make sense\". The story line is simple and predictable, Evil returns, wants to\nenslave Earth, team of superheroes assembles and drive evil away... or do they? (stay through the ending credits, trust\nme).Its not the \"super story\" that keeps you glued to your chair. It is everything else. Somehow you are not the\nslightest bit annoyed (or care for) the predictability of the story. I dont think a better director could have been\nchosen for this film. Joss Wheddon has just the right amount of childhood wonder still in him to re-create something\nmagical ... it was like.. watching the coming book come to life!! Please tell me there is a sequel!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Whats great and not so great about Marvels The Avengers",
    "reviewBody": "Yes, its a superhero (super cast) marathon, insane CGI and production values at its best, blah, blah, blah. Everyone\nknows that, what people dont know is why Avengers will work for most and not for a few.i believe the real heroes of\nthis movie are two guys Joss Wheton (Director/Writer/Screenplay Writer) Seamus McGarvey (Cinematographer) I have\nobserved the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay.\nAs a film student myself i can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have\ntwo different work spaces (unless they are people who get along on a very personal level) they would never get it\nrolling on film. Thats why people like Christopher Nolan/Peter Jackson take their movies into outer space. OK, Enough\ncrap. Whats bad?The fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic (non human)\nplots. The story moves in a predictable direction and the thrills were expected (only well presented). The fact that\ntheres currently no Spiderman/Xmen in Marvels Avengers scheme of things will disappoint a few fans (Although Marvel\nStudios are onto Sony Columbia and Fox to get individual character rights for sequels). So surely a group of people will\nfind it ordinary or not worth their time.Whats good?You will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with\nthis plot have been made any better at all? All the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much\ncharacter development and depth as a 142 min film couldve allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it\ninto the trailers and get audiences rolling in. The cinematography is fantastic for example there a couple of scenes\nwhere we (camera) are in the car and we see ourselves rolling! and the action scenes are done so that you can\nregister/admire them properly (Michael Bay should have a look into this!). Joss Wheton is top class all through. Classic\nbig screen adventure!For the majority of the fans. You will clap, cheer, hoot at Robert Downey Jrs quirks, Dr.\nBanner/Hulks smash comedy and will admire Chris Evans commands as Captain America, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Chris\nHemsworth as Thor. The visuals are fantastic, the plot is entertaining all through. 3D is an added feature which i\npersonally enjoyed tremendously. If you have a group of friends to go with, this movie will surely make your weekend!",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing mix of heroes, nothing short of sublime",
    "reviewBody": "Here is the movie they were preparing us for. Iron Man. Captain America. Thor. This was where they would\neventually go. And brother, it didnt disappoint. Joss Whedons magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo\nand more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called superhero movies made. The movie featured\nan interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a\nspectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, Avengers is a thrill\nride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of\nthrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction.\nThe one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron mans quips are just as well timed as always. Enhancing the\naction and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable\njob in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it.\nthe Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a\nbeautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson\nis a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the\nrole. The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I dont understand why the X-men werent\nconsidered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues). But the movie is a wonderful viewing\nexperience and by all means, a treasure. Must see for the summer of 2012.",

    "reviewTitle": "One of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever!",
    "reviewBody": "A culmination of several movie franchises, THE AVENGERS certainly delivers. There could have been many ways that the\nstudios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director: Joss Whedon (former helmer of Buffy the\nVampire Slayer and Firefly on TV as well as an actual comic book writer for Marvel Comics). Whedon knows his stuff and\nhe creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever; the whole film reads as if it was an actual\nMarvel comic book!Whedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly\ncreates an epic storyline that makes sense. The tesseract (known to comic fans as the cosmic cube) that was the focal\nplot point of CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) has been recovered and being studied closely by the government\nwhen Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the villain of the previous THOR (2011) movie appears and takes control of it. In response,\nCol. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson, in his usual badass self) decides to form a small but lethal response team: Iron Man,\nCaptain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor. If they can get along and work together then they might have a\nchance to save the world.Being the top billed character because of box-office receipts, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)\ngets the best lines and almost steals the entire show. His wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the Avengers,\nCaptain America (Chris Evans, playing the straight man to everyone else) and puts the latter character in a\ndisadvantage- the movies lone weakness is that Cap doesnt get to do much other than act as a foil to the larger than\nlife Tony Stark. Thor (Chris Helmsworth) does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both\nHawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) give much needed humanity since they are the only members\nof the team that dont have superpowers. But the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is\nMark Ruffalo, who plays the volatile Hulk- Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner as a smoldering Stanley Kowalski, always seemingly\nin control yet has a temper like nitroglycerine- his Banner is different from the brooding Eric Bana of 2003s HULK or\nthe timid Edward Norton of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008); you dont get to see much of Ruffalo compared to the others but\nhis character is the most intriguing of all. Hiddleston is adequate as the pouty, scheming Loki but you cant help but\nbelieve that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding him.The movie is almost perfect but does fail\nto take chances with their characters. Evans Captain America is a direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you\nwished he might have been given more of an edge, like the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Captain America: a slightly\nracist do-gooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesnt measure up to his 1930s morality. If only the movie\nhad been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2  hours it might\nhave been a systematic one.In the end though, there is something for everyone in this movie, from the constant action\nscenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clichs. Highly recommended!",

    "reviewTitle": "It is a great movie...",
    "reviewBody": "This many reviews cant be wrong and now Im part of that group. I wont spoil it with much details but the script is\ngood, the directing is great and the action is just amazing. The biggest surprise for me was Mark Ruffalos part. I was\nhighly skeptical because of his look and the Hulks but after seeing the entire movie I have to agree that he is the\nbest Hulk version thus far. I am simply amaze at both Weldon and Marks work. Just wow.The are two disappointing things\nfor me though. First is Hawkeye. Hes only smiles once in the movie and I bet youll have a hard time finding that part.\nThis is because Ive grew up knowing Hawkeye more as a comedic/serious character and not just a pure serious character.\nThat doesnt mean his part in the movie wasnt great. Second is Banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside\nthe team. Sure one can make guesses but I much prefer that one was provided; either as Hulk wanting to protect others as\nhe usually does, or as Banner and Hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept\nhim. But even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives. That was just jaw dropping for me and\nthe Avenger teammates LOL I have to suggest to those that havent already watched the movie to pay close attention to\nthe dialogs. Many of the lower reviews, especially from film critics, is because they really dont pay attention to the\ndialogs and rate it down. Plus, youll see why I enjoyed the Hulk immensely in this movie.Many people are turned off on\nthe fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the so-called hardcore comic fans. I will have to remind everyone here\nthat for most comic superheroes the big, world killer scenarios are from outer space, from aliens. It doesnt matter if\nits DC or Marvel, its exact SAME situation. Its not a copy of Transformers 3 since Michael Bay made up the story in\nthe first place and did a poor job at it. Transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for ages.Dont be\nsurprise but eventually Superman will have Doomsday and his portals. Green Lantern is guardian of the UNIVERSE, dont\nsee how one gets upset at an Alien force coming in to destroy Earth or any other planet that is in their area of\nprotection. Batman and the Justice League will have their Aliens and so forth. Really, what are you complaining about\nthen? That there are too much Aliens? How are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story?\nThats what I thought. Mindless comic book fans that \"think\" they know better...pffft.If youre happy with just the\nsuperhero fighting human villains on and from Earth fine. Stay that way. But dont go bitching because eventually the\nstory of ALL superheroes will involve aliens. Youre precious Batman will involve aliens, its just not there in the\nform of movies YET. Joker has a big part in aliens and Earths destruction. Get with it people.As for people complaining\nabout the lack of character development well the answer is simple. Go and watch the respective movies about the super\nhero you are disappointed about. There are two Iron movies, 2 Hulks, One captain America, One Thor. And while Black\nWindow and Hawkeye dont have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them. They are the\nless popular heroes of the team thats why. So again, why are people even complaining about this issue in the first\nplace?Seriously though I sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly, even hardcore fans.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers: Marvels on top, so far.",
    "reviewBody": "Marvels Avengers...A well paced movie that delivers from the beginning. Its hard to review this awesome movie without\ngive some spoilers, but Ill try to do my best, promise.I tried to keep my expectations low about this movie before it\ncame out, because watching this all- star cast playing the \"superheroes\" is exciting itself. you have to add Samuel L\nJackson as \"Nick Fury\" and a very good CGI work pumped up by a big amount of money. But I have seen a lot of movies with\ngreat casts and high budgets going down (cough *batman and robin* cough), so I decided to stay calm and not to get\nhyped.So the movie started with a very decent action scene that sets up the whole plot fast and effectively. Even when I\ntried to forget what this was about, I couldnt help myself and I was sold after the ten first minutes. Why? Because you\ncant help it!! you get to go in deep with every main characters motivations. The action never stops growing and the\ntension last until the very last minute. Its impossible not to fall in love with movies like this! Every relationship\nbetween the superheroes are well established and when the moment comes, it shows.What are they avenging?: Spoiler! Its\nHulk well done in this movie? Hell Yeah!! (finally) Its Tony Stark above the rest of Avengers?: Nope, hes part of an\nawesome team!Is this movie worth to see on cinemas? oh, please, oh, please, dont miss it. Watch it at least once. 9/10\nAt the same level of \"the dark Knight\"CONS: Didnt like the 3D. - Black Widow should have kept her long hair. For the\nrest, no complains.",

    "reviewTitle": "THE AVENGERS: assemble and watch (NO SPOILERS)",
    "reviewBody": "Oh my god, I cant even think straight right now. If you can put adrenaline, passion, love, sex, and everything similar\nyou can think of in a blender, puree it to hell, and down a dozen barrels of the concoction, you might just end up with\na feeling similar to the one I had after watching THE AVENGERS. To say it is brilliant would be a gross\nunderstatement. It would be like saying the sun is warm or the universe is decently spacious. The movie is a miracle.\nAnyone who has even a slight understanding of the marvel universe, or has even seen the recent standalone pictures of\nThor, Captain America, Iron Man, and the Hulk could fathom the insurmountableness of the task of putting them all\ntogether in one single two and a half hour movie. Thats like asking to fit the Hulk in a pepsi can. I cant even begin\nimagining how one would even start with it, but if anyone can do it, it had to be Joss Whedon (Director).I know a lot of\npeople might be going to watch this movie just because of the lead characters, but for me the pull was knowing Mr.\nWhedon was at the helm. For those of you havent heard his name, think Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly. I\nhave loved all his previous works and expected a decent product from him. The trailers were a bit unconvincing though I\nmust say but I was stoked enough by the time I entered the hall (I was the only guy there wearing an Avengers t-shirt).\nThe movie had a lot to live up for, mainly decades of comic book lore and the expectations of generations of fans, and I\nam glad to say that it not only meets them but surpasses them in Hulking leaps and bounds.First up three words \" HULK!\nHULK! HULK! The show stealer, the show stopper, the master of ceremonies, the winner of the spotlight award - the hulk\nyanks the movie all unto himself. If I loved the hulk before, I revere him now. He smashes, he busts heads, he is\neverything you expect from a superhero and more. You have to see it to believe it. His scenes will leave you screaming\nwith joy and jumping from your seats whooping and dancing in the air. Hulk is the man! And Mark Ruffalos world weary,\nresigned Bruce Banner complements the severity of his alter-form completely. While the hulk is brutal, Banner finds\nrepose in avoiding conflicts through wit. When the green rage monster will break bones at the slightest insult, Bruce\nwill take everything thrown at him with a pinch of salt. Its the perfect duality and my favorite character of the whole\nensemble seeing that the Hulk has always been one of the most relatable superheroes of all time. The very concept of\nlosing yourself to anger is a very humanly intrinsic characteristic, and knowing this allows you to appreciate his\nawesomeness even more.And yes, yes, I have not forgotten \" Scarlett Johansenn (Black Widow) is there too and she kicks\nass like never before. She is stunning and beautiful and sexy and depending on your sexual preferences, the second best\nthing in the movie (the first still being the Hulk). Her story opens up even more and so does her relationship to\nHawkeye (Brett Renner) who is also marvelous in his role too.The most amazing thing in the movie perhaps is not the\naction (of which there is tones) but the amount of content that they have been able to cram into a single film. The\ncharacter development is brilliant and even former fringe players like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Coulson\nget more etched out here than in all their other movies put together. All in all, each character is better represented\nhere than in their own movies (Iron Man and Thor might be the only exceptions).The story itself is a pretty simple one\nwith Loki (Tom Hiddelston), banished from Aasgard at the end of Thor drifts off into space, returns with an alien army\nto take over the world, and Nick Fury assembles the avengers to defend us. But like they say, the devil is in the\ndetails, and so it is here. This movie is riddled with amazing conversations and meticulously placed jokes, most of them\noccurring in the midst of epic battles. Each characters relation with the other gets etched out during the course of the\nstory and by the end what we have is a comprehensive understanding of what the Avengers are capable of \" and with a\nmajor reveal at the end of the credits showing us the next villain - you realize that this was in fact just a two and\nhalf hour long prologue to what is yet to come. God bless us all.IN SHORT: There is action, there is humor, there are\nheroes and there are villains. I wont spoil anything for you by describing any scene in length or short, because the\nwhole thing is that amazing. This is a ride everyone must take for the love of their inner child. Unlike the recent dark\nturn comic book movies have taken since Nolans Batman, The Avengers embraces its roots unabashedly. Think of all the\ncartoons you watched, the comics you read, and the toys with which you played out fantasy fights. Whedon has captured\nthem all. This is a movie meant for pure joy, and if you are even half as in love with any of the characters as I am,\nyou will walk out with a major pain in your face muscles from carrying a ear to ear grin from title shot to credit roll.",

    "reviewBody": "After a long time of waiting finally The Avengers is released. I have waited for this movie from last 3 years. Iron man\nseries is one of my favorite superhero series and I love to see every movie in which Iron man was there. So after long\ntime I went to cinema hall with my cousin and watched the assemble of 4 superhero Hulk, Thor, Iron man, Captain America\nto save the world with help of Director Nick Fury and his agents Black Widow and Hawkeye.As movies starts it is more\nconcentrated to storytelling and linking of the previous movies Ironman 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and\nHulk. The first half part is about summoned of these superheroes. Another part is packed with superb visual effects and\nsound effects also dialogs are awesome. Especially Iron mans dialogs are hilarious and quick witted.The movie is well\nbalanced with story and action scenes some movies are failed to adopt this phenomenon such as Transformers 3 Dark side\nof moon and Ghost rider 2 spirit of vengeance. These movies are concentrated to only special effects and lacked in story\nwhereas The Avengers has overcome from this. A mention about Phase 2 sounds like a another part of the Avengers that is\npart 2. This is one of the best action movie, watch it in theater that would be better than home. So go to cinema hall\nspend money its worth it.",

    "reviewTitle": "The best Superhero movie i have seen",
    "reviewBody": "This was one hell of a mind-blowing, fantastic ensemble. I entered the theatre with some trepidation. Dont get me\nwrong, I love Joss Whedon. His Firefly, Dollhouse really impressed me with their thoughtful insights to complex subjects\nand excellent stories with witty dialogs. But this being a superhero movie with characters so diverse, I suspected this\nmay just be a mash-up of said characters with some good battles with Whedons trademark one-liners. Boy was I\nstumped.This movie never failed to keep my mouth open with shock and sheer awe at what I was watching. Also laughter.\nThis was a movie I will not forget. Or be satisfied with watching only once.Witty dialogs punctuate every minute every\none of which are neither clichd, overdone or badly timed. But humour is only part of its brilliance as story too is\npretty good with some amazing, some awesome, some sad and some thoughtful moments. The movie is very well paced, so much\nso that I barely realised the 140 minutes passing by.The casting was perfect, with all the characters coming over from\ntheir respective movies. Except Bruce Banner who was now played by Mark Ruffalo taking over from Ed Norton. In the Hulk\nmovies, Bruce was a scientist struggling with his inner demons threatening to release his darker (greener) alter ego.\nBut here, he needed to be confident, funny, witty, smart (which was seriously downplayed in the 2 Hulks) to have any\nchance against such powerful characters. Mark Ruffalo carries his character with remarkable panache and delivers a\nmemorable character.The rest of the cast were amazing. Robert Downey Jr as Tony, the self- loving, arrogant and\nover-smart playboy, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the regal guardian come to stop his brother in his tracks, Chris Evans as\nthe out-of-place hero who tries to fit in, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow who has a substantial role to play (not\njust eye-candy though she delivers plenty of that too), Jeremy Renner as the stoic and unshakable Hawk-eye and of\ncourse, Samuel Jackson as the enigmatic commander, Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston, on the villainous side is amazing as the\nnihilistic, ego-maniacal Loki who is now stylish, confident and devious in contrast to his Thor persona where he is more\nchildish in his harried quest for revenge. Every character is given a major role with no-one sidelined or underused. All\nthese characters from different eras, locations and occupations are blended beautifully though not without conflicts\nwhich are highlighted as a major plot point. This was a much better idea than merely bringing them to save Earth and\nexplaining away these differences which any other director would have easily done.This brings me to Joss Whedon. With\nSpielberg giving us mediocrities like Tintin, Indiana Jones and War of the Worlds, this comes as a respite from old and\nboring directors who have been ruling big-budget screen-space for far too long. With X-Men: First Class bringing forth\nMatthew Vaughn, this too will bring Whedon to the limelight and hopefully, spur producers to give this underrated talent\nmore opportunities.This has been my movie of the year(so far) and the best Superhero movie I have EVER seen. Batman does\nnot count to me as a \"superhero\" movie which is why this wins the title.",

I have never been into Marvel and my introduction to the world of Marvel was Iron Man\nand the Hulk some few years back...yet this movie has made me want to look for these comics and read them. Care was\ntaken in developing this work and it shows. The dialogue was witty, action was great...amazing how they all work so well\ntogether in the movie. Beautifully produced. I already want to see it again!Can I say though, for Cineworld Milton\nKeynes, 3D was not too fab, if you are seeing in 3D, the action scenes are where 3D works best, all other normal\ndialogue scenes are clearer with the 3D glasses off.So there you are, what are you waiting for? Go see this movie...well\nworth every last penny!......by the way did I mention a couple of hot sexy guys?(*wink)",

Im not sure why, but even with the 3D effect - to be\nhonest, didnt make much difference, until the final battle sequence - but even then it was few and far between! I think\nthis film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk - was that\nsupposed to sound impressive? There were a few funny bits, especially with the Hulk, but on the whole the film just\ndragged on without a real purpose - I hope the supposed sequel will be much better!",

I thought of skipping this movie (figured it was overkill to have so many heroes in one film),\nbut good reviews and the fact that it had Joss Whedons prints all over it tempted me to go see it anyway. And I was not\ndisappointed. In fact, I was amazed!The threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular. But what really makes\nthis movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort. And\nit is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes youve come to love. I felt it was a well-paced movie, where every\nhero got to shine in their own way. Annnnnd I think Coby Smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this\none: honey, that outfit was...ehm well tailored. ;)If you havent seen this one yet: run (dont walk damnit) to the\nnearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 2,5h ride, thatll still leave you yearning for more!",

I think it couldnt have been done any better then this,like the cast itself\nbeing heavy and the expectations and hype added it has to be presented with perfection,apart from the loud bangs and\ncrazy clashes between the avengers every other 5 minute which was quiet fun to watch indeed but the lack of story\ntelling again over here kept me silent for a while and gaze only at the screen discovering in this case suddenly a stunt\ndouble instead of a black widow(Scarlett Johanson) now that kept me even more silent only later to learn the movie is\nfull of errors here and there in the background but when the action in the middle is just to intense to observe the\nsides i know who cares.(i got bad seats BTW) the earlier reviews highlight the emerging and graphic part of the film\nwhich i must say were amazing and a lot of new stuff to see.To conclude in the end the movie is designed as a summer\nblockbuster with marvels best joining hands together and fighting the evil Loki whos job is to make people obey and\nworship him.So in the end a movie you would go to and enjoy from the start till the end only to walk out\nthinking...yeah! we have advanced in terms of making action/sci-fi movie",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America).",
    "reviewBody": "Before the Avengers assembled weve had 2 Iron Man, 2 Hulk, 1 Thor  1 Captain America movies. Black Widow was seen in\nIron Man 2 and Hawk Eye makes a first time appearance in this one. If you do the math it is pretty clear that to get The\nAvengers right the director has to get Hulk and Iron Man right. Iron Man is safe in the good command of Robert Downey\nJr. but Hulk was the only character that never peaked in spite of two actors (Eric Bana  Edward Norton) trying to nail\nit in two different movies. For me the biggest triumph of The Avengers is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. He is\nthe best Hulk yet.Whats it about? For those who have not followed the series, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) brother of Thor\n(Chris Hemsworth) lands up on earth searching for a cube that will help him rule the earth. Nick Fury (Samuel L.\nJackson) has to stop him so he assembles Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Rufalo), Black Widow (Scarlett\nJohanson), Hawk Eye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to stop Loki. How is it?\nPaisa vasool entertainment.My Take Like I mentioned above Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk is the bestest part of\nthe movie. You have to be patient enough for The Hulk to appear. His entry is almost after an hour but Mark Ruffalo\nprepares the perfect build up as Bruce Banner with his restrained and almost vulnerable portrayal of a character\nstruggling with his condition. The second best thing is the humor. Joss Whedon gives all the characters some really\nwitty lines to deliver. Since most part is about the Avengers coming together the humor helps in keeping the audience\nengaged especially those who are not well versed with the back stories of each individual superhero. Out of the all the\nsuperheroes I was only interested in Robert Downey Jr and Mark Rufalo. The rest were great supporting actors at their\nbest. The icing on the cake is the last 30 mins when the film peaks as a special effects loaded summer blockbuster\nmovie. If you look at director Joss Whedons filmography youll wonder what made the studios trust him with a rumored 220\nmillion dollar budget film. Now, that is the story I am very interested in knowing! He is the only guy I know who has\ntaken a giant leap from T.V to the big screen. Word of mouth The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron\nMan) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America). Rating - **** (Very\nGood) Ticket Meter Worth any amount of moneyP.S. If you have it playing in an Imax theatre drop everything and make an\neffort to watch it there. The fun just multiplies with the Imax experience.",

    "reviewBody": "Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in\nlegendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last\ncentury, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the\npeople who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying\nsuit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the\nnames Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk.\nComics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They werent like the comics, took\nthemselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous\nheroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made. The story itself\nis about heroes with flaws, who need to grow together as a team so they can save the world from a mighty attack from\nother world. If you like stories of heroes and strange folks you should go see this movie. Its not perfect, but very\nclose being perfect.",

    "reviewTitle": "Loki for an Academy Award please",
    "reviewBody": "I read a few of the other reviews, and while some mention the incredible performance Loki gives, none capture the true\nbrilliance. I expect Tom Hidelston to win an Academy Award for his role in this story. Loki is not evil. Not purely\nsickeningly evil. Heath Ledger takes top honors for that portrayal as the Joker. Loki is different. He has goals,\nmotives, desires, and pride. He is above all else mischievous, cunning, and calculating, as he attempts to and\ntemporarily succeeds in turning the worlds greatest heroes against each other. He truly delivers one of if not the best\nperformance of the movie, and in particular shines a little after an hour into the movie, when Black Widow confronts him\non the carrier: \"Your ledger is dripping, its gushing red, and you think saving a man no less virtuous than yourself\nwill change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer\" pathetic. You lie and kill in the\nservice of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the\nhorrors; but they are a part of you, and they will never go away. \" All other main characters give stellar performances\nas well. The Samuel Jackson (an actor I usually despise) brings back all the greatness of Pulp Fiction, except this time\nbald and with an eye patch. Captain America dominates every moral issue, and though one of the weakest of the team, is\nthe greatest unifier and leader among them. Thor brings back the elegance and civility of a bygone age, combining with\nIron Mans sarcasm and cocky swagger in just the right ways to leave everyone grinning. And Bruce Banner finally gets a\nchance to shine as a brilliant yet conflicted man more than as a raging green beast. Even Black Widow and Agent Caulson\nhave their moments. The only slightly disappointing acting was by Hawkeye, but most of the time hes not fighting, hes\nbrainwashed, so you expect him to be acting a little strangely anyways. And the ACTION. Incredible. Once the final\nbattle starts, there is no letting up. It is brilliant flash after brilliant flash, punch by punch, hit by deafening,\nglorious, hit. It never lets up, and it is almost impossible not to cry out in excitement. I felt like a little kid all\nover again. Each team member gets their cameo time fighting off hordes against all odds, and then comes scene after\nscene of team work. At one point, you follow Iron Man as he blazes a trail, literally, through the oncoming horde,\npausing briefly to help each hero as he rushes by. Captain America leads the ground assault, Thor dominates the skies,\nand Hulk smashes with such agile speed and deadly efficiency you are left squirming in your seat. I am an action junkie,\nand while I found the opening salvos somewhat dull, especially the car chase, I loved every mini hero battle and almost\ncried in delight through out the finale. The only Marvell movie I think that stands up to The Avengers as best comic\nbased movie is Woverine: Origins. While Avengers did have better and more exciting action, including the finale, Origins\nhad a more heart wrenching and slightly better told story. The end of Origins, when Wolverines love dies in his arms, I\nhave a hard time not choking up. That gut wrenching, heart tearing, happy-and-dying-inside-all-at-the-same-time feeling,\nthat make movies like Spartacus and Romeo and Juliet so great, that helped make Origins great, never once came to me in\nAvengeres. For that reason, I think Avengers did not appeal to me as much as it could have. I just did not feel it\ninside like I have other stories. Overall, an excellent movie. It started a little slow for me, probably because I was\nso anxious to see the heroes fighting an alien army. And while I did find the movie very funny at times, I think the\ntrailer kind of ruined it for me: there were lines I remembered loving from the trailers that, in context, were much\nmore serious, and hearing all the laughing in the theater, even though they were lines I laughed at when I watched the\ntrailers, seemed somewhat inappropriate. I rarely give out 10 stars, but Im still riding the adrenaline from the\nfinale, even without which, Im not sure Id lower my score to a 9. Out of 100, this movie definitely scores somewhere\nin the 90s.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Marvel Film Yet.",
    "reviewBody": "Lets be honest. This could have been one of the biggest disasters in (short) history of Marvel film Studios. Too many\ncharacters, an untested (for blockbusters at least) director, a raft of egos, a film packed full of CGI effect heavy\naction... It could have been, shudder, another Transformers 2. Or worse even Transformers 3. And with any other studio\nit probably would have been. Thank god then that Marvel have once again proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that when they\nbring their A game, few others can come close. Marvel have been on a rare run of form that has seen Iron Man, Thor,\nCaptain America and, too a lesser extent, Iron Man 2 all become both critical and commercial successes across the globe.\nIts fair to say then that The Avengers had some rather large shoes to fill. Well fear not as Marvel and Serenity\ndirector Whedon deliver what is probably their best film yet. The Avengers in short rocks. The story: After a familiar\nvillain returns from exile with an army of disposable bad guys in tow, Shield boss Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) has to\ndo the unthinkable... get a disparate bunch of superheroes to work together to protect the Earth from an seemingly\nunstoppable invasion. Queue the arrival of the cocky Iron Man, buff demi god Thor, man out of time Captain America and\nsometime hulk Bruce Banner along side Shield mainstays (and as yet without their own solo movies) Hawkeye  Black widow.\nYes the story is as simple as that. But in honesty the why is almost less important than the how... because Lokis\narmy never really feel like the insurmountable threat they are billed as and therefore the danger at the heart of the\nfilm just doesnt exist, but its Wheldons handling of his trademark character interplay (never more importantly\nmastered that it is here) that really makes The Avengers stand out from the crowd.See because if you didnt know (and if\nyou didnt know where the hell have you been over the past 10 years and what the heck have you been watching!), writer \ndirector Joss Whedon was the creator of TV gold such as Buffy, Firefly and Dollhouse (not to mention a host of rewrite\ncredits including films like Toy Story). He became renowned for his expertly drawn three dimensional characters,\nsparking writing and groundbreaking story ideas. So its no surprise that the character interplay is by far the\nstrongest part of The Avengers. In part that is because Wheldons script delivers - pathos, humor, dread. Often in the\nsame scene. That said if any part of this film would work it was always going to be the script. But it would be nothing\nwithout the top notch cast all delivering their A game. As usual Downey Jr shines as the ever humorous Tony Stark , but\nEvans, Hemsworth and Ruffalo all more than hold their own and, naturally, Sam Jackson could be cool reading from the\nphone booth. This film was always going to rely on the balance of these characters, potentially the films biggest\ndownfall. As it turns out, its actually The Avengers strongest asset. Even adding the yet only glimpsed at Hawkeye\n(Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) doesnt leave anyone short changed, finding enough space to make\nthese characters feel fully drawn. Watching The Avengers and seeing what Wheldon has achieved, I honestly doubt if there\nis a director in Hollywood today who could have managed to balance the ensemble cast as well as he does. Thats not to\nsay the action isnt good... far from it. Wheldon puts together some of the best action seen in a blockbuster for some\ntime. Well shot, expertly paced and best of all it isnt edited in that hyper kinetic super quick style that has plagued\naction films since Bourne  Bay hit he scene. But best of all because these are characters you care about, of actually\ncare about what happens in the action scenes. These arent faceless robots or badly drawn planks of wood, these feel\nlike real (albeit super powered). Whether its The Hulk smashing Thor through the bowls of the Shield super ship or Iron\nMan blowing bad guys out of the sky, the action is clear and often breathtaking. Villain duties fall to Thor bad guy\nLoki is there to provide the films big bad and is played with relish by the always brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Cocky,\narrogant and dangerous, Lokis interplay with Black Widow, Iron Man  Hulk lead to some of the films best (and often\nfunniest) moments. Does it have faults? Of course it does. The first hour takes a while to get going (mistakenly leading\nme to think I may not have been blown away by the film), Lokis army are a bit meh, lacking in reason or real threat\nwith their own power coming in numbers rather than skill and I would have liked to see a little more of Thor. But these\nare pretty small issues in what is for all-intense and purpose is one hell of an film. Oh and it would be remiss not to\nmention that, finally, after two previously flawed attempts someone has finally gotten The Hulk right. Less conflicted\nthen weve seen before, Ruffalo brings a likable but suitably dark edge to a Banner and when Hulk finally does smash he\ndoes so better than ever. So a great script, a superb cast, some of the best action we have seen on the big screen for\nsome time... The Avengers is probably one of the top 3 superhero/comic book movies ever made. All this from a filmmaker\nwho has been mostly ignored or abused by Hollywood for he past decade. In Joss we geeks have always trusted and now\nsecret is out. www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk",

    "reviewTitle": "Style.......lots of style, and when all the style is done, some more style",
    "reviewBody": "There is one word that sums up Avengers and that is style and it has awesome witty dialogues that are funny as\nhell.There was always this fear with Avengers that it would fail to give every character its due, but every single\nsuperhero gets time to do his thing, do it in style and look really cool doing it. The interplay between the characters\nis brilliant. There are lots witty dialogues and most of them range from being very funny to being downright hilarious\nand there are many scenes that had the audience laughing really hard. Without intending to give much away, there is one\nscene towards the end involving Hulk and Loki that may just be the funniest scene ever in the history of movies. Each\ncharacters gets his due, they play off each other brilliantly. Above all the movie when it decides to get the audience\nto laugh does a hell of a job.The story is one of weaknesses and it never immerses the audience in the movie and you\nalways feel that you are watching really cool stuff happening from a distance. The story, which is quite simple really,\ncan be summed up in two sentences. Loki has a deal with some aliens that if they help him take over the earth, he will\ngive them a blue cube sort of a thing, which is very powerful. Loki builds a gateway, something like the one between\nEarth and Asgard in Thor, and the aliens arrive and the Avengers beat them and Loki.Though Loki is the main villain, and\nhe does get nasty and clever at times, he is not who the heroes end up fighting in the final battle. A whole army pops\nout of the sky, (quite literally) and while all along you are told an army is coming, when it does arrive you sort of\nwonder who are they exactly. Consequently the army itself, which in this instance happen to be essentially aliens from\nanother of the nine worlds in the Thor story, seem very replaceable, and it would really not make a difference if the\narmy the Avengers end up fighting were huge giant robots. Essentially what the movie makers are telling us that now a\nbig army has arrived and the heroes have a hard task, and that isnt exactly great storytelling.Secondly given the way\nthis alien army is disposed off, by essentially shooting them with guns and arrows, you sort of wonder was this threat\nbig enough to require the Avengers, I mean the army or the navy would have taken care of it, really. In other words the\nthreat doesnt exactly overwhelm you when it arrives.My biggest problem with the story however is that when all the\nfighting is done there are no lasting impacts, I mean everyone walks off as if nothing happened and things are normal.\nThe kind of invasion that has just taken place would quite frankly be one of those world changing events, but not in the\nmovie, everyone just walks off as if nothing happened.In terms of performances there is not one performance which seems\nuncool, everyone has they fair share of funny lines to say and look really cool and do things in style. One set of\ndialogues sums up the final battle, and it goes like this:- Loki - I have an army Iron Man - We have Hulk.This in\nessence is the final battle for you. Hulk is good enough to wipe out the entire army, and really owns the final battle.\nHad it not been for the fact that the aliens were just too many in number and even Hulk is not someone who can be\neverywhere, the other heroes might not even be required. So to give the other heroes something to do there are enough\naliens to keep everyone busy and a nuclear bomb thrown into the mix. However dont let this give you the impression that\nthe movie is about Hulk, no its not, its about the others as much as it is about Hulk, just that Hulk is the biggest\nweapon the Avengers have against the alien army, and he pretty much owns every scene he is in. Some of the comedy\ninvolving Hulk is just awesome as well, and let me again remind you not to miss the Loki and Hulk Scene towards the\nend.So in short the focus of the movie is not on an in depth story, its purely about style. The Avengers is a great\nexample of how if you put enough style into a movie, the simplest of plots can provide tonnes of entertainment. I keep\nharping on the fact that Avengers is an \"entertainer\" meaning that if you want to have a good time you need to go this\nmovie, you will have a really very great time. The story has its flaws, but if you are out with friends and looking to\nhave fun, you wont exactly watch Schindlers List will you, you will go for something like Hangover. Avengers is\nawesome entertainer and right up there with the best of them and is a definite must watch.Lastly a lot of talk was on\nhow the Avengers will compare to the Dark Knight and really there is no scope for comparison. I mean trying to compare\nthe two movies is like trying to compare an Apple and a Television Set. I mean they are so different to each other that\na comparison is not possible. The only similarity is that they both have Superheroes in them, and that is where the\nsimilarity ends. They both are trying to be very different movies, and to try and compare them is futile.So go watch\nAvengers, you will have a great time.8/10 (only because I cannot rate it 8.5/10)",

    "reviewBody": "OK, Im going to have to start with the negatives about this film. Oh wait, there isnt any! In all seriousness, this\nfilm was incredible! I went to the cinema and watched it in 3D. I already knew that the film was going to be good by\nreading reviews and going on what my friends said it was like. A large group of us went to watch it and came out wanting\nto watch it again. There isnt a single scene in it that is boring or that drags. The acting is top class. You think\nthat watching a film with lots of superheroes is going to be cheesy or poor in acting performance. Not with this film.\nThe cheesiest thing about Avengers Assemble was Captain Americas suit and, to be honest, thats not even cheesy. The\ngraphics were outstanding, which is what you hope for when you realize the film cost $220 Million to make! Every time\nyou saw the Hulk smashing things up was incredible and not to mention the incredible scene where you see the Aircraft\nCarrier actually turn into and Aircraft! Overall, Avengers Assemble is an amazing watch, one of the films that youll\nwant to watch again and that you could say in the future I watched that film when It came out in the cinema. If you\nhavent seen it already, get to your nearest cinema and be as amazed as I was. If someone says the film wasnt very\ngood, I think its safe to say the have clearly no idea what there talking about! 10 Stars, absolute masterpiece, cant\nwait for a possible sequel (watch the credits guys, worth it).",

    "reviewTitle": "Entertaining popcorn flick it may be, but best superhero movie it is NOT!",
    "reviewBody": "INTRODUCTION After watching both Ironman movies, all Hulk movies, Thor and Captain America, watching Avengers is a\nsensible thing for me to do.WHATS HOT Great casts. Majority of them carry their parts well. Its nice to see all the\nfamiliar faces from previous movies.Great action scenes and impressive visual effects. The final New York scene is\nawesome. So many things to focus on, sensory overload! Ironman. On the field, Steve Rogers may be the unofficial leader\nof the team, but it is Tony Stark who performs most of the important, life-saving duties. The backbone of The\nAvengers.Scarlett Johansson and Cobie Smulders. Enuff said.WHATS NOT Loki. I understand that sometimes a couple of\njokes here and there can be good, but when some of the jokes come from the result of the main villain being stupid,\nweak, being thrashed around, thats not good. What makes a good superhero movie is, among other things, the villain. His\nor her on-screen presence should instill fear, uncertainties, and in some ways, respect.Alien soldiers. There is no\ndoubt that Ironman, Hulk, Thor and Capt America can kick aliens ass anytime anyday, but Black Widow? Come on... I\nunderstand that this is a comic book movie, therefore any logic should be thrown out of the window, but Black Widow\nbeating many alien soldiers without much difficulties is way too much. No doubt that she is a formidable fighter and can\novercome many human opponents as we have seen in Ironman 2, but to be on the front line during an alien invasion is a\nno-no. She is more suitable for espionage, covert, intel-gathering, kind of duties.Black Widow. Same as above.Familiar\nstory lines. Using a space portal to send alien soldiers and ships to attack earth? We have seen that in Transformers :\nDark of The Moon. Huge alien attack craft that looks like fish? Also seen that in the same Transformers! Destroying\nalien mothership using a nuclear warhead? Seen that in Independence Day.Police / Army. I know this movie is about a team\nof superheroes saving our world from alien invasion, but the apparent lack of support from the police and armies in\nfighting the aliens is so glaring. The freedom of 6 billion people under threat and yet you rely on less than 10\npersons? The results are our heroes performing less important tasks such as saving civilians cornered by weak and easily\ndefeatable alien soldiers (as evidenced by Black Widow) in a bank and rescuing people trapped in a bus! Delegate those\nthings to the police, firemen, or ground troops, and focus on the bigger task of defeating Loki and closing the space\nportal.CONCLUSIONAn enjoyable movie. I had a good laugh on some of the scenes, mostly involving Hulk. In my opinion, The\nDark Knight is still the best comic book movie, and maybe the title will go to The Dark Knight Rises in 2 months time.",

    "reviewBody": "The best superhero movie ever. Its entertaining, fresh, humorous and clever. All the superheros who appear in the film\nare fantastic, they are all included in the film equally so you dont really get the sense of a main character which is\ngood.Captain America was awesome, he takes leadership of the team during the end fight scene which is really cool, we\nsee him really kick some ass in this film but I felt his costume looked a little rubbish compared to his original\ncostume in Captain America.Thor didnt fail to impress, his costume was awesome but would of liked to of seen him wear\nhis helmet in both the avengers and his own film like he does in the comics. His fight scene with Hulk was crazy, so\ngood!!! Iron Man was awesome, he provided witty sarcasm that lightened the mood, he had some incredible action scenes\nand the special effects of his costume attaching itself to him in mid air was incredible.I didnt think after watching\nthe film that the Hulk would be my favorite character but he was, the film really changed when the Hulk was unleashed,\nhe was destructive and powerful and was a force to be reckoned with in the film. The fight scene between him and Loki\nwas hilarious! (well if you call it fighting, it was more like hulk playing with a toy) Black Widow was wicked, had some\nbad ass fighting moves which contributed to the film massively. And she was super hot! And had some kick ass fight\nscenes.I didnt really think the movie needed Hawkeye but I was wrong, he was a really cool addition to the film and\nfeatured in the storyline massively and had some awesome action scenes at the end. I didnt think there was ever going\nto be a superhero movie which rivaled that of The Dark Knight but there is and its called Avengers Assemble!!!!!",

I really recommend this film not just to people who like\nthis type of film but anyone who enjoys all type of film. Its awesome, just are black widow in that suit!! All of the\ncharacters get great screen time, and all of them feel in place, no one is left out and the character development is\nsomething to congratulate Whedon on. This film has everything in it, and I was so surprised by the humour because it\nwasnt cheesy, it was well done and clever, I look forward to the sequel! I do however feel sorry for Nolan, for his\nfilm should be overshadowed by this film, in fact all films this year should be. I might just go see it again. All of\nyou should, such an achievement, credit Joss Whedon...bravo. And now that I have put spoilers, just wanna say, Hulk Vs\nLoki was one of the greatest scenes ever.

    "reviewTitle": "Stunningly Intense, Emotional, Likable and Funny!",
    "reviewBody": "Saw it yesterday with my nephews and niece and enjoyed it more than any other Marvel adaptation since Spiderman.I cant\nthink of any other recent film that could make this granite-faced 39 year old crack a grin at its moments of\nold-fashioned super-heroic \"awesome!\", such as when Captain America intervenes at the last moment to save a brave\ncivilian from being vapourised, or simply watching a succession of childhood heroes duke it out with many a \"THOOM!\" and\na \"WHAM!\" Yes, this film taps into our need for larger than life heroes, while at the same time making them likable by\nallowing us to laugh at them: Captain America is super-strong, brave and handsome, but probably wouldnt know how to use\na computer mouse. Thor, aka \"PointBreak\", wears his mothers drapes. The Hulk is a dangerously powerful toddler in torn\nshorts.I even preferred Tony Stark in this one than his own films: somehow his wisecracking arrogance is much more\nimpressive when its at the expense of demi-gods and superhumans! With the tactical prowess of Captain A., the director\nhas managed to get each character to play an equal part in their own special way, while providing a lot of fun and\ninterest in the way they interact, whether theyre cooperating or otherwise.When a films heroes are near invincible it\ncan be hard to induce a sense of jeopardy, but this film succeeds in doing that by providing an unexpected event which\nalso lends a strong emotional core. We are also shown that our heroes can bleed: in 2 effective moments I remember there\nis a pause, we see that a hero is badly injured, but he carries on without complaint.Such is the goodwill fostered by\nthe film, Im prepared to skim over the negatives. Id have preferred the gathering of the team to be hastened on a bit,\nand I think one stunt pulled by the Black Widow seemed more believably suited to a super-powered being, which was\nunnecessary as her more \"down to earth\" abilities were already enough to prove that she was a valuable part of the\nteam.After we emerged from the cinema, we were all still pretty stunned from the intensity of the action. The verdict of\nmy companions? The film rendered the life of my 15 year old nephew complete; his 11 year old brother thought it was\n\"OK\", and my 7 year old niece was inspired to switch her favourite character from Thor to The Hulk.",

    "reviewTitle": "Surpasses \"Begins\" in every aspect!!!",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolans second bundle of joy \"The Dark Knight\" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of\n2005s reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a\ndeeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times\nthroughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite\nreluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the\nmurder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane)\ngrounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batmans\nmost deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman89 he is CHILDS\nPLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the\nprevious incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the\noriginal  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked\nKatie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype\n(though theres a little of it, THANKFULLY) thats common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this\ntime around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone\ncrushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batmans disposal.  Also worth mentioning is\nscreenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark\nKnight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I\napplaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and\nall those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolans talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of\nmelancholy over Ledgers death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and\nhonor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter\nMatilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember .\n. . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in\npeace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.",

This is the first time I can remember where a summer\nblockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, its the acting that makes it a\ngreat piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have\ntheir moments.Bales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film.\nMartial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve\nLuscious Foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for\nHeath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for\nthe writing and treatment of the character. Its not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the\nNolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Jokers stance on chaos, order,\nanarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans\ndrafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. Thats how difficult\nof a role this was, and thats why Ledgers performance is so great.This isnt an action movie. Its a film that\nexplores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because its\nall in there.",

From the Killing Joke \"Sometimes I\nremember it one way, sometimes another... if Im going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\" He wails on\nBats in one scene with cane and knife, using the strength of a madman, contrasting sharply with Batman showing restraint\njust when you really think he might lose it.The development of Two-Face played out well, showing his transition from\nstrong public leader Dent to the duality driven, obsessive Two-Face, raging against free will. Im proud to report he\ndidnt rob the 2nd Gotham Bank at 2pm on the 2nd of February.Batman/Bruce give us what we expect from where Batman\nBegins leaves him; as a very very busy vigilante. It is nice how little change he goes through as Bruce, against how\ndetached he must become, and how far he must fall as the Batman.Other than that, cool gadgetry from Wayne RD of course,\nalmost all of it believable. Sonic suit, cell phone hacking- a glimpse of ORACLE? wait till you see the bat-bike show up\n--- (eruption of cheers)Hardly any confusing effects, stunts or fights. Well choreographed and executed.",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman at his best and beyond",
    "reviewBody": "Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no\npowers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant\nJames Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham\nCity. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham.\nBatmans struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and to\nimprove his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was\nredesigned) to stop the madmans campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops\nbetween Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the\nbest out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the\nadventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is\nvery haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and\nriveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for\nbest supporting-actor. It is a shame that he cant see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent\nwhich is made so dark  sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels dont turn out to be better\nthan the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I\nalso really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol  Batman is standing in front of it.\nChristopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasnt made 10\nmovies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make\nthe audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit  vegetables on the screen.",

There were several shots in the film that had me saying \"Now how in the hell did they do that?!\", Brilliant\nscores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I dont want to say\nmuch about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding its release, but its\nthere for a reason. Top Notch film.

    "reviewBody": "for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that\nheath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just\ngot home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really\ndo think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top\nshelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the\ntrailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the\nback....this is not the case. the film overall doesnt follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what\nmakes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers\njoker was good but i didnt think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jacks joker....actually i think\nits better but i dont think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and\npops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckharts two face/dent makes tommy lees a joke....but really\naaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a\nextra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in\nbegins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it,\nand its not like he doesnt have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im\nnot saying she did a bad job i just think with homes work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice\nif they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did\nin the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far\nthe best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv\nand D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",

    "reviewTitle": "This Movie Can Only Be Described With One Word.",
    "reviewBody": "And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like \"awesome\" and \"fantastic\" are thrown around way too\nmuch. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the\nplot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not\nin the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in\nalmost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesnt compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about\nthe run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didnt think any of\nit was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie\nhad to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than\nthe battle against good and evil.The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is\nmade for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel\nDawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really\nask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played\nreally well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath\nLedger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was\nperfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him\nthe Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He\nwas The Joker. May he rest in peace.I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of\nGotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I\nguess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the\nblue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed\ncheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of\nthe best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the\nback of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker\nbe what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though Im\nan Aussie, and dont have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I\nthought The Jokers makeup was really cool, because it didnt just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout\nthe movie. They went into detail with it. Batmans new suit was also pretty cool.I guess in the end, all I can really\nsay that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan\nreally came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a\nfranchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think\npeople could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is\nat a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman\nmovie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible.",

    "reviewTitle": "If you only see one movie this summer yada yada yada...",
    "reviewBody": "Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: \"If you only see one movie\nthis summer, this is it\". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark\nKnight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released\nall year. Period.I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this\nmovie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first\nIMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were\nflying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie?\nWell, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well.\nSince Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this\nmovie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was\nHeath Ledgers part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can\nagree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a\njoker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard\nto tackle.Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene\nunnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that\nperfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get.\nI also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie\nHolmes wouldnt be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined\nher character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just\nabout perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said forget the rest. This is\ntop notch... I want to watch it again.",

    "reviewTitle": "Is this is a Comic Book Movie?",
    "reviewBody": "Let me preface this comment by saying Im not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy\nthe genre if its done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight\nReturns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a \"comic-book\". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot\nof comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. Theres a certain level of cheese and immaturity\nassociated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime.However, the question\nthat kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was \"Is this really a comic-book movie?\" And I think\nthats no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to\nspring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when its night, its dark and\nwhen its day its light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and\nsupervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the\naction is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing thats really \"comic-book\" about the movie is Batmans costume,\nwhich is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. Its all tied together with a\nrock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so\nintense I think it gave me heart palpitations).Certainly a risky move to pull in a film thats appealing to an audience\nthat is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more\ncredit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me.What Im trying to say is this movie is good.\nIts so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of \"comic-book\" movie.",

With unprecedented hype and speculation, the latest Batman adaption has created the loftiest expectations for\nmillions of people (fanboys and moviegoers alike); myself included.After seeing an advanced screening of The Dark\nKnight, I can honestly say: The Dark Knight is amazing.The Dark Knight left me breathless. The Dark Knight is the\nbest Batman movie to date. Christopher Nolans latest film, without a single doubt, dethrones Tim Burtons Batman and\nhis own Batman Begins. Its immense, unpredictable, and believable. Nolans The Dark Knight transcends the\n\"superhero\" genre.The IMAX format is absolutely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and go see The Dark Knight in IMAX if\navailable to you. There were moments during the picture where the IMAX-specific sequences left me speechless. It was\nunreal. It made the cinema-experience that much better (though Im nearly positive that IMAX or not, youll still love\nthis film!)The last thing Id like to mention is the wonderful acting in The Dark Knight; specifically Heath Ledger,\nAaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman. Their respective performances were uncanny. Ledgers portrayal of The Joker is\noutstanding and deserves the praise hes been receiving from many early reviews. Eckhart is excellent and showcases his\nmulti-talented abilities through the movie; I believe in Harvey Dent. Oldmans role as Jim Gordon was a personal\nfavorite of mine, and I left the theater in amazement. To avoid spoiling anything to you, I must admit to you that my\nreview is only scratching the surface. I loved this movie! Great work; Great film.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made",
    "reviewBody": "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolans follow up to\nthe critically acclaimed 2005 film \"Batman Begins,\" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes,\nyes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount\nof praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as\naction orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic\none sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The\nJoker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about).\nChristian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of\nwater with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and\ncriminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who\nfights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to\ngive the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bales tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is\njustified, and we emphasise with Bales flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent\nBatman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all\nwant know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledgers Joker is not only\nthe best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant;\nany synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batmans worst villain;\ncunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I\nhonestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the\nother actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for\nSmoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is\njustice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dents\nlove interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaals performance has substance, I really cared for\nher and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he\nprovides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly\nhumour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldmans Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a\nBest Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging\nsituations.Wally Pfisters cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide\nshots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another\nOscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score\nsets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the\nadrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a\ncomic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal.\nThrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible\nwithout Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest\nBatman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and\nsituations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and\nis the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time.\nThere are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most\ndark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for\nNolans flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.",
    "reviewBody": "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered\ncharacter. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of\nGotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps\nhis strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed\n(by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say its the deepest\nmainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker a bit eccentric.  While\nwatching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that its TOO long, and therefore\nboring. But thats not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which\nChristopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants\nto explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess Im saying is, considering\nwhat it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewers interest.  And thats\nnot to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly\nawesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  theres some great hand-to-hand\nstuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and\nquite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.\nChristian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George\nClooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word\ntortured keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  its pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Yknow, Id heard talk of an\nOscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what its come to?\nThen I thought, is it because he didnt get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?\nBut...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after\nseeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If youve seen it, you hopefully\nget what I mean. If you havent...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal.\nI didnt have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more\nemotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being\ninvolved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have\ndone a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But Im not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to\nsay my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my\nfavourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No\npsychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without\nresorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White!\nTiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. Its equal parts cerebral\nand visceral. Ideas and  action.  Ive liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman  Robin),  but this one\nmakes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.",

    "reviewTitle": "Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait",
    "reviewBody": "I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film.\nIt was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare\nthough, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins)\ndelivers on more than the Joker we remember from the Old Days of Burton and Nicholson. Instead were given a\npsychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledgers performance are grounded. Watching it\nwill make you feel a different chill down your spine than youd remember from any other film. Its impossible, quite\nliterally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at\nhis sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why youre laughing.If Ledger wasnt enough to horrify you - wait for\nHarvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gothams fallen White Knight and Batmans direct counterpart.\nHis transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones portrayal look like childrens breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect\nchemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batmans conscience and of\ncourse, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and\nBegins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the majestic but unfinished tones of Begins - but\nit suits the films tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in\nBegins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as\nmentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just\nfelt like a loose thread and wasnt quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasnt what I expected\n(others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasnt) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is\na film that is quite close, if it isnt already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous\nSuperhero adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isnt campiness creeping in. In face, if\nBatman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that couldve been\ngiven.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly wont regret it. One of the best movies of 2008\n(Ill wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for.\nIf you dont like it, then thats also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good\nmovie, so the rest of us wont take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Cant\nwait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!",

    "reviewBody": "Amazing. Usually when a movie is hyped this much its a bad omen. We all knew, following the tragic and untimely passing\nof Heath Ledger, that the buzz around this film would spiral beyond control... but I was pleasantly surprised (well,\nmaybe not too surprised) to find that the movie actually surpassed the hype. I went into the preview expecting a great\nmovie, but got even more than that. The opening sequence grabs you, the pace of the action keeps you moving along (even\nfor such a long movie), theres just enough (dark) humor mixed in to make the issues the characters face palatable and\nto make the characters more believable as human. I have just one very minor beef with this film- totally unrelated to\nplot or characters. Gotham, though fictional, has long been associated with a particular American city. I was kinda\nbummed to see the movie filmed in that Second city. Oh well. Still a great movie. I just watched in twice in a row, but\njust couldnt stay through a third screening. Not that its not worth it- I will definitely see it again, but its kinda\nlong and Im reeaallly tired, so, off the bed. Im sure you will love this film.",

    "reviewBody": "So here it is. The most hyped-up, talked about and acclaimed superhero movie in... well, ever. Was it worth the wait?\nYes Did it deserve the praise? Yes Did Heath Ledger surprise viewers who have had people nibbling in their ear about his\nportrayal for months now? Definitely yes. The film pretty much succeeds everything it sets out to do, and thats a lot.\nAn epic crime film that has the similar layered and extravagant plots of something like Inside Man, The Dark Knight is\nfar from a typical superhero film. There are psychological character studies of the Jokers anarchic destruction, Harvey\nDents shining savior and last but far from least Batmans role as the Dark Knight, the man who is above and below\neveryone else to do what they wont. The discussions in the film about who Batman is really defined what the character\nis all about and when the words The Dark Knight concluded the film I completely understood its meaning. This\nincarnation of Batman is also the darkest. While Burton opted for Gothic quality, Schumacher for colorful campyness,\nNolan has decided on a gritty and unsettling look at Batman. The story is unbelievably tragic and while I wont say much\nthe film has far from a happy ending. It may not be the most entertaining superhero flick out there but its certainly\nthe best.",

From Ledgers unrecognizable and amazing performance of the joker(he embodied the\ncharacter very well) to Christian Bale maintaining form from Begins. Maggie G was an excellent choice for Rachael and\ndid a far better job than Katie Holmes. Michael Caine as Alfred has great comic timing but knows how to play serious as\nwell.Cillian Murphys small role in the film was a good decision by Nolan. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey/Two face was intense,\nhe surpassed all expectations i had of his skill.Ledgers presence on screen is powerful and a little scary at times, but\nthe slightly morbid jokes of his are perfect. He almost overshadows the entire film because he is just so insane on\nscreen.My Favourite movie so far this year. RIP Ledger. Congratulations to Nolan for making such a fantastic movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Masterpiece",
    "reviewBody": "Set almost immediately after \"Begins\", The Dark Knight focuses on Batmans fight against the Joker, a criminal\nmastermind and mass murderer who is gathering all of Gothams criminals under his banner. With the body count piling up,\nBatman, along with his close allies Lucius Fox (Freeman), Detective Gordon (Oldman), Harvey Dent (Eckhart) and his\nfaithful butler Alfred (Caine), must bring the Joker to justice before he turns Gotham City inside out.This movie was\nperfect in almost every aspect. A solid script, great action sequences, suspense and well-portrayed characters, this\nmovie definitely surpasses all the hype.The action sequences in DK were brilliant. They kept you on the edge of your\nseat with suspense and excitement. I myself almost fell off my seat wondering if Batman really was going to kill the\nJoker or spare him.The movie, however, is not just a movie about a Superhero. There were parts in this movie that i\nfound interesting. Such as the scenes in which peoples lives were placed in the hands of others. These scenes really\nhelp to investigate the dark side of the human mind and in some aspects, brings out the joker in all of us. This made\nthis film more than just a Superhero film, but somewhat of a psychological thriller as well.The characters in this film\nwere very well-portrayed. Maggie Gyllenhalls depiction of Rachel Dawes was interesting and definitely different from\nKatie Holmes. She gave Dawes a stronger character in a way which was more suitable for this film as Rachel played a\nmuch bigger role. Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent. His performance was powerful and confident and portrayed\nGothams new hero as the kind of hero you would expect.However, best of all would be Heath Ledgers performance as the\nJoker. Ledgers portrayal of the Joker was creepy, disturbing and downright scary. It differed greatly from Jack\nNicholsons portrayal of the character, giving it the creepiness it needs to portray a psychotic mass murderer. He\nsimply captures every scene and has the ability to either make us laugh or make us cringe.Overall, this movie not only\nlives up to the hype, it surpasses it. The Dark Knight is hands-down, the best Batman movie ever and maybe even the best\ncomic-based film ever.",

    "reviewBody": "I have looked forward to this movie for about a year, and with it being my most anticipated movie ever, i was expecting\na roller coaster ride of emotion, chaos and anarchy... I got it all and more.Heath Ledgers performance is nothing short\nof brilliant. When hes on screen, hes amazing, and when hes off screen, you want him back. Thats how good he is in the\nfilm. I did however, think they could have had The Joker in the film a bit more.Christian Bale is very good as Batman,\nbut tries a bit too hard on the Bruce Wayne character. Maggie gyllenhaul is better than Katie Holmes period, although\nshe wasnt as involved in the crime fighting as Katie Holmes was.Aaron Eckhart was a perfect choice for Harvey Dent,\nand you could tell throughout the film that he had a dark side, especially when he had a few angry outbursts at Gordon\nand Batman.In conclusion, Ive never seen a film travel so fast, considering its a 2.5 hour movie. It fells like 1.5\nhours!! It is very well written with many memorable quotes..The highlights for me in the film were: The Jokers meeting\nwith the mob bosses, and for that split second when Gamble calls him crazy - Jokers reply is priceless!! The Bat Pod\nchase to the Joker was amazing, along with the hospital scene with a bit of dark comedy..Ledger carried this film, and\nwithout him, i wouldnt have the satisfaction i have now for this great film, SEE THIS FILM NOW!!",

The acting was poor, mediocre at best, (yes,\nthat is including Heath  Ledgers supposedly \"oscar-worthy\" performance as the Joker) the plot  was simply terrible and\namazingly uneven, as if no one had bothered to  make a final edit. It is one of the slowest and most boring movies I\nhave ever seen, I have never walked out of a movie before but I was  highly tempted with this mess, checking my watch\nevery few minutes  before the one hour mark in what ended up being a two and a half hour  movie that seemed oh so much\nlonger. I found that the best part of the  film was when the credits started rolling. Whilst Michael Bays  blockbuster\nmovies are terrible, at least they are somewhat  entertaining. Sadly, I cannot say the same for \"The Dark Knight.\"\nIgnore all the hype and dont be fooled by the trailers which suggest  this may be a good film - This movie was plain\nterrible, a complete  train wreck. 1/10",

    "reviewTitle": "The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted",
    "reviewBody": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what\nI saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated\nthat one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more\nwell-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is\nsolidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or\nwithout \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, its definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs\nout of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to\nthe feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and\nBruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember\nthat Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that\nserves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger,\nwho plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen.\nWhat really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. Its obvious that,\nto be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isnt easy. How exactly does one take him\ndown when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially,\nI was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful\nportrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones\nCOULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron\nEckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated\nseries.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts\ncant represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that\nweve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knights upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham Citys dark\nunderside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",

By far the best\nBatman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was\nwaiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor.\nThe character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heaths other films like 10 Things I\nHate About You and even Brokeback Mountain proves that this man could actually act, doesnt matter what character, he\ncould do it.The films storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each\nscene, making you wonder whats next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene\nwith Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome,\nthe story kept getting darker and darker, I guess thats why they called it the Dark Knight as well as the relation to\nBatman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played\nextremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had\nminor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes\nevil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more\naction this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Faces face in\nthe many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best\naction to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath\nLedgers life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan,\nespecially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. Its great!",

    "reviewTitle": "A Triumph of a crime film (not just a simple comic book movie)",
    "reviewBody": "I was just afforded the opportunity to watch the newest batman installment The Dark Knight but not only did i get to lay\nmy eyes upon a Nolan gift to the world, I saw it at 12.00pm and school was back in session.So without the constant\nramblings of minors or the reverberating sounds of popcorn crunching I was allowed to fully appreciate what had been put\nto the screen.To say i was elated with the finished result is an enormous understatement but it is also something that\ndoes not come on like a flood. Some scenes once begun can seem like a simply and brainless action flick as \"spiderman\"\nis asked to chose someones fate but the conclusion of each scene leaves you stunned as if you have just come to the\ntwist in fight club and no one has spoiled the ending.It does not take much thought to see that this is a good film, but\nsoon after the movie whilst you are sipping on your Mocha or catching the train home as I did, that you realise this is\na great film. Morals are questioned and lines are crossed and these are all beautifully created by the Nolan\nbrothers.They may not have the odd brilliance of the Coens or the VFX beauty of the Wachowskis but this brother duo are\nthe new force to be reckoned with in theatre. The title says crime film and I stand by that notion because what the\nNolans put to screen is not a comic-book PG blockbuster. Within minutes you feel like you are watching another crime\nthriller even though the protagonist is dressed in a black Kevlar suit and the antagonist dolled up like a two-dollar\nhooker.The action/story is fast-paced and the editing very edgy throughout fight scenes keeping that sense that we are\nall just blind as bats as he moves amongst us.And now onto the performances, Without doubt one of Ledger best characters\nand I know that the former statement is already echoing like a poor clich but it can be justified. It was not so much as\nwhat he said in the movie that evoked my endearment but what he left to his body. His jerky movements and twitches as\nhe almost seems uncomfortable in the trappings of his human body and then when he does open his mouth it amplifies\neverything that his body tells you. It is so easy to forget that this is in fact Heath Ledger, the man who sang to Julia\nStiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, he simply is not himself and you can feel just how much he put into his\nperformance because you truly believe that this man is mad.It goes unsaid that Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain both\ndominate in their particular roles especially in the case of Cain as he is given some wonderful dialog, which he\ndelivers with perfect tone absolutely stealing the scene from anyone he is accompanying.Bale again shows the world what\na real batman should be; torn, misguided, hopeful and terrifying but the one role that truly stood out in the film was\nthat of Gary Oldman. Long gone is the sympathetic innocence we saw of his character in Batman Begins, as he gives rise\nto a powerful Gordon and a character that really belongs in Nolans envisioning of Gotham. As i watched each scene with\nOldman I thought that i was watching the likes of Keitel or Spacey, he took every opportunity to prove himself as a\ngreat actor and in each scene he intimidates the audience with his power.The main factor behind the re-birth of the\nBatman franchise is believability, Gone are the glo-paint and mo-hawks as the Nolans give a haunting image of a world,\nour world, riddled with corruption in its darkest hours before the dawn.Without hesitation i give this movie 10 stars\nas it is beautifully shot, encouragingly directed, impressively written and memorably performed. This sets a new\nstandard for the comic-book movie, I wonder who can step up to the plate?",

    "reviewBody": "Im from Sydney, Australia. I have always been a big Batman fan. I had always planned to see this movie. I have to say\nthis movie was a masterpiece! All the acting was great! Especially from Heath Ledger! The script was well written. It\nwas very well directed. Action packed! The pacing was just fine. There wasnt too much talking and it never got boring.\nThe theater was packed as were the following hours. I wont give anything much away, but I will say that Scarecrow and\neven Two-Face were in this movie! And, yes, there are fight scenes with them in it. I give this movie a good 11/10.This\nwas Heath Ledgers last movie! It was a fantastic role by Ledger. His character and acting is very unforgettable. THE\nOscar WILL BE YOURS IN 2009, LEDGER! May his soul R.I.P.",

    "reviewTitle": "Its no definitive masterpiece but its damn close.",
    "reviewBody": "No words can quite aptly describe the dark, sinuous genius of Christopher Nolans \"The Dark Knight\". A sequel to the\n2005 \"Batman Begins\", the film defies the industry clich of being a shameless exploitation of a franchise. Much has\nalready been said about Heath Ledgers electric performance as the demented Joker and little else can really be said.\nIts a performance that displays every psychological tic with sadistic glee and Ledger, virtually unrecognisable behind\nboth the makeup and the mannerisms, imbues his character with terrifying insanity.Of course, Ledger is just one of the\nmany gems in a fine cast. Christian Bale is predictably good in the titular role but hes overshadowed by some other key\nplayers. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman but its Aaron Eckhart who gives a truly\namazing performance as Harvey Dent, Gothams idealistic DA and the citys moral centre. Eckharts innocuous golden boy\nlooks belie his dramatic finesse and he conveys the duality of Harveys character and ideals with great deft.The high\ncalibre of the cast is reason enough to go see the movie but its the screenplay, written by the Nolan Brothers, that\nallows \"The Dark Knight\" to become more than just an adequate sequel. For all the cartoonish connotations of its comic\nbook origins, the movie is a rich and fascinating study into the machinations of justice and humanity. In a genre of\nsuch formulaic conventions where \"doomed romance\" and \"final showdown\" are automatically entrenched in the storyline to\ninspire the same old message and emotions, its hard to find some new ground. \"The Dark Knight\" succeeds, however, in\ntoying with these very conventions and while the message that it sends is as subtle as an anvil crashing on your head,\nits surprisingly powerful. Say what you will about the hype and about the free publicity that Ledgers death has earned\nthis film but to credit its commercial or critical success so cynically would do both the actor and this film an\ninjustice. At the end of the day, \"The Dark Knight\" is brilliant entertainment with some phenomenal performances.Its no\ndefinitive masterpiece but its damn close.",

    "reviewTitle": "Very good",
    "reviewBody": "I was looking forward to this, Im a fan of comic book movies and I like when they delve into the psyche of the hero,\naka Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins, and this didnt disappoint. I actually had trouble remembering this was a comic book\nmovie. It gets very in-depth and doesnt pull any punches. Action, storyline, effects, mood, everything is very well\ndone, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, waiting to see whats gonna happen next. Normally I have\ntrouble sitting through a film thats more than 2 hours long but I was sorry when this finished.Ive been a fan of\nHeaths since Two Hands and his tragically cut-short development as an actor since then definitely shines through in\nthis. You can tell he put his heart and soul into this and while his death certainly adds to the hype theres no doubt\nhe does amazingly well with a very disturbed Joker. His performance is pretty much flawless and his presence on screen\nis palpable. The voice, mannerisms and just his general menacing aura definitely hit the mark and will do his memory\njustice for years to come. Its a pity he wont get the chance to reprise his role but Im glad he went out on such a\nhigh note. Baille is excellent but almost takes a second fiddle in this film, dont get me wrong its still very much\nabout Batman but the other characters are so developed and well done. Eckhart is great, Caine and Freeman are always\ngood and Maggie Gyllenhaal does her job well. Gary Oldman is one of my favourites, he is one of those actors that can\npretty much assimilate into any role and this is no different. Id say aside from Heath hes the best thing about this\nfilm in terms of acting, his naturalness and talent are apparent every time hes on screen.Hats off to Nolan, hes done\na great job (again). After the incredible disappointment of Indiana Jones, Im happy to say this is the best film Ive\nseen so far this year.",

    "reviewTitle": "While not the greatest movie ever made, its still an enthralling experience.",
    "reviewBody": "A lot of people here on IMDb are going to be rating this film 10 out of 10 claiming that it is the best film ever in the\nhistory of cinema. While the film is not _that_ good, it is still a great experience that manages to keep the audience\nimmersed in its unpredictable story line and tight action sequences.The Dark Knight, the first Batman film not to have\n\"Batman\" in the title, takes place after the events of the last film \"Batman Begins\". Crime in the city has fallen\ndrastically ever since Batman (Christian Bale) started roaming the streets and made the police pull their act together,\nbut this progress starts to become undone when an insane anarchist dubbing himself \"The Joker\" (Heath Ledger) comes into\nthe scene. What follows is a tight story control vs. chaos as Batman and the Jokers ideals clash in increasingly violent\nways. The plot veers and turns as The Joker and his crew continuously create increasingly dangerous diabolical\ncomplicated schemes for Batman and the police to thwart, and all the while the film constantly strives for realism by\ntrying to make the events that take place as plausible as possible, and is delivered with utterly seriousness dark\nattitude more along the lines of a good crime drama than a stereotypical superhero movie.Since Batman and the other\ncharacters from the previous film are largely the same as they were last time around, Ill get to the man we all came to\nsee: The Joker. While Heath Ledgers Joker doesnt top Jack Nicholsons from Batman 89 (because lets face it, who ever\ncould?), Ledger does provide an immensely interesting take on the character. It is probably not fair to compare the two\nactors seeing as they both do completely different approaches to the character; where Nicholsons Joker was an\negotistical, narcissistic psychopath, Ledgers Joker is a schizophrenic, sadistic anarchist. And believe me, The Joker\nin this film really does play off the anarchist factor. Here we have a man who wants nothing else but to see the world\ncollapse, and the only reason he wants it is just for the very reason of seeing the world collapse. He is jumpy,\ntwitchy, intimidating, and gives off the vibe that he could flip out at any moment for the smallest reason, or even no\nreason. He spends the whole film scaring, bullying and murdering people, just because it somehow makes sense in his\ntwisted mind, and he feels no fear, remorse or guilt whenever Batman or anyone else tries to \"punish\" him. Hes just\ndangerous, truly the Batmans arch nemesis; Batman hates everything about him, and the Joker loves making Batman hate\nhim.District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the other big newcomer to the story, and while anybody who knows\nanything about his character from the previous installments in the Batman franchise already knows his end, he is\nprobably the most well rounded and three dimensional character in the film. You can really get to feel his motivations,\nand seeing his rise and fall from power is really interesting.And for the more superficial out there, I will say the\naction scenes in the film are wonderfully choreographed, and the use of stunt men and practical effects over computer\ngenerated ones the majority of the time really does make for some exciting fight scenes.The film is not without flaws\nthough, the two biggest that come to mind are the films fast pace and ending. Granted, the film is nearly three hours\nlong, but it still feel like the creators tired to tell too much story in too little time. If someone walked in 5\nminutes late for this film, they would have already missed about 50 plot points. Granted that is an exaggeration, but\nits still true that the movie constantly jumps between set piece and set piece, skimming along to the next action\nscene, where it would have been nice to spend a few minutes here or there get to know characters better and establish\nmood. This isnt to say the movie doesnt spend time doing this at all, no, but it still would have been beneficial to\npad out the movie a little more. This fact becomes apparent with the ending. Without giving away anything, I will say\nthe ending of the film, while still satisfying, does sneak up out of nowhere and abruptly bring the film to an end,\nleaving you saying, \"Uhh... Dont you have a little bit more you want to show us?\".That and Batmans voice does get a\nlittle try hard.So while many will get wrapped up in the hype that surrounds the film and prematurely denote this films\nthe \"Best Movie Ever Made In The Universe\" award where it probably does not deserve it, the movie does manage to deliver\nto an audience member looking for a fun experience and tight storytelling. Its not a masterpiece, but it is a great\nmovie.",

After downloading and\nwatching the HD teaser (opening 5 minutes of the film) off of Demonoid I knew I had to go see it. Who ever said file\nsharing hurt Hollywood in the box office sales? Pfft.Im sure this film would still be as exciting on a regular cinema\nscreen but like someone else said: if youve got the choice go see it at IMAX. Some of the aerial cinematography really\nblew me away in all its full high-def glory.Earlier, I was reading a review where the critic was saying the film was\nslow to start but thats a load of BS in my opinion. I reckon it started at about 7 on the adrenalin gauge and cranked\nit up from there. All the performances were surprisingly authentic for a big budget Hollywood film. Heath Ledger WAS the\nJoker...no wonder he was disturbed by taking on such a psychologically deranged character.Anyhow, fans of the series\nwill be able to comment more authoritatively on how well the movie does justice to the Batman saga. Im simply writing\nthis from the perspective of someone who enjoys seeing an action film from time to time, and no doubt - The Dark Knight\ndelivers. Word!",

    "reviewBody": "Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema, and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you That was the coolest\nflipping movie I ever saw!The Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece. It builds itself up so many times, only to turn\naround and take you in another direction. Heath Ledgers much hyped performance lived up to all expectations, being both\nchilling, yet horrifyingly captivating. Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in\nthe world, and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final\nperformance, and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with. The only minor qualm that I may have with this\nfilm is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the films star. Christian Bale had noticeably\nless screen time than Ledger, why this is, I am not sure. The performance of the cast is, as you would expect from the\nstunning ensemble cast is remarkable. Old hands Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and\ngrace to the screen, while the new kids on the block (Gyllenhaal, Bale, and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart) truly knock\nit out of the park.If you miss out on this film, you truly are missing out, it is a modern classic.

    "reviewTitle": "A masterpiece - Likely to constitute a serious indictment on the Oscar system...",
    "reviewBody": "First things first.This film is not a comic book movie. It is not an action movie. To reduce it to these archetypes\nwould be completely unfair.To fairly represent this movie it must be seen for what it is - It is a dramatic suspense\nfilm that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the surprisingly long running time (surprising in that it goes by\nso fast, and also that the studio allowed Christoper Nolan to cut it this long) Batman Begins was seen by most to be a\ntriumph in the comic adaptation genre. However, it did remain a comic adaptation in many ways.The Dark Knight goes\nbeyond that. This film blows suspense up to a city-wide level, and raises the stakes to a breathtaking level. It recalls\nthe suspenseful nature of films by the likes of David Fincher, Ridley Scott, and even the master, Alfred Hitchcock.Its\ncrafted in such a way that each action seems both inevitable and unbelievable, and so even for fans of the comic book\nwho believe they know where it is going, it is an astounding achievement.The film looks spectacular, thanks to Nolans\nregular cinematographer Wally Pfister. Gotham city looks brighter, yet more ominous during the day, and danker and more\ndangerous at night.The performances are as spectacular as many had expected and/or hoped. Bale returns in fine form as\nthe titular character, and cant be faulted too much. Eckhart debuts as District Attorney Harvey Dent, and the storyline\neffectively revolves around him and his war on organised crime in Gotham. There are fine supporting performances from\nthe returning Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, as well as the newcomers Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell and\nMaggie Gyllenhaal (who thankfully takes over from Katie Holmes as Bruce Waynes childhood friend Rachel Dawes).However,\nif the action centres on Harvey Dent, then the action IS Heath Ledgers performance as the maniacal Joker. In one of the\nfinest film performances of the last decade, Ledger puts in what will end up being an unforgettable final (complete)\nperformance that will have almost everyone buzzing about a potential posthumous Academy Award.I cannot reiterate enough\n- Not only is this film excellent, and highly enjoyable to watch, but it is of such a fine quality that it should really\ntranscend the typical box created for films that are deemed to not contain the correct \"subject matter\". Much in the way\nRocky transcended the typical \"sports movie\", so this transcends the typical \"comic book movie\" - It is much more than\nthat, and should legitimately be considered come Oscar season. If this movie cannot earn some consideration by the\nAcademy, they might as well come out and call them the Academy Awards for slow-paced, moody dramas, because this is the\nbest film I have seen in a long time, and thats including the crop that were nominated for best picture last year.In\nshort, go see this movie. If you, or your friends, or anyone you know has been excited about this movie to come out,\nthen just know that everything that they were excited for is justified.Go see it - Youll enjoy it, because its\nterrific. Theres not much more to say.",

The photography is gritty, and dark and lit with cold\nlighting. But its effective. Speaking of awards, Heath Ledger deserves an Academy Award for his re-invention of The\nJoker. Its really tragic that he wont be around to enjoy the fruits of his labor. This movie will propel him to cult\nstatus. His Joker is demented. Twisted. Outright evil. I loved how he made a pencil disappear in his introduction scene.\nYoull understand when you see it. And youll love the stories he comes up with on \"how he got those scars.\" Another\naward should be given for the \"makeup\" on Two Face. Although it isnt makeup, its the most horrific and haunting face\nyou will ever see. Very ghastly, yet again, very effective. The movie does an amazing job of telling of his downward\nspiral. It is long, at 2 hours and 30 minutes, but it does leave you wanting more. (in a good way). Its really two\nmovies in one. At one point when you think things are winding down to a finale, its just getting warmed up. And when it\nis finally over, it isnt. There WILL be a sequel. And Im in line already to see it.",

    "reviewBody": "I am a batman fan. Not a fanboy mind you, I have read the comics, seen the other films, and like batman story well\nenough, but unlike a few of my friends, I havent been following the release for this movie like a bloodhound. But\nthanks to above mentioned friends, I have been passively looking forward to it. So we booked our tickets, got to one of\nthe first showings in the world (I live in Australia) and got ready to see a movie that could not possibly live up to\nthe hype that has engulfed the world. I was so wrong, so, so wrong. This film stands so far above its predecessor it is\non another planet. Nolans script is, like most of his movies, a complex and involving one. Unlike his some of his other\nfilms, the acting, story, cinematography etc all belong on the same pedestal. Never before have I felt the palm sweaty\nexcitement of a gripping film take hold of me for a complete running time (and keep in mind this is 2 and half hours).\nThe lack of CGI is one of the films biggest assets. The action feels gritty and real, involving you more than the\ngraphics heavy iron man or Hulk ever did.Id heard talk of Ledger being nominated for a posthumous Oscar but had thought\nit a silly move, why give awards to someone who cannot accept it? But his performance is mind blowing, creating one of\nthe best villains ever to grace the screen. I dont know if an Oscar is the right way to do it, but his performance\nneeds to be acknowledged for the masterpiece it is. Id heard a critic call this the \"empire strikes back\" of superhero\nfilms, and it really is the perfect comparison. This film proves that some \"superhero\" movies dont belong in a little\nniche, to be weighed against each other, not the \"serious\" films, but can instead be acclaimed as deep, involving and\nabove all exciting works of film-making.",

    "reviewBody": "As A Kiwi living in Aussie, I was skeptical about the level of sentimentality surrounding this film after the passing of\nHeath Ledger. I tried to go into the screening last night without having my expectations too high. I have to say\nthough... I was blown away. The reports say Ledger is brilliant and takes the Joker to a new level. They are absolutely\nright. This is a an intelligent, dark film, far removed from the neon colours and slanty buildings of the Burton-era\nfilms. This is certainly not a \"kids\" superhero movie, it deserves the M rating it received here. Its a\nthought-provoking and subtle the film explores the Dark Knight as a vigilante, not a hero. A force of good that needs\nthe opposite force of evil to exist. The scenes between Batman and the Joker are fantastic and riveting. The Scene\nstealing Jokers manic yet understandable musings are that of a new \"smater\" villain that doesnt rely on too many jokes\nor tricks take this to \"Great Films of All Time \" territory.a must see.",

    "reviewBody": "The most Amazing Batman Film Ever is here. Now this is a completely different batman then others, even though the cast\nwas the same. In Batman Begins the enemy turned out to be Bruce Waynes teacher. This movie however, there is a clear\nvillain and he is a complete psychopath. Heath Ledger has done something truly remarkable in the film industry: Giving a\ncharacter of Joker a completely different look and has put acting of villains to another platform. Rest in peace Heath.\nAlso all other actors were just as amazing. Christian Bale is of course awesome. Christopher Nolan, you are a legend!!!\nWhat a director!!!Now, be warned. This is a longer batman version. So be prepared to stay in a little longer than you\nexpect. But when everything said and done, The Dark Knight is an Oscar-worthy film and should be praised and will be\npraised for a very long time. I really hope there is another Batman movie after this one. I think Christopher will pull\nit off.",

    "reviewBody": "The leads in this movie shine and its an excellent balance of drama and action. It does stretch a little though, feeling\na little like theyve squeezed two films into one in order to give all the characters the room they need to develop\nuntil each one reaches their ultimate fate. An Australian reviewer recently commented it didnt feel that long despite\nbeing almost 3 hours long - guess what, it was only 2 hours and 20 minutes! Unfortunately, in Australia we tend to have\nto sit through half an hour of ads before the feature begins.I digress. Heath Ledger was excellent, channeling Jack\nLemmon on demonic form with just a hint of surfer dude still there, particularly when in one scene late in the film he\nreveals a tanned arm. The only negative I would give is this films hangover from the previous films in the series and\nthe persistence of Batmans booming graveling voice. Christian Bale must have had such a sore throat by the time they\nfinished making this film!",

    "reviewTitle": "A fantastic movie, truly a worthy successor to Batman Begins.",
    "reviewBody": "I went to see this movie with fairly high hopes that it was going to be a pearler. All the trailers looked good, the\npress were raving about Heaths portrayal of the Joker, and most of all it was a Batman movie. A character i had grown\nup with watching on TV. While this movie, like the previous title Batman Begins takes a big leap away from what everyone\nexcept the Batman comic book lovers have seen. It lands solidly on a firm ground made up of fans who are going to find\nthis movie an absolute joy.Christian Bale is back as the Batman and he works just as hard as he did in the last movie to\nbring that character to life. He plays Bruce Wayne down to a tea and his aggressiveness and ability to fight Shine\nthrough the big black suit. His voice, while some call it too strained and annoying as Batman I find fitted the role\nwell. This is not the Batman we are used to seeing. But I hope to see a lot more of it.Heaths acting in this movie is\nunlike anything i have ever seen before. Both he and Director Christopher Nolan have done an amazing job with the\ncharacter. Never has a character made me feel afraid, horrified, confused then had me laughing in hysterics all in the\nspace of 10 seconds. At times he truly is a horrifying figure to watch, then he switches to to a lunatic you cant help\nbut laugh at. They have managed to truly capture what the Joker really is in this movie. A dangerously insane human\nbeing.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/2 face. His performance was also excellent. You could sense the frustration within\nHarveys character in his fight to clean Gotham City of the mob families and the Joker. Yet there was such a change in\ncharacter once the transition from one to the other took place. And he did it superbly. I look forward to seeing this\ncharacter develop.Other notable performances were Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Eric Roberts as\nSalvatore Maroni and a small role by William Fichtner as the bank manager (But Im just a fan of whatever he does :) )\nOverall the film is a monster coming in at a runtime of 2 hours 32 minutes. But in no way do you feel it. The movie\nmanages to stay fresh and vibrant throughout. The action comes at you fast and intense and there is plenty of it. All in\nall this film will surpass any hype you have seen or heard about it. Its worthy of any awards it or its actors are\nnominated for.",

An epic of our time, The\nDark Knight is the best film of this year.I thought they might have glorified it just because of Heath Ledgers death\nbut it proved me wrong with a stunning performance from the entire cast. I was deeply impressed by what each actor\nbrought to the roles and they really make the characters breathe Batman.The depth of this film is larger than usual for\na Batman film with this movie breaking out of just another \"comic book movie\". It contains the dark and strong elements\nof Gotham City while still giving you the intricate detail of characters and this adds to the epic feeling of the film.A\nmust see for all movie lovers though I wouldnt take anyone under thirteen to see it as they would not fully appreciate\nthe depth and true understanding of human nature found in this film.",

Once we got passed the undercover cops\nwith night vision goggles and got to out seats The Dark Knight didnt disappoint... Well not too much anyway.With all\nthe hype about Heath Ledger was it as good as everyone talked about? Heaths performance was fantastic. He was creepy,\ninsane and the close ups was where he really shined. He had this quirk where he kept licking his lips. There is a\nwonderful part of the movie that will make you laugh and shudder at the same time. Well leave it as The Joker dressed\nas a woman.Personally I think his performance is up there with all the hype, but does he deserve an Oscar? Id say hed\nbe high up there. Unfortunately well never know if he deserves it on his acting ability or his death. This was his best\nperformance.Christian Bale, Gyllenhaal and Freeman all played there parts well, but they all just seemed like a fill in\nfor when the Joker wasnt on screen.Gary Oldman was great and Aaron Eckhart shone as Harvey Dent. I actually thought\nwed see him transform at the end and hed be used in the next movie. It was a nice surprise to see his alter ego come\nout. He did look like terminator though.The movie was fun, dark and I didnt expect it to end the way it did. I came out\na little disappointed that Id never see Heath again and also felt a little underdone with Christian Bale in the\nmovie.Heath simply steals the show as the joker youll be left wanting more.Sadly the movie as a whole almost felt like\na fill in for an even bigger sequel.",

Its really a lesson in storytelling, sharp and crisp dialog, story arcs,\ncamera direction... every aspect of film really.One thing that usually bothers me in movies (comic movies and otherwise)\nis the main characters need to have a romantic relationship just because. I even felt this way in Batman Begins. In this\nmovie however the triangle between Wayne, Dent and Dawes serves multiple purposes and helps to drive the film.This movie\ngrabs you from scene one, minute one and doesnt let go the entire time. It is a roller coaster ride better than any\nIve ridden on with huge drops and more twists and turns than youll be able to keep track of. Its not that theres a\nbig \"oh my god\" moment (alla sixth sense) but theres enough smaller scale twists to keep you readily engaged.Heaths\nperformance is as good as everyone is saying and the Joker in this film is far creepier than that in the original Batman\nfilm. What I dont think is talked about enough is Eckharts performance and Harvey Dent which is just spot on and\nextraordinarily powerful. It makes you hope that people like this exist in the world and you cant help but believe in\nhim as much as Rachel, Wayne and the Citizens of Gotham do.This is a movie you most certainly will want to see on the\nbig screen and youll want to see it as soon as possible. There are things in the movie that people could spoil for you\nand I guarantee you that people wont be able to not talk about this film, its just too good.The plot is not so much\nBatman vs. The Joker (all though there is plenty of that). Its really more about Batman against Batman. Does Gotham\nreally need him? Does he make things worse? Can he ever stop? Can he have a \"real\" relationship? Can he count on his\nfriends? Can Gotham survive without him? All of these things and more are answered in The Dark Knight.",

However, the Oscar nomination and possibly a win should go to Heath\nLedger who nailed the role as the Joker. He played the role so well that I felt so terrified that such a criminal could\nexist.

This is an extremely well-written film, with characters that pose\nsocial and psychological questions. It is also, in my opinion, the film with the best villain ever - The Joker. Even\nwith all the hype youve heard about this, I cant begin to describe how blown away I was by Heath Ledgers performance.\nThe cinematography couldnt have been better and it literally is a dark film. Hans Zimmers contribution to this film\nwas amazing. As always, he manages to create such unique music that perfectly fits this movie. Michael Cains\nperformance fits perfect within the movie. Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to see on screen and he always brings a\nbreath of fresh air to this intense film. Gary Oldmans talent needs no further praise, since he has proved on many\noccasions what a great actor he is.To be honest, I cant imagine why someone wouldnt like this film. If youre looking\nfor action, youre going to get it. If youre looking for great acting, it doesnt really get any better. If youre a\ncomic book fan, youll thank Christopher Nolan for showing you new things about you favorite character. And if youre\njust going to the movies, I repeat, this is a great script, this is storytelling at its best. The only reason why you\nmight not like this movie is if you got used to the highway chasing, car exploding, \"multi-talented\" - Michael Bay.\nActually, Dark Knight has chase scenes as well, but here, theyre part of the story, theyre not just there for the sake\nof blowing up some cars. Explosions, another well-explored matter by the \"great\" Michael Bay... Dark Knight has\nexplosions, hell, the one they shot in London got the locals calling the police to report a terrorist act. BUT the\ndifference is, Dark Knight is about story and character, the visual effects (which are mind blowing) are there to\nsupport this.I hope you all enjoy The Dark Knight as much as I did.",

    "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim\nGordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get\nrid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind\nknown as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Jokers plan is to terrify the citizens and throw\nthe city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own\nbeliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and\nvigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and\nMichael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledgers performance as the sadistic Joker was\nabsolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you\ndo, dont ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledgers performance has turned the\nJoker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good\nsinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce\nWayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself\nand Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie\nexplores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman\nthat to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it\nwent by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and\nhis BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I dont think parents should take young\nchildren. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)",

    "reviewBody": "Heath Ledgers edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his\ncostume is the right colours, but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like hes been dragged through\nthe filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars, smudged \ncracked white wash, blacken sharks eyes of death, capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks\nand tongue snakes, his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in\nsilent shock and awe. As fans, we wait to finally hear the Jokers maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a\nchilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His\nfacial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of\nchoice (not the lint or veg peeler) is the knife, for both its ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely\nbecause it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open\nbook for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark\nreminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a\nmasochistic punching bag for The Batman, Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into\nthe minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a\nworld without rules, where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the\ntransformation of Gothams White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent.The eerie background \"music\" is like a deaf tone\nbarbed-wire noise that rings through Gothams cityscapes as a harbinger of the Jokers evil to come.In all fairness\nLedger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burtons 80s film delivered a comic book to screen,\nthug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave thats stamped with Jacks vintage trademark. Ledger has\nredefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that wont let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen\nvillains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that\nLedger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers, namely Hopkins/Lecter, Spacey/Doe.This is a\ntour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype (rare thing) and even raises the bar (even rarer). So\nkudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember, the next time youre\nplaying a card game your hand may come up with the Jokers signature calling card. RIP HL.",

    "reviewTitle": "Excellent Sequel to Batman Begins",
    "reviewBody": "One things for sure: comic book based movies are here to stay. Once before they were B-movie, red headed stepchildren\nwith very miniscule budgets and low grade actors, now these films regularly attract A-list talent both in front and\nbehind the camera. The latest in this summer comic book slate is THE DARK KNIGHT, the sequel to the well received and\nawesomely successful Batman reboot BATMAN BEGINS and continues right where it left off.Where the first movie dealt with\nthe origins of how and why Batman came to be, this sequel now moves onto a larger canvas: the storyline now revolves\naround the consequences of Batmans appearance in a city gripped by crime and hopelessness. With the demise of former\nmob boss Carmine Falcones power in Gotham City, the various crime syndicates are now leaderless and trying to\nreconsolidate as Batman (Christian Bale) AKA billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne continues his relentless assault to restore\norder. In the first film director Chris Nolan portrayed Gotham as a sort of cross between the slums of Hong Kong and\nChicago of the Al Capone era with lots of rain and gloom, now Gotham is depicted as being very similar to New York, with\nmany massive high rises and somewhat sunnier skies, it seems Gotham is literally coming back to life.But even with new\nfearless district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart in his best role to date), it seems the city is just a few steps\nahead of the rising tide of criminality that is beginning to strike back against its newfound heroes and it manifests\nitself into a new and powerful adversary called the Joker (Heath Ledger in his final film role). I have always found\nthat the main differences between the main comic book makers Marvel and DC is in the portrayal of their heroes- whereas\nMarvel superheroes tend to be average guys and gals who are thrust with superpowers and lots of responsibility, DC\nsuperheroes tend to be iconic representations of the human condition: Superman is a depiction of the ideals and\ngreatness of mankind while Batman represents vigilantism and revenge. As the plot of the movie unfolds, the forces of\nlaw and order, represented by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman once again reprises his role and it has been expanded\nconsiderably) and Harvey Dent, battle it out on the streets of Gotham city against the forces of criminality with mob\nbosses Eric Roberts and Michael Jai White (yes, the SPAWN guy is here too) allied with chaos and anarchy which is\nrepresented by the Joker with Batman the vigilante smack dab in the middle of it all. Despite Batman being on the side\nof order, his very methods create a copycat gang of vigilantes who style themselves after him which puts the city even\ncloser to the brink. As all the swirling plot lines culminate into one big showdown, Batman must make his choices\ncarefully as every action he takes creates unintended and sometimes tragic consequences.The last great movie I saw since\nlast year was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN but I can say that THE DARK KNIGHT finally gives me a satisfaction that I had been\nmissing for over a year now. The acting is superb with many old faces returning- Morgan Freeman is homely as Lucius Fox\nwhile Oldman has a larger role and consequently gets to shine even further. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes is\nan infinitely better actress than her predecessor (though I thought Katie Holmes looked sexier even though she had zero\ntalent) but her role is somewhat subdued and we never got more into her character. Christian Bale is adequate for the\nrole of Batman/Bruce Wayne though he doesnt seem to put in anything new to the character (I still think Micheal Keaton\nwas the best movie Batman). The big question is obviously on Heath Ledger and he delivers a deliciously wicked and\nsadistic Joker- very similar to Jack Nicholsons take on the character and thats a compliment; my only peeve is that he\nwasnt given a permanent smile like the previous Jokers in the movie and comic book- slightly different take but still\nvery, very entertaining and fits in well with Nolans more realistic version of the venerable Bat franchise. It is sad\nthat Ledger will never be able to reprise his role and his makeup seems so similar to that of the equally late Brandon\nLee in THE CROW that the parallels are eerie. Unlike the past incarnations of the movie and cartoon Jokers, Ledgers\nperformance has transformed the Joker from a villain with a smile on his face into anarchy incarnate- he is no longer\njust a bad guy but a force of nature. The big surprise here is Aaron Eckharts portrayal of Harvey Dent- he steals every\nscene he is in and watching his fall from grace is like seeing that of an epic Shakespearean tragedy.Terrific action\nsequences and nail biting suspense adds to an epic sequel: 8 out of 10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Even darker than Batman Begins, though the Joker didnt die.",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolans approach for Batman again worked. Judging by my observation in a Bangkok cinema on July 17, it will\ndrain at least 150,000,000 both in US and worldwide. This is one of the main movies, if not THE main movie, of the year.\nBut its not your typical commercial comic hero for many reasons.1, Back in 2005, Batman begins was criticized to be too\ndark, as a Batman movie. If you still give points to those comments, you will definitely find the Dark Knight even\ndarker, maybe as twice dark as Begins. In the movie, there are virtually no sex, no explicit gore and even no swearing.\nBut there are two main traditional villains, both twisted and horrifying as much as any A-Class horror movie villain.\nThere are main characters died in most miserable circumstances, which made the audiences depressed. There is also a\ndarker conclusion for Batmans fate, and none of the above was presented in a moderate way. 2, Come along the dark\nmessages, is our dear Joker. We know the Joker didnt die; Heath Ledger died instead. There is still a rumor around\nsaying that, its the Joker, who dragged Ledger into a world of madness and didnt release him from the character,\nkilled Ledger. The rumor cant be justified, but the Joker does jump out of the screen. He threatens everyone on and off\nthe screen in a unusual manner, giving you a chill which makes Jack Nicholsons Joker look like a Disney joker. This is\na very daring performance indeed, but dangerous, for the parents may find their children approve the Joker for his logic\nand his value which work better in the \"real world\". It seems this Batman movie doesnt belong to Batman, but to the\nJoker, who essentially pushed the whole story forward and destroyed more than just human lives, but also their beliefs\nin Batman. 3, Batman doesnt own this movie. He is merely a narrator, a firefighter who desperately saves human lives\nfrom evil, while witnessing tragedies happening around. Once he want to be proactive, he drags himself into more\ntrouble. Consequently, friends have gone one by another.If we see any development on Batmans character, that should be\nhis loneliness.So, audiences may find Dark Knight a bit more difficult to swallow than Iron Man, Incredible Hulk,\nHellboy 2 and Hancock. Among all the blockbusters so far, it assumes more thinking and higher IQ from the audiences...\nHonestly speaking, I cant recommend this to everyone, especially NOT to children.I will recommend it to those who: 1,\nrequire a smart script and intelligent quotes. 2, willing to see creative action sequences and less CGIs. 3, not\nallergic to extreme violence and anarchism. 4, accept the realistic(sometimes pessimistic) messages from a superhero\nmovie. 5, at least 20 years old.Feel free to listen to some lighthearted musics after you see Dark Knight, if you need\nsomething to get rid of the mood.9/10 Almost excellent.",

    "reviewTitle": "Believe the hype",
    "reviewBody": "Before we begin, Id like to reveal something about myself. I am not a fan of Batman. That is not to say I dislike\nBatman, but I have never been especially driven to seek out adventures and merchandise pertaining to Gothams favourite\ncostumed watchdog. Prior to seeing Knight, the only two Batman movies I have seen in full are Batman and Robin and\nBatman Begins. Im not about to pass harsh judgment on either - I admit BR was quite amusing in a rather unintentional\nway and that Batman Begins was a well-crafted film (but I do not consider it to be a masterpiece in any way). At the\nvery least, it set the bar high for its successor, and rather high up at that.I know theres a thread floating around\nhere with the first five minutes of Knight in it. I never looked at it here, seeing it for the first time on an IMAX\nscreen. This opening scene alone - which follows a bank robbery, and that is all I shall say about it - gives a very\ngood indication of just how highly Knight sets its own bar. It burns its way into your head and lets you know that the\nnext two-and-a-half hours are going to be quite a step up from what you were probably expecting.Plot-wise, you should\nhave a fairly good idea whats going on. Theres Batman and theres the Joker and theres the usual kind of plot\ncomplications that dog the \"superhero sequel\", namely the whole act of strongly humanising the hero (just like all the\nother \"2\" movies). Im not about to deride Knight for its few clichd plot devices - show me a blockbuster sequel without\nthem. Its what the plot gets surrounded with that will truly impress you.First off, the acting. A serious sequel\ndemands very strong character development. Seeing as a lot of you are hardened moviegoers, you no doubt already know\nthat. Of course, Knight sticks to this \"rule\". But how it does is impressive. The cast is impressive. Aside from strong\nreturns from Caine, Oldman and Freeman, you have the introduction of a handful of new characters that will stick around\nin viewers memories longer than, say, the Scarecrow.Obviously, the first thing to come to mind is the Joker. Naturally\nI was wary of all the hype surrounding Heath Ledgers oh-so-epic final role. Could it really be as good as everybody was\nsaying? The answer is a loud and hearty YES. Ledger is quite simply a showstopper. He steals more scenes than the Joker\nsteals loot. His presence is simply commanding. Right from one of the earliest scenes (which I wont spoil with anything\nother than the phrase \"magic trick\") he takes hold and doesnt let go. Whether this talk of an Oscar is far-fetched or\nnot, I can honestly see a nomination happening. I kept thinking to myself, \"This is Ledger?\" And when an actor is\ncapable of doing that, well that is a good actor indeed. Now I can see how much of a tragedy his death truly is.The\nother character of note is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent (best known to fans for becoming Two-Face). Granted, Eckhart\ndoes not do as much show-stealing as Ledger, but his performance is carefully played and very convincing as he goes\nthrough a number of stages, from smooth and trusty to thinly veiled psychopathy. When his transformation into Two-Face\nis revealed, it is one hell of a shock (and a damned good effects job).Ironically, for a movie titled The Dark Knight,\nit seems like Christian Bale as the eponymous character is overshadowed by the aforementioned examples. Granted, this is\nbecause Bale is quite simply not a showboating kind of actor (at least in my experience), and that makes a fine contrast\nto the Jokers wild streak. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal doesnt really make that much of a better Rachel than Katie Holmes\ndid, but its a forgivable flaw in an otherwise brilliant spot of casting.Of course, being a summer blockbuster (or\nwinter, as the case may be), it just wouldnt be a superhero movie without a hefty helping of action sequences. The\naction is par for the course - theres chases, fights, even a couple of handfuls of suspenseful \"beat-the-clock\"\nmoments. There are a handful of moments which induce laughs or a collective \"Whoa\" from the audience (namely, the\nBatpod). The inclusion of the Joker and his penchant for playing tricks make for some truly interesting setpieces,\nespecially the \"social experiment\" he pulls near the climax.Then we get to the ending. While its not a cliffhanger, it\nreally does end on a rather ambiguous note (kind of like The Road Warrior did) which sort of leaves it open for a third\nfilm, but at the same time doesnt, if that makes any sense. It couldve been handled better, I suppose, but its all\nabout leaving them wanting more and the ending - which shows that things are only going to get much worse for Batman -\ncertainly illustrates that.The Dark Knight really did manage to pull off a miracle. It lived up to all of its hype (both\npre- and post-Ledgers demise) and it indicates that not all blockbusters are going to pot. The only problem I can see\nthis creating is that if there is a third instalment in this new trilogy (which, in all probability, there will be) it\nprobably will not manage to top this one. This will be a one-of-a-kind, and who knows, maybe in 30 years time when\npeople are talking about which sequels were better than the original, the first movie to pop up will be The Dark Knight.",

    "reviewTitle": "Mediocre summer popcorn movie with warped morals",
    "reviewBody": "In reality, I give this film a score of \"4 out of 10\", but the one-star rating you see above is intended to balance out\nthe obvious shill vote (marketing hype, \"astroturf\", 10/10 votes and comments by paid-for marketing weenies posing as\nreal, unbiased people).At the time of this writing, the film has a 9.7-out-of-10 rating which it clearly does not in any\nsense deserve. It merits half that rating.I saw \"Batman\" last night. 2.5 hours meant that one gets ones moneys worth,\nbut heck... its not half as good as advertisers and IMDb.com would have us believe. The plot line drags, the characters\nare shallow, the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped.The \"dark knight\" is more like a dim bulb.Its hard to\nbelieve in Heath Ledger as the Joker. Hes just too broad in the face, one-dimensional in this role, and weighed down by\npoor writing. His makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film, but there were obvious touch-ups and\nclean-ups that reminded the audience \"this is make-believe.\" His garb was supposed to be purple-on-green, but was so\ndark as to look like a black suit. His actions were so reckless that we, as an audience, were constantly reminded that\n\"this aint even close to reality. Even a toddler wouldnt believe that this scheme would leave The Joker alive and\nthriving.\"Worse, were given zero back-story to help us believe that The Jokers feelings and craziness are based on\nsomething. In fact, the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that The Joker has no past, no legitimate reason for\nhis hatred and aggression, and is simply not understandable. To that, I say \"Go back to scriptwriting school, and take a\nfew psychology classes while youre there. A character isnt menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving\nthe emotions.\"Worse, Christian Bale as Batman. Christian Bale, though good at dieting and working out, has all the\nhumanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood. Without a sound track, sure, hed do well as a male model. As a actor,\nthough, hes just taking up space on the screen. Worse, his lisping (with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen\nhis voice) make him unbelievable as Batman and as perfectionist billionaire.Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave an\nunemotive performance. Worse, he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects\nof acting. This is NOT the caliber of performance that he delivered for \"Leon\" (\"The Professional\") and \"Bram Stokers\nDracula\". This was an obvious potboiler, walk-on-and-take-the-money performance.Likewise for all the other performers\nexcept hyperactive Heath Ledger and a small one-dimensional part played by the wife of one character. I felt no emotion\nfrom any of the other actors and actresses, despite the big ups and downs in the plot line. Dammit, if your daddy dies\nor you quit your lifelong job, youghta look a little broken up!With two exceptions, the special effects did nothing for\nme: 1) I felt a bit of adrenalin when Batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his\nshoulder into the street. 2) Harvey Two-faces mask was well done: that gets a thumbs up, though I wouldnt want kids\nseeing it or theyll have nightmares.A few scenes just left me scratching my head, saying \"that would never happen;\nthats beyond stupid, even for a cartoon movie.\" When Batman glides down from one building on his wings, darn it, the\nwings should look full of air like a parachute, not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction!Even the love\ninterest was a bit bland. They found a frumpy, not-too-pretty woman to play Batmans love-of-his-life, and apparently\nasked her to play her role as though nothing-- romance, impending death, and explosions-- matters. Ive seen people\nreact more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a Starbucks! :oThe morality is twisted. From a comic\nbook, one should expect flat, one-dimensional thinking. From Frank Miller, the talented artist but stupid Ayn Rand\nfollower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based, one should expect wildly offensive \"morality\" that would\nmake even an idiot say \"wtf, man, rethink this!\" The plot and characters will inevitably be compared to Americas\nMcCarthyist-style \"war on terrorism\", and that just sickens me, because I see the film try to justify a patronizing,\nlying, violent attitude from government and a billionaire.Everywhere in the film, actors are saying \"This is\nwrong-headed, illegal, untruthful, patronizing to the citizenry, and an abuse of power... but were in a dark, scary\ntime so its OK for now.\" Art imitates life, eh! I felt deeply ill.So far this summer, Hancock is the only superhero\nmovie Id endorse, and that would only get a weak thumbs-up. Its at least funny, and does not try to paint a comic-book\nmorality as \"heroic\".So what SHOULD you see as an action/popcorn movie this summer? Im wondering if the \"Voyage to the\nCenter of the Earth\" film or the new Mummy film, both starring Brendan Frasier, will be a bit better... or at least have\na few funny lines. The trailers, though, hint that theyll be campy and unbelievable.",

    "reviewTitle": "The night is Darkest before the Dawn...",
    "reviewBody": "Is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than I was? Maybe but most probably not. Ive been\nlooking forward to another Batman movie since the credits rolled on \"Batman Begins\" back in 2005. Batman is a movie that\nneeds no synopsis, even for non-fans. But in case you are totally clueless, all you need to know is that Batman is a guy\nthat dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in Gotham city. The Dark Knight continues where Batman Begins left\noff. Christian Bale reprises his role as Barman from the last movie, and this time he has two new villains: The Joker,\nplayed by Heath Ledger and Two-Face/Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. This is no doubt the most hyped movie of the\nyear, especially with Heaths sudden death, and I must tell you it was up to the hype, or very very close to it. Theres\na buzz for an Oscar campaign for Heath and Ill tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an Oscar,\nor at least a nomination. If Warner Brothers didnt tell us Heath was playing The Joker, I swear not many people would\nhave guessed it was him. I know I wouldnt have. So is this a good movie or just a good-Joker-used-to-promote-an-average\nmovie? Good question. But an even better question is did you watch Batman Begins? Did you enjoy it? If you watch this\nmovie, youll never want to watch Batman Begins again because The Dark Knight will make it look like the worst movie\nyouve ever seen. I promise you. Everyone is talking about The Joker, but Harvey Dent/Two face is equally as good. His\nmake- up, as Two Face will blow you away, and his acting is nothing less than amazing. Everyone else reprised their role\nfrom the last movie; all except Katie Holmes which if you ask me is a good move because I felt she didnt really belong\nin the first one. She is replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal, which I love. Director Christopher Nolan is a genius (Yes I know\nall the directors I reviewed are geniuses). He not only made an awesome superhero movie, but an awesome crime/detective\nmovie. His brother Jonathan Nolan worked on the script, and since I saw Memento which the two worked on, I know that\nthese two were born to work together. So is there anything bad about this movie? As another critic rightly put it, \"This\nmovie was too long, but Im only saying this so it seems like Im doing my job...\" That being said, I dont think the\nlength of this movie is a problem at all. I mean, The Godfather ran for almost three hours, I dont hear anyone\ncomplaining. Moreover, in most long movies, youll see a scene or two that can be cut to shorten it, The Dark Knight had\nnone. It was pure two and a half hours of awesomeness! The closing speech of the movie ended with Commissioner Gordon\nsaying \"... hes the Dark Knight\". Then there was a black screen. It was at that time that I noticed tears rolling down\nmy cheeks because of how lucky I feel to be alive to witness this cinematic masterpiece. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is\nthe first movie Ive given 5 out of 5 stars!",

    "reviewTitle": "\"Batman Has No Limits\"",
    "reviewBody": "(Warning! Lots of Spoilers! Only read if youve seen the film!)Batman has leaped straight out of the comic book pages\nand into the real world. To compare \"The Dark Knight\" to say the \"Spider-Man\" franchise for example, is almost a joke.\nThe reboot \"Batman Begins\" established Batman in the real world, and now the sequel takes that an entire step forward.\n\"The Dark Knight\" is more than just a great comic book movie, its a masterpiece.Its been a little over a day since Ive\nseen \"The Dark Knight\". It really lingers in the mind after a while, even if youre not a big fan of Batman you will be\nof this future classic crime drama. As Ive pondered over the film more and more, Ive come to understand its many\ncomplexities.Since the first film, the mob is getting more and more desperate to launder their cash. Why? Because Batman\nhas been cleaning up the streets and cops and lawyers can no longer be bought. The Joker is employed by the mob to take\ndown the Batman and bring corruption back to Gotham. Until Batman turns himself in, The Joker will continue to kill\npeople. Is Batman a hero? Or just a vigilante looking for self righteousness?While re watching \"The Prestige\" the other\nday, knowing the twist ending, it was beautiful to see how well crafted it was. How much little things that may seem\nlike padding are actually hints that apply to the symbolism of the entire film. The same goes for \"The Dark Knight\". Not\nonly is it a good picture that stays true to the characters and stories of Batman, like \"Batman Begins\" did, but its\nreally an artful film. Thats a lot to say for a movie based off of a comic book.As the credits started to roll I\nwondered what the plot twist was. I thought to myself \"There must not be one in this film\", little did I know how subtle\nit was. Upon further pondering I figured it out. Bale replies to Caine in one scene \"Batman has no limits\". That\nstatement is both true and false. The Joker tempts Batman to \"break his one rule\".Another part of the film that has deep\nmeaning is The Joker. We know from the film that The Joker was somehow abused in the past. So he has lost all faith in\npeople. There is evil in everyone. Two sides one \"coin\". The Joker strives to create dramatic examples. By corrupting\nBatman, their White Knight, and themselves. \"When it comes down to it, every man for himself, every person is evil\" is\nhis basic logic. The Joker acknowledges that he is morally wrong, but wants to prove it to Batman and everyone else in\nGotham that they are not much different from himself (Thats a little Killing Joke for you).The films puts you into a an\nexciting roller coaster, and a rather abrupt, yet beautiful ending that will leave you stunned. The story is intelligent\nand action-packed, it is wonderfully well acted to create great characters, and it really speaks to you.Batman breaks\nthe law for justice, the city who he protects hates him, and yet he still fights injustice for the right reasons. To\nkeep an eight year olds parents from dying. He will only stop when the evil that created Batman is gone. Thats what a\nhero is. A+",

    "reviewTitle": "\"Best Comic Book Based Movie Ever\"",
    "reviewBody": "The most anticipated movie of the year finally hits screens this Friday, both in 2-D and IMAX formats. Christian Bale\nreturns as the mysterious and ultra rich Bruce Wayne/Batman. Violence has plagued the streets in Gotham City (which\nlooks a lot like Chicago) and Batman teams up with Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to\nweed out the crime, in which a new villain arrives, played by the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, unleashing unspeakable\nhorror and crime to the citizens of Gotham City. It becomes the Jokers mission to beat Batman at his own game,\ntherefore making his revenge very personal as he playfully quips, \"Criminals used to believe in things like honor,\nrespect. What doesnt kill you makes you stranger\". Im totally recommending The Dark Knight to be seen on the biggest\nscreen possible, perhaps at an IMAX screen nearest you. Watching Christopher Nolans near masterpiece gave me a whole\nnew level of movie-going experience and this fascinating director has definitely set the bar even higher for comic book\nbased movies, which he had already done with his earlier film, Batman Begins. This is the first Hollywood film that used\nIMAX digital cameras that was partially shot in this new and improved format. I certainly experienced vertigo in certain\nscenes as the camera hovered above city skyscrapers such as the ones that took place in Hong Kong as Batman stood still\non the corner of a building looking down. The Dark Knight delivers in all areas. But let me for a talk for a second\nabout the action scenes. They are definitely incredible! The death-defying stunt work looks pretty authentic and any\ncomputer generated imagery was covert and difficult to pin-point. Take for example as Batmans heavy armored vehicle\nloses all power and it reactivates itself into some sort of over-sized motorcycle; Batman races at breakneck speeds\nthrough tunnels and buildings then in and around a 18 wheeler, flipping it violently upside down with Bat-wires. An\nincredible feat that only last seconds but one where I had to catch my breath. Much has been talked about Ledgers eerie\nportrayal of the Joker. Ledger loses himself in this role like Marlon Brando did in The Godfather and Anthony Hopkins\ndoes in The Silence of the Lambs. Its sorrowfully chilling and definitely that good. Hell for sure be nominated for a\nBest Supporting Oscar as should the film for Best Picture. At over 2 1/2 hours long, this is definitely one of the\nlongest comic book based movies, but Nolan and his editor, Lee Smith, move things along just fine. There is some fine\nmusic by two maestros, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, both Academy Award winners; they dont inundate us with\nheavy piercing sound through the actions scene but instead let those scenes entertain us for themselves. The\ncinematography and set designs are dark and moody but appropriate for this type of film. With its technical\naccomplishments, very fine performances (including Morgan Freeman as technical wizard Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as\nbutler Alfred Pennyworth) most especially by Ledger, The Dark Knight is not only one of the best films of the year\n(which also works splendidly as a crime thriller) but will go down in history as the best comic book based movie ever.",

Chris  David realize they were able to bypass unsurmountable corporate loopholes to deliver a\nmore intelligent character adaptation of film. Less candy and actually respect the intelligence of the audience and the\npower they have with imagination. The Dark Knight is heavy in development that pays off with what they dont tell you -\nThey juggle the (spoiler ahead) notion that lets get the audience to have a taste of the Joker in the same manner as how\nBatman deals with him - no history, no understanding, just utter chaos and moral-less havoc. - Bloody brilliant\nperformance by all actors, not just heath but I would nominate Gary for his amazing ability to embody Commissioner\nGordan. The irony of the cast you would discount Bale because his role is hidden behind the mask - but his talents and\ndedication to the craft has elevated Bruce/Batman to a level where the audience cant think of a better actor to play\nthe lead role.The Dark Knight has given the audience a reason to come to the theaters - not merely to be entertained but\nto be enlightened by such masterful attention to detail, hard work and a movie that weighs heavy because it doesnt\nsecond guess the audience - I was in awe of its spectacle and was left speechless after the preview - I am actually\nafraid to see it again on IMAX and be weighted down with emotions on how poetic this film is and will be for\ngenerations..be prepared for film noir - brilliance.

It was comparable\nto a never ending roller-coaster ride of various emotions and of crafty mindgames. To say that it was unnecessarily long\nwould be true, but I dont think anyone in the cinema really cared - because every single scene, every little second was\nessential, entertaining and breathtaking. It was the complete experience which just couldnt be dissected into random\nfacets.The cinematography and the music were very effective. The dark grays which pretty much bordered most of the\nscenes, the clever editing and the suspenseful pace molded it to become one heck of a great movie.The story was\nsurprisingly complex and intelligent, which is not very common in superhero movies. Distinctive philosophies and\nopposing personalities came into play in a war of extremes.The character development was very comprehensive and the cast\nwas excellent. Christian Bale was effortlessly Batman and Bruce Wayne once again, silent, dashing, troubled and cunning.\n(I still hate Batmans scary raspy robotic voice though.) He was indeed the flawed hero. Much has been said about Heath\nLedgers performance as the psychotic and merciless Joker, and you especially ought to see it for yourselves. He was\nfunny, creepy, alarming, perplexing and everything else in between. He was subtle and he was overpowering... He totally\nowned it down to the random flicks of his tongue.Maggie Gyllenhaal was initially a turn off as I felt as if the role of\nRachel Dawes didnt suit her for some reason, but she grew on me. It was funny though how it seemed as if she was acting\nas \"Katie Holmes\" and not as \"Rachel Dawes\". Aaron Eckhart was excellent as District Attorney Harvey Dent but was\nsomewhat a disappointment as Two-Face. Im not sure if Heath Ledger merely upstaged him as a villain, but something was\ncertainly lacking in Two-Face. Perhaps more personality, more polarity - he was Two-Face after all. Gary Oldman, Morgan\nFreeman and Michael Caine were also notable in their subdued minor roles.I was never a comic book fan, but if there ever\nwas a movie that in all honesty made me want to be one - it would have to be The Dark Knight. (Though some say it was\nquite different from the comic.) With its complexity, its gritty action, its genuine characters, its resolute\nintelligence and its incredible tragedy, it was something that leaves one breathless. Exhausted even.Sure, the movie had\nit flaws - but seriously, I dont think anyone would even dare to nitpick.It was intimate and yet epic, it was\nexhilarating and yet heartbreaking. I would absolutely watch it again.",

    "reviewTitle": "So awesome, theyre going to need to come up with a new adjective to describe it",
    "reviewBody": "I dont usually write reviews like this. In fact, I generally only do it if a film is either abysmal or mind-numbingly\ngood. The Dark Knight is one of the latter.Theres only one man and one film I can relate this one two, and ironically\nenough, its Joel Schumachers Batman and Robin, a film which is despised by anyone with half a brain. It may seem a\nlittle odd for me to be making the comparison, but please, hear me out: the reason Im likening Nolan to Schumacher when\ntheyre so far apart in terms of the quality of films they produced that they shouldnt even be mentioned in the same\nsentence together is because they both has an astronomical effect on the franchise. Sure, Schumachers was for all the\nwrong reasons, but Nolan also takes Batman in directions we never thought possible.The Dark Knight is the superhero film\nweve been waiting for since Superman II. In some respects, its been almost thirty years in the making. One of my\nfavourite writers of all time - Joss Whedon - once related how he saw the trailer to Batman Returns and was disappointed\nin it because the plot involved the bad guys attempting to frame Batman. If youre the villain, you dont frame your\nhero, Whedon says. You corrupt him. You take away everything he loves, destroy everything he stands for and drag him\ndown to your level so that even if he wins, you dont lose because hell be no better than you. And The Dark Knight does\njust that.Performance-wise, the first mention has to go to Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, because its very easy to add\nhim as an afterthought to Heath Ledgers Joker. Like the marketing material says, you surely do BELIEVE in Harvey Dent.\nHes armed with more charisma than one man should legally be allowed to carry around, a kind of magnetism that comes\nfrom a natural leader. Sure, he can seem naive to the point of cheesiness, but it really does work. More, Eckhart pulls\nit off with a kind of laziness that makes it look easy.As for the Joker ... well, I think its safe to say Heath Ledger\nis going to be the new standard by which film villains are going to be judged. You wouldnt know it was Ledger in the\nrole if you hadnt been told beforehand; Ive seen actors immerse themselves in roles - Nathan Fillion in Firefly and\nSerenity springs to mind - but until I saw The Dark Knight, I had never see an actor sink themselves into a character as\nfar as Ledger did, and its deeply unfair to see him get all the best lines and most of the best moments.And of course,\nChrstian Bale is far more subtle in his approach. While I would have liked to see a few more scenes with him as Bruce\nWayne, I still liked him. And ye, hes better than Michael Keaton. Not in the same way that Heath Ledger is better than\nJack Nicholson - there, I said it - but in his own way, adding as much depth to Wayne as to Batman. Meanwhile, Michael\nCaine and Morgan Freeman are their usual selves, which is a drawcard in their favour as this film certainly needed\nstability in the form of those characters. Its good to see Gary Oldman as James Gordon getting something to do and\nbeing able to do them himself - something I felt previous incarnations of the character never got to do - and Maggie\nGyllenhaal more than makes up for Katie Holmes performance in Batman Begins (to the point where you have to wonder what\nboth the films would have been like if one of the two stayed for both films).The Dark Knight isnt a perfect film, but\nthen show me one that is. Theres a few minor issues here and there; one sequence that sticks out in my mind is late in\nthe film where we see the film in a kind of super-sonar view, with the end result being that its jarring, a little\nconfusing and the images and sounds push it to the extent of sensory overload (but it was nearly 2am when I saw it ...).\nComparisons to Heat and The Godfather Part II are wholly deserved: The Dark Knight isnt just a superhero film, its\nsomething more by a whole order of magnitude.",

    "reviewTitle": "Too long and too confusing.",
    "reviewBody": "I had the luxury of seeing Dark Knight when it first hit theaters this week and let me tell you, I was quite\ndisappointed.I do not understand what the rave reviews are about but I found the plot line very complicated and\nconfusing most times. Jumping from here to there, pushing far too much for a nearly 3 hour movie. Heath Ledger is an\nexcellent actor of course but I found Nolans version of Joker very demented and nothing like the comic book Joker or\ncartoons. He seemed like a mental patient then the Joker I grew up reading. Where were the jokes and the twisted sense\nof humor? The only thing they left was the menacing laugh which Ledger did fantastically.While I love watching\nSuperheros, there just wasnt enough Batman. The whole movie focused a lot on the Harvey Dent character, who in my\nopinion should have been left for the third installment. It was already enough to have Joker as the villain, but\nTwo-Face too? The development of Two-Face was quick as it ended. And his agenda was too poor to be believable as to why\nhe was the classic Two-Face Batman fans know of.Batman himself was ho-hum. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but as\nbatman? No. That voice he puts on which supposedly was to be menacing came up more constipated and very forced. You\ncould barely hear his dialog along with his spit fly out of his mouth occasionally. However, I did enjoy his fighting,\nwhich was downright how I see Batman fight the big baddies. But the main thing that bothered me most on whole that was\nmissing was the Batmobile. I have no idea what Nolan was thinking to not include it in the movie. It was the main\nreasons I wanted to see it in the first place. Not to mention his classic domain, the Batcave, which was replaced with\nan underground high-tech warehouse. Not impressive.Overall, the movie was just too long, too complicated and\nforgettable. I favor Tim Burtons Batman over Nolans version by a long shot. But then, everyone has their own\nopinion.4/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Why so serious, right?",
    "reviewBody": "\"The Dark Knight\" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolans latest wonder\nconcerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor\n\"Batman Begins\". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolans Batman\nis what it is because it isnt just about the adrenaline. Its still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening\nsequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place;\norganized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally\nvillains dont call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to\ntalk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer\nwith or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once\nyouve watched the film, but theres one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations\nwith Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce\ndoesnt understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will\ntell the superhero: \"You complete me\". That phrase reminded me of the great movie \"Unbreakable\" is. But, actually, what\nis a hero and what is a villain? In Nolans brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual\ncollaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the\never exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowleys spectacular production design. \"Its\nnot what underlies you, but what you do that defines you\", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal\ntold Bruce in \"Batman Begins\". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and\na new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart). Lets not forget that Batman is more human than any of the\nother superheroes of the comic books. In this film, hes never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting;\nwithout knowing if hes the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him\nfall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little\nfight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of \"The Dark Knights\" treats to the viewer. Another\nmajor treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when\nhe says the town \"deserves a better kind of criminal\"-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-)\nthat equals Batman in human qualities. I dont mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people\nwill find inspiring things in his weirdness), Im simply referring to the fact that he doesnt fly through the air or\nowns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose. Heath Ledger steals the film (and\nwill get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces\nthis human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in \"Batman Begins\". Without overacting, Ledger\ncreates an individual that we can call a freak, because its the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He\nhas all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger\ntells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name,\nnor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount\nof grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. Its Heath Ledgers great acting what generates\nall this.The rest of the ensemble, as in \"Batman Begins\", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and\nmakes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in\nwhich the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie thats\nprofound in the best sense of the wordA word we dont use so much for comic book movies.AnywayBatman may not know if\nhes the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but \"The Dark Knight\" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer\ndeserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like\nme, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?",

And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top! Heath Ledger gave\nthe performance of his life. You really have to give credit to the man; he did came a long way from A Knights Tale and\n10 Things. His Joker was discomfiting, psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns! With his passing, it up the\nspooky scale a few notches. He held his own against the big wigs - well, I think he even surpassed a few of them. He has\nthe best one-liners too! His lines spoke of chaos, death or the lack thereof. Art imitating life or vice versa. One\nwonders if he took his character a tad too far.To sum it all up, The Dark Knight has twists at every turn, exciting\nbatmobile chases, cool new gadgets (and suit!), stellar performances, tight plots and witty script. This made for a very\ngood summer movie.Go watch it or youll be the last not to. And parting in the Jokers (now famous) line - \"Why so\nserious?\"",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Superhero Movie Ever",
    "reviewBody": "Most superhero movies are made to give you a feeling of escapism. THat webbing through rooftops or having claws for\nhands would be great and wishing that you yourself had that power. Not this one. The Dark Knight begins where the last\none left off, with the theme of escalation.Batman ( Christian Bale ) and Liutenant Gordon( Gary Oldman ) with the help\nof the new District Attorney Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) have smashed crime to the point where they are beginning to\nrun scared. Batman himself is beginning to think that soon he may be able to hang up the cape and the cowl for good and\nreunite with Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ).However, the mob has one last resort up its sleeve, and its a proposal\nby a rising criminal known only to the citizens of Gotham as the Joker ( Heath Ledger ). The Joker, however, has an\nagenda entirely of his own and soon begins to cause terror on a massed scale which has even Batman lost for ideas. The\nDark Knight is a really amazing film, which utillises real live stunts to great effect, making seem so much more gritty\nand dark than its neon-lit competitors. Be warned that it is not a film for kids, as the violence, in particular\nperpetrated by the Joker is confronting and at times very twisted. Christian Bale, while still not quite of the level of\nMichael Keatons Batman, still does a very good job while Michael Caine is once again great as his stoic butler. Morgan\nFreeman is good and Aaron Eckhart brings a great element of tragedy to the role of Harvey Dent. But it is Gary Oldman\nand Heath Ledger who truly excel. Oldmans Gordon is a conflicted character who is put through the wringer throughout\nthe movie by both his allies and his enemies while being nothing more than an honest cop- one of the last ones. But\neveryone here is playing second fiddle to the Joker. Heath Ledger brings him a menace and an edge which is so tangible\nthat at times it is truly terrifying. His laugh is bone-chilling and his sense of humour is both funny and incredibly\ntwisted as his philosophy. He deserves every amount of praise, as it is a truly awful foe for Batman to face. The Dark\nKNight is a superhero film full of twists and turns that never lets up. Instead it graps you by your lapels and drags\nyou into its dark majestic splendour.",

    "reviewTitle": "Little to do with Ledger . . .",
    "reviewBody": "\"Evil is the nature of mankind.\" Hawthornes \"Young Goodman Brown\" I have a strong urge to downgrade Christopher Nolans\nDark Knight to a B for BEING too long, for BEARING too many anti-climaxes, BUT it also happens to BE the best super-hero\nmovie of the summer and one of the BEST comic book adaptations ever. This praise has little to do with Heath Ledgers\nmemorable turn as The Joker, so good it will instantaneously make you forget Jack Nicholsons famous rendition.What\nreally qualifies Dark Knight is the titular fulfillment: Not only does Christian Bales Batman become dark, almost every\nmajor character goes through a dark night of the soul, except the ruleless Joker, for whom evil is a playful way of\nliving out his days. The characters are challenged by the evil and goodness of humanity and of themselves. Like many of\nus, being good for these characters ironically involves personal vanity and a vulnerability to love.So ingenious is the\nscript that at any one point, multiple good guys could be bad with the flip of a coin. District Attorney Harvey Dent\n(Aaron Eckhart) is a case in point: He becomes the new Gotham hero by rounding up the usual mob suspects; he becomes a\nproblematic warrior in the real struggle of the soul, whereby he must reconcile his inherently virtuous soul with the\nrequisite means of fighting evil, a moral trap the Joker plays well.Dark Knight easily buddies up with Iron Mans\nambiguity this summer as it pokes the audience with quandaries about the endless and tiring clash with evil (read 9/11\nand the Iraq War) and the means to revenge or end the mayhem (read Neocon strategies). However if you dont wish to\nindulge these allegorical fancies, just enjoy cinematographer Wally Pfisters transformation of Chicago into a fantasy\nland almost better than a comic books art.But the film doesnt leave the people of Gotham and presumably the audience\nout of the mix either, for they all must make choices from as banal as blowing up a boat to as profound as tracking down\ntheir saviors, The agent of evil, the Joker, makes believable the racking decisions he maneuvers for private citizens\nand public officials. In the end, they are in control of their moral choices-the jokes on them.As Joker says, \"What\ndoesnt kill you makes you stranger.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "I love Christopher Nolan....",
    "reviewBody": "Dear God I love Christopher Nolan. In his five film career, beginning with \"Memento\" he has not put a foot wrong,\nbuilding a body of work which supports the assertion that he is the most talented director of his generation. With The\nDark Knight he has created the best comic book film ever. Period.Dark Knight is the most perfect blend of style and\nsubstance, action and drama that Ive ever seen. Its technically brilliant, with awe inspiring action sequences that\nmust be seen to be believed. The action however, is not superfluous but feeds off the dramatic subtext of the script.\nNolan explores what it is to be a hero, and the pitfalls of protecting a city that seems to be suffering because of the\nvery existence of that so called hero. Each actor slips perfectly into their role, with honourable mention going to\nAaron Eckhart who did far better than I expected as Harvey Dent. Towering above them all however is Heath Ledger. Almost\n20 years ago Jack Nicholson portrayed a Joker that many felt could never be topped or re-attempted. Whilst it is unfair\nto compare the two, one certainty is that it will be at least that long again before any other actor can don the\nmaniacal grin once more. True, the Joker by his very nature is bound to steal the show.....true, the Nolan brothers have\nscripted the Joker in a unique way, filled with memorable dialogue. Nothing however, can take away from Ledger, whos\nevery movement, every word, every physical nuance is part of a meticulously crafted madman. This Joker ranks among the\ngreatest of villains as he seemingly needs no motivation for his actions other than the constant thirst for chaos. The\nJoker is all animalistic instinct and in Batman the Joker has found a nemesis whom he enjoys being pitted against. For\nthe Joker it is not the outcome that is important but the fight itself. His lack of fear or reverence to anything is\ntruly terrifying. Ledgers final completed performance is perhaps the mot bittersweet piece of acting to watch as it now\nserves as a swansong, rather than heralding the arrival of a monumentally talented superstar. There is nothing I can say\nabout Ledger, or the film that hasnt already been said but in there lies the films true brilliance......I feel the\nneed to rave about it anyway.",

Boy! Am I ever more wrong....This movie keeps its pace, not too fast, not too slow but everything\nkeeps piling up, breaking down and piles higher again. Wow!!! All of Marvels recent movies cannot even dream of\nmatching half the success of this one. My goodness! I have seen a true translation of the Dark Knight.Enough of an old\nfan boys ramblings.First, the plots and story. Like I have mentioned the plot keeps adding up even when you thought it\nwas being broken down. However, do not expect a run-stop-run type of story pace. This is maintains a relatively steady\npace, very unusual for an action movie. Expect the unexpected unless you are a fan of many years.Second, the acting. I\nam so glad they replaced Katie Holmes because I dont believe she will be able to handle the role this well. Ms Maggie\nGyllenhaal, you showed us how to turn a relatively understated role into a good performance. I wish you could return in\nthe sequel, but... sigh... So many good young actors in this movie that veteran actors, Michael Caine and Morgan\nFreeman, were outshone.A personal question to the late Mr Heath Ledger. Why did you have to die?!!!! I want to see your\nJoker again!! You were perfect as the Joker... no, you are the Joker! Youve effectively given Joker his menace back and\nnow, we will all be deprive of the return of this Joker. Your best work is your last. I salute you, but if you can\nplease come back from wherever you are.... we want to see you in one of the sequels.Third, the director. Thank you.If\nanyone of you still have not watch this one, What the hell are you waiting for? Get off that seat and go watch a true\nmasterpiece. I will remember this movie for years to come.",

    "reviewTitle": "New Classic",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is unlike any superhero movie that has come before it, and that includes the stellar Batman Begins.\nWhile 2005s origin story was a breakthrough with its Gothic visuals and harsh realistic tone, director Christopher\nNolans next entry in the series shatters what weve known as the walls of the superhero genre. An ensemble political\nthriller as much as it is a tale of revenge and derring-do, The Dark Knight is a wondrous, terrifying epic.Heath\nLedgers Joker is the embodiment of all terror and rage, an evil force as illogical as a tornado, and fearless in the\nway only a sociopath can be. He sets his sights on Batman only because he wants the game of crime to be more fun, and\nwages a war of aimless chaos against Gotham while taunting Batman to reveal his face. The Joker demands that Gotham\naccept a life without rules, and as Dent, Gordon and Batman become increasingly desperate to stop him, theyre each\nforced to break the rules theyve lived by. The Dark Knight is peppered with lots of talk about dark vs. light, good vs.\nevil, freak vs. human-- familiar comic book stuff, and familiar stuff for Christopher Nolan too, he of Memento and The\nPrestige. Nolan believes so much in the real-world implications of Batmans story that what seems hokey in other movies\nfeels desperately urgent here. There are lots and lots of speeches, with deeply intoned aphorisms about morality and\ntruth, but they fit into Nolans larger portrait of a city just barely teetering above chaos. As the Joker says near the\nend of the film, \"Madness is like gravity-all it takes is a single push.\" Each of the main characters, the Joker\nincluded, are standing on a ledge.They say every era gets the kind of hero it deserves, and The Dark Knight is surely a\nsuperhero movie for our times, in which even the best of men can find themselves doing wrong. The hopeful exuberance of\nSpider-Man, made before 9/11, isnt bad in comparison; it just doesnt fit with where we are now. Nolan has shown a new\nway to tell a superhero story, and it may turn out to be the only way to tell a story about heroes in this troublingly\namoral time. We may want our white knights, but its the dark knight that we need.",

    "reviewBody": "I must give Christopher Nolan credit. He took a franchise that seemed doomed and rebooted it with \"Batman Begins\",\ntaking a huge risk by making it darker and more serious. This time, now that all of the necessary background information\nhas already been presented, he takes things one step further by making it darker, more serious, and more exciting.\"The\nDark Knight\" is an unbelievably exciting, funny, and creepy movie all at the same time, and they all hit the viewer in\nequal amounts. Heath Ledgers performance is the masterful center of the movie, complimented wonderfully by Bales\nbatman, Oldmans Gordon, and Eckharts Harvey Dent. The first half of the movie sets up so many shocking moments and\ntake-your-breath-away action scenes that its hard to catch your breath, but Ive never felt so great hardly being able\nto breathe.However... the second half of the movie gets a little heavy, and to avoid spoilers I will just say that I\nthink this movie would have worked nicely split up into two. However, thats not nearly enough to make someone forget\nthe fact that this is the most exciting movie of the year (sorry, Iron Man) and the second movie weve seen guaranteed\nof an Oscar nomination (after Wall-E). Go see it now.",

    "reviewTitle": "Action, action, action, and Heath Ledgers Oscar-worthy final performance",
    "reviewBody": "I attended a screening of \"The Dark Knight\" last night. Indies are really my preference and, at $150 million+, this\nWarner Brothers movie is about as Hollywood as it gets. But its impossible not to discuss this film, especially in the\nlight of the untimely passing of one of our most gifted actors. The Joker was Heath Ledgers final role.Pluses: Action,\naction, action, and more action. Did I say action? Good Lord. Guns, bombs, explosions, knives, fistfights, various other\nweapons, car chases, more explosions, more bombs, and more car chases.You know how in most action movies theres one\ngreat bomb/explosion scene? Something big is blown up towards the end? Well, in director/co-writer Christopher Nolans\n\"The Dark Knight\" it happens time and time again, all throughout the film. Not only do you not have to wait until the\nthird act to see something huge blown to smithereens but, every time you think, \"ah, thats the big explosion of the\nmovie,\" theres another. And another.Best of all, though, are the chases. This movie has some of the best chase scenes\nIve ever seen. And theres not just one. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and even helicopters are involved in some fantastic\naction sequences. Crashes galore. And, just like with the explosions, just when you think youve seen \"the\" big chase\nscene, theres another. And another.The action is relentless.Theres even a love story thrown in for the ladies. And not\none F-bomb. Not even an S-word. No sex. No skin. The kids will love it. Men, women, teens, all will find something to\nlike here.Minuses: The storyline is a bit confusing. Theres Batman/Bruce Wayne, the Joker, the district attorney,\npolice commissioner, mayor, the Hong Kong businessman, the Mafia, and various other public officials and thugs. All play\na role in the plot at some point, more or less, and its hard to tell the players without a scorecard.Someone said to\nme, \"a comic book story and its hard to follow?\" Well, frankly, yes. I actually wished it was a bit more mindless so\nthat I could focus on the action. I would have preferred to use my brain less in this case, to tell you the truth. But\nit didnt lessen the films impact.Christian Bale is a capable Batman. But \"The Dark Knight\" is, most of all, a tribute\nto Heath Ledger. His Joker and intense, maniacal portrait of him is, supposedly, what drove him to his death. As the\nstory goes, he couldnt leave the character at the set. It haunted him day and night. Its not hard to see why. His\nperformance is so chilling that it was hard to see him on screen and not imagine what it must have been like for him\nwhen he went home at the end of the day. Ideally, one is not supposed to be taken out of a movie -- the audience should\nnever think about the actor instead of the character. But it was hard not to, knowing that this was the final role of\nhis life, and one which may have contributed to ending it. That made it even more frightening.The curiosity factor will\nprobably get people into the theaters who might not otherwise have gone. But its just as well. It will be his legacy,\nor part of it, and must be seen to be believed.Is \"The Dark Knight\" the best film of the year? I dont think so. Will it\nmake a gazillion dollars and turn out to be the #1 movie of the year? I wouldnt be surprised. Is it worth seeing? Yes,\nId recommend it to just about anyone. Does Heath Ledger deserve an Oscar? Id say yes. His performance IS all that the\nhype has led you to believe it is.",

    "reviewBody": "After going into this moving hearing a great deal of hype , I had my doubts. I thought that much of the praise heaped on\nLedgers performance was probably undue. (I have never particularly cared much for Heaths work in the past, although I\nhave yet to see Brokeback.) But I was STUNNED by the quality of his performance in this film. He was genuinely dark and\ndisturbing. His voice, his mannerisms and his intensity all served to make this Joker one of the most memorable roles of\nthis decade. In short, he was truly outstanding! Its a good thing he was outstanding. Because while the writing was\ninteresting and attempted to deal with the true nature of humanity, with typical comic book caricaturisation, most the\nother performances were not particularly strong. Christian Bale and Maggie Gyllenhaal appeared a bit flat and better\nsuited to the previous generation of Batman movies than this one. They just werent on the same level. Aaron Eckhart was\ndecent and Gary Oldman was good, although the part is a little dull for him.And, as with all these movies, there were\nlittle details that were unnecessary and unrealistic. The most glaring was two-faces condition. It was just an\nappalling bad idea. Ib the plus side, however, most of the physics werent particularly cartoonish, for which I am very\ngrateful!Overall, I thought it was an excellent comic book film and I would recommend it to any adult who can deal with\na bit of violence. What shortcomings the film has are overshadowed by a brilliant performance by Ledger that it makes\nthis film a must see.",

    "reviewTitle": "Perfect",
    "reviewBody": "We all remember how good Batman Begins was, right? Well, after seeing the much anticipated (and hyped) sequel, Begins is\nchilds play.\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Were tonights entertainment...\" The action kicks off with a bank\nheist that brings back memories of Michael Manns excellent Heat (a feeling that lingered for the entire movie) and\nmore-or-less introduces us to The Joker. Now believe me when I say that The Joker is completely mental. Heath Ledgers\nperformance is brilliant. Theres talk of an Oscar nomination, something which is very much deserved. He completely\ndisappears into his character, perfecting the best screen villain since Hannibal Lecter. Just check out the scene with\nthe pencil... The Joker prefers the slow kill. He is tortured by his sinister smile (and when you hear how he got it it\nwill send shivers down your spine). But the thing that is truly sinister about him is hes not into crime for the money.\nThe Joker kills and stirs the pot-because he can.\"This city deserves a better class of criminal... and Im gonna give it\nto them!\" With praise for The Joker out of the way, its time to acknowledge the other key players in this epic crime\nthriller. Morgan Freeman manages to put a new twist on his never-ending good guy roles (he was God once, for Christs\nsake), Maggie Gyllenhaal is the perfect replacement for the bland Katie Holmes as Batmans long time friend and love\ninterest Rachel Dawes, Nestor Carbonell (of Lost fame) nails the Gotham City Mayor and the awesome Michael Caine is, you\nguessed it, awesome as Batmans trusty butler Alfred. Another interesting point of this movie is we get insight into all\nof these characters, even Alfred, whos often just a plot device in previous Batman movies.\"The night is darkest just\nbefore the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming...\" Following the opening heist we see everyones favourite\ntroubled millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, cinemas definitive Batman) in his Bat-Suit once again cleaning the\nstreets of Gotham, before getting the news from his close friend and clean cop James Gordon (Gary Oldman, reprising his\nrare good guy role from Begins) that it would be wise to work with the citys District Attourney Harvey Dent (Aaron\nEckhart, perfectly cast) in their attempts to clean the streets of criminals. This begins a series of events that brings\nBatman to the attention of The Joker, who then plots to kill him in order to maintain criminal status of Gotham, first\ntargeting various authority figures including the Mayor and Dent.\"So what are you proposing?\" \"Its simple: kill The\nBatman...\" To say much more about the plot would weaken the experience of the film, but there is one other key point of\nthis film, and that is the dramatic rise and fall of Harvey Dent and his painfully emotional and physical transformation\ninto Harvey Two-Face...\"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain...\" All in all,\nthis film is perfectly written, there are action scenes a-plenty but they dont interfere with the extraordinary\ncharacter development, contains brilliant performances all round, especially the power-house performance by Heath\nLedger, directed with confidence and gusto by Christopher Nolan and is darkly funny for the most part, but takes itself\nvery seriously when it comes to the drama.\"Know your limits, Master Wayne.\" \"Batman has no limits.\" The verdict: The\nDark Knight is stunning. It will be regarded as one of the best movies of the noughties, if not all time. It twists the\nstandard comic-book formula and sets the standards of every comic-book and crime-thriller movie yet to be made. In a\nword: perfect.",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is a great movie. Rarely does a film bring you to the edge of your seat with creeping dread but this one\ndoes. I saw it at an early show but the audience still applauded afterward. That tradition has been slowly dying out and\nit was nice to see a movie like this bring it back. Lets see... where to start? Ill keep this short and spoiler\nfree.The acting was good by all involved and its true that Leagers performance as the Joker rises above just being\ngood. It is a great performance worthy of an Oscar. Theres a part of me thats angry that drugs took away such a great\nactor and a bit towards him also for choosing that dangerous, worthless path. Perhaps thats selfish of me but its also\na compliment to the talent he wasted. I also liked Harvey Dent by Aaron Eckhart despite some reviews criticizing it. I\nam not a reader of the comic books but I found Two Faces creation story to be about as realistic as possible. Im not\nsure how they could possibly top this movie in a sequel and I dont know if any other villain could live up to the\nstandard that the Joker set here. Well see, I guess.Realism. Lets talk about that. The success of this movie is\nfounded upon a more realistic portrayal of Batman and Gotham and of the superhero genre in general. Sure the action is\namped way, way up but the director, Tim Nolan, somehow manages to make it feel plausible enough that you stop worrying\nabout how preposterous it all is and focus on the story. I like this new approach, the opposite of camp, and when it\nmatches the source material, it should be used from now on. The Hellboy movies have also benefited from this. Truth:\ntake the source seriously and you end up with a better finished product. Hollywood got something right this time even if\nweve had to suffer through countless superhero movies and films designed not to challenge us more than some executives\nthink we can handle.I dont want to give anything away but this movie takes you on an emotional journey that leaves you\na little exhausted at the end. It has action, suspense, terror, true love (and not true love), philosophy... and its\nall woven into a complex gripping story. It is remarkable that it managed to keep so many plates spinning at once. Im\nimpressed.Go see this movie. See it on the big screen. Youll thank me for it. It is worthy of a second theatre viewing\nand Ill be going again.",

I was thrilled to some degree to see the new Batman movie and\nall, but I didnt expect to see the cinematic genius that was on the screen. The film truly had it all, fast paced\naction, dramatic rendering, comedic relief, and superb acting with flawless delivery, most notably by the late Heath\nLedger. What surprised me the most was that this wasnt just a high budget action flick, it also made the audience\nthink, at times it was even reminiscent of Fight Club in its affinity for making viewers examine society. I wouldnt\ndare spoil the film for anyone reading this, but the plot was masterfully crafted and the twists will surely leave\nviewers on the edge of their seats.

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight, a new kind of comic book movie",
    "reviewBody": "Last night I was privileged enough to see The Dark Knight. The local radio stations offered press screener passes in\nexchange for waiting in line for more than three hours (dont mock me, I was number 80 in line, number 1 got there 4\nhours before I did). I had been anticipating this release for months now, and I was not let down. Before I go into\nspecifics, let me tell you that all the hype, all the crazy viral campaigns to build up support for this movie did not\noversell it. All the waiting was worth it. The Dark Knight is the best Batman movie yet. First, lets discuss the\nelephant in the room, Heath Ledger. There has been a lot of talk about how his portrayal of The Joker might get him an\nOscar. I think there is a good chance he will. I say this because last years Supporting actor award winner was the same\nlevel of insanity. The Joker is to The Dark Knight what Anton Chigurh is to No Country for Old Men. Instead of a villain\nwith any moral convictions or rules or even goals, you get something almost elemental. Every time Joker is in the scene\nyou tighten up because you dont know what hes thinking (just wait for the magic disappearing pencil scene). The acting\nis superb. I had to stop and remind myself who was behind that makeup. Ledger was able to take a character that is so\ncomplex and bring him to life. I will grant that the sick and twisted games played by Joker are the writing of\nChristopher Nolan, David Goyer, and Nolans brother, BUT thats not what makes the Joker complete. Its all the little\nthings. Its the way he stalks around people, the way he licks his scars, those little... quirks that make him real. One\nscene still gives me shivers just because of the way the Joker responds to a cop when the cop says that Joker killed six\nof his friends. There is almost a torture movie slant to the character. What can I do to inspire the most possible\nterror in this city? The relationship between Joker and Batman is very loyal to the comic books as well. Nolan doesnt\neven try to explain the Jokers past existence. As far as we should be concerned, he didnt exist until Batman came to\nGotham city. One of the parts I loved about the movie was how Joker puts together stories of his past that keep\nchanging. In truth, everyone seems to bring their A-game to the show. The Dark Knight adds depth to all of the\ncharacters. Gary Oldman makes Jim Gordon come alive. Hell, theres one part of the story that pretty much brought tears\nto my eyes concerning Gordon. Michael Caine gives more depth to Alfred, providing some clues to his background. Aaron\nEckhart does a fantastic job as Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Im assuming thats no spoiler. If you dont know Harvey Dent is\nTwo-Face, then you shouldnt care about my review in the first place). Eckhart makes for an excellent pretty boy DA who\nhas real thoughts and real qualms about Gordon and Batman, and his transition to Two-Face is startling. Its hard for\nthe audience to hate him as Two-Face after we loved him as Harvey Dent. Christian Bale does some fantastic work with the\nBatman persona and the Bruce Wayne persona. Both have added depth and weaknesses which are addressed. The methodical\ndetective that I have come to love about the Batman is more evident in The Dark Knight, as are the repercussions for\nsuch a life. In one scene, Bale removes his shirt, showing a series of scars all over his back. That really helps to\nshow the hard life Batman leads. The only negative side is I dont care for the raspy voice Bale uses for Batman. I know\nBale has to change his voice and make it menacing, and there are limits to the vocal abilities of a man, but when Batman\nis involved in lengthy dialog is seems evident Bale is having trouble with the voice. As for the story, the plot is\nsurprisingly the main focus. This is not a comic book movie that has you waiting for the big fight scene, the plot is\nactually rather complex. There are a lot of elements of movies like The Godfather and The Untouchables which add depth\nto the story. When The Dark Knight ends, you dont feel like everything has been resolved and everything is going to be\nOK. Its almost upsetting, the way the movie treats these comic book characters so realistically. When Bale lifts his\nshirt revealing all those scars, thats how everyone ends up when the credits roll. Remember how the sequels to Pirates\nof the Caribbean decided to add complexity to the plot and ended up making the whole thing such an incomprehensible mess\nin those 2 1/2 hours? The Dark Knight does not do that. All of the plot lines are kept in order and there is very little\nquick explanations. One thing about the movie that I enjoyed was the realism of the action. There was no crazy kung-fu\nor spectacular acrobatics involved. The fighting was kept very realistic. Actually, the way the Joker fought was just as\ncreepy as his acting. \"Youve changed things... forever. Theres no going back.\" I think when Nolan wrote that line it\nwas more for himself. See, this movie is different. Its not a movie about superheroes fighting super villains. Its\nrough and gritty and you come out feeling a little disturbed. I think this movie is going to be much like Frank Millers\nThe Dark Knight Returns, a new age of realism and adult themes in these movies. I would like any adult friends of mine\nto see this film, but keep the kids out. The Dark Knights PG-13 rating should be R. This isnt like Saturday morning\ncartoons.",

    "reviewBody": "When i witnessed the hype of The Dark Knight rising and all the images of Heath Ledgers joker and the campaign posters\nfor Eckharts Dent Portrayal i thought only one thing. This could be one of those great sequels, you know the ones that\noverpower the original with acting and style, letting the depth of character overtake the explosions and bigger/better\nmentality of most sequels. (for example see, Godfather part 2, Empire Strikes Back etc)After watching it i was proved\nright. First off. Making the Batman franchise a crime epic is a sure fire way of hooking in an audience, the level of\nstyle mixed with the origin of Batman, a dark inner turmoil character bent on making the future of a city a little bit\nbrighter, and then pitting him against crime boss and a maniac hit-man. This gives the movie a brilliant storyline.\nThen the storyline is flipped on its head for having the Harvey Dent character become Batmans way out from all the\nwrong things that went with his path. (such as copycat innocent folk getting killed and vigilante justice not being as\nsweet as it seems). The direction is as if Nolan was watching Heat and other Michael Mann flicks off set and taking that\nstyle, theres no definitive comic book feel to it, its just pure grit. The best thing about The Dark Knight is the\nhaunting Heath Ledger, every scene hes in there is no way you can take your eyes off of him. until Two Face comes in,\nthen its a whole different story entirely. I just want to give a mention to the opening scene, it sets up a pure crime\nsaga start and then later theres a scene that cannot be missed by any lover of great tracking shots. Im annoyed i\ncouldnt have witnessed it in an Imax theatre. The Dark Knight is what comic book movies should have been, dark, moral,\nand entertaining as all hell. Theres a little disbelief to be suspended, but who cares. One of the greatest sequels of\nmovie history.",

    "reviewBody": "In 2005, Christopher Nolan with a very committed and talented cast and crew set out to make an amazing crime noir film\nthat was gestured to remaining true to the values of artistic and quality cinema, whilst committing to mass-commercial\nappeal by incorporating a famed character from the DC Comics franchise and honouring a darker, grittier, intense and\nmature rendition of a Graphic Novel theme with Batman Begins. The result was one that received mass acclaim and\ngenerated a feeling throughout film-goers everywhere that this was a Comic Book tie-in film that was, unanimously, a\nforce to be reckoned with - a total triumph! - with a complete rollicking epic story, interesting characters, memorable\nmoments, justified action and responses to a situation that one man - with an ideal - could change\nthings...Forever...Now theres no going back...Introducing The Dark Knight - following the events of Batman Begins,\nwe now find Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) pushed to his limits emotionally, physically and especially ethically under the\nseverity of a new force of criminal in town... a man with no rules and no response to authority... a man who quite\nsimply, is in it for kicks and would gladly watch the world burn in a blaze of white hot chaos... a man who is as\nmysterious as the smile on his face - The Joker (Heath Ledger in an amazing, potential Oscar blazing final\nperformance). The Joker only has one real ambition and that is to satisfy his ego by killing the Batman and hopefully,\nalong the way, allowing him to unveil his identity to the world... he will do whatever it takes to destroy Gothams\ngreatest vigilante, even if it means that he destroys everything (including himself) in process. This is the main\nchallenge to The Dark Knight - do I become one of them to stop this ultimate evil? Or do I persevere? Let them hate me\nfor not giving in and going against all I stood for? What I deem right over wrong? When is too far... too far?\n...Incorporate an amazing, complex plot with all the trimmings of crime epic, interesting flawed characters, an evil\nthat is, somewhat, sympathetic and ethical issues that will have you questioning the The Dark Knight himself... even\nthough you know the answer... it is one of the most satisfying and intense films ever made, quite simply, brilliant! The\nperformances from the support cast including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent (who renders an amazing character in\nTwo-Face), Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth - the voice of reason, Morgan Freeman - as Lucius Fox - an inventor of\ngreat intelligence and moral grounding, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes - the conflicting love interest and Gary\nOldman as Commissioner Jim Gordon (in a well-rounded and an amazing performance) as Batmans greatest ally, they all\nwork well within their roles and add to the drama and the emotional impact that this film needs to rise it well above\njust ordinary...This is perhaps, the most anticipated film of the year, and believe me, it was worth every painful\nmoment of consistent waiting...For those who are curious to know if questions are answered, you may be surprised - I\nwont give anything away! For the sceptics, believe me - trust the hype on this one - it will not disappoint! This is\none of the most well-rounded, action-packed, justifiable and memorable films ever made! Go see it and actually\nexperience a film once again... Its such a great feeling! RATING: 9.5 / 10",

The muscular storytelling, intense action, impeccable production, direction,\nand the ensemble cast, are all on their best game. Ledger is a revelation. Arguably, its his best performance, and the\nperformance of the year. His Joker will live on as the most vital villain to hit the big screen in years and for many,\nmany more years to come. The magnitude of the finale in Knight is emotionally deep, haunting and inspiring. \"The Dark\nKnight\" will rattle the senses and linger in your thoughts long after.",

    "reviewTitle": "Stand up and applaud the Joker...",
    "reviewBody": "This is a movie that goes beyond a lone superhero fighting comic book villains in a fictional city. Its a brilliantly\ndirected masterpiece that will leave you gasping and starring at the screen when the credits roll. Like the first movie\nChristian Bale brings his strong persona to the billionaire Bruce Wayne who uses Batman as a symbol to bring justice in\nGautham.However this movie isnt just about Batman, its also centered around someone else, someone far more complicated\nand dark. The Joker.Nolan and the late Heath Ledger give the Joker a dimension I have never seen before in a villain.\nLedgers performance is nothing short of brilliant, breathtaking and aw-inspiring; almost as if he is drawing upon the\ndemons within himself to portray the Joker. He is the most believable villain I have ever seen on the Big Screen and he\nwill scare you from the first time he appears in the movie. As brilliant as Christian Bale is in the movie he is\nover-shadowed by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Every time the Joker is on screen the movie has a feeling of its own. It\nmoves away from being an action flick based on a comic and becomes something much more dramatic and complex. Like Batman\nyou get lost trying to figure out the joker and reason behind his demented personality and his haunting crimes. If Heath\nLedger doesnt get an Oscar for this role I dont know who will.Other supporting actors also provide strong\nperformances. Aaron Eckhart is very good as Harvey Dent/Two face and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as always do a\ngreat job as well. The only week link in this movie for me was Maggie Gyllenhaal, like Katey Holmes in Batman Begins she\ndoesnt quite hit the nail on the head.Nothing I can say in this short review will give you the true idea of how good\nthis movie is or what its is really about. Its so much more that any of the previous Batman movies. Its a perfect\nbalance of action, drama, suspense and quite brilliant acting and direction. This movie is a must see whether you are a\nBatman fan or not because the chances are that by the end of it, you will be standing and applauding.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Comic Book Movie Ever",
    "reviewBody": "Of course I have not seen every comic book movie. I know that but of all the movies I have seen, this is by far the\nbest. The dark side of this movie is so deep that at times it is hard to believe parents would take their 13-year-old\nkids to see this movie. Personally I would have nightmares if I was 13. Christian Bale pulls the batman role off\nperfectly. The joker leaves me speechless in every scene. There are no corny one-liners like you expect from a comic\nbook movie: this is not Iron Man or Spider Man (although I did enjoy Iron Man). This series is so much more serious and\ncreepier than the previous batman movies. Just looking at the Joker puts a chill down your spine. Seeing the events in\nthe movie are enjoyable for everyone, you dont have to be a fan of the batman comics or comic books to include this\nmovie in your all time favorites. I am not going to give Heath Ledger pity points. I have been excited about him playing\nthe Joker since they announced it and he has lived up to my expectations and far surpassed them. I would not take your 7\nyear old boy to see this movie. PG-13 in this case means it. Heath Ledgers character is far scarier than any comic book\nvillain I have ever seen. The dark parts of this movie make it unbelievable. Perhaps this is my personality speaking; my\nfavorite album of all time is \"The Downward Spiral\" by Nine Inch Nails; but after seeing this movie Wednesday night I\nwent home and listened to the entire album (not going to bed until past 5 am). When the credits start rolling and you\nsee it read \"In memory of our friends Heath Ledger and Conway Wickliffe\" it hits you that Ledger is dead. This is his\nbest performance (excluding \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\") and it makes you realize how brilliant he was and\nwhat a loss it is for him to be gone. But dont go into the movie with that on your mind. Enjoy the movie. I did. Is it\nmy favorite movie of all time? No. But it is definitely in my top five.",

The summer started off with some great superhero movies with the exception of Hancock, Iron Man and the\nHulk were very well made so it only seems right that Batman would rock the house and set a new standard for superhero\nmovies. What I like about the Dark Knight is that is humanizes batman and sheds light on the difficulties and traumas of\nbeing mortal and human unlike Super man or Spider man, Batman and Iron Man are just men which makes the stories and\nmovies so relate-able and believable to a certain extent.",

The Oscar talk surrounding his\nperformance is well deserved. Bale is superb as Batman and even better as Wayne. Caine,Oldman and Freeman are at the top\nof their game. But the steal of the film for me was Aaron Eckhardt. His performance as Harvey Dent is brilliant. I dont\nwant to spoil anything here - just a truly masterful film - along the lines of The Departed and Heat. 10 out of 10.",

    "reviewBody": "DARK KNIGHT 1st of all, I must admit that my expectation on TDK was high. In fact very high. Here my reviews............\nTHIS FILM WAS SERIOUSLY INTERPRETING IN DEPTH THE DARKEST SIDE OF BATMAN WORLD IN PARALLEL TO THE TAGLINE!! which\nanswered the question \"WHY SO SERIOUSSSSSS? ONE Thing and without doubt,THE Oscar GOES TO......................... OUR\nLATE HEATH LEDGER!!!!!!!I was so surprised with the opening 5 minutes, which defines JOKER characters in the film. And\nvery impressed with JOKER(Ledger) character as scarily psychotic plus sadistically maniac villain. Ledger stealing every\nscene he appears in and truly convince us that he was the perfect actor to play that roles. Damn!!! I ended seeing JOKER\nface in my mind when I woke up this morning and every time I think about TDK. Forget about Jack Nicholson!! Ledger: Best\nperformance in his life. So sad Heath ended with this as his last film. Bale did great but not good as he performed in\nBatman Begins. Maybe the focus in this sequel is to the TWO FACE AND JOKER. GORDON(GARY), LUCIUS(FREEMAN) was great\ntruly play their part very well. RACHEL(MAGGIE GYLLENNHAAL)AND HARVEY(ECKHART) was averaged. ECKHART expression change\nwhen he plays darker side in which he really delivered. THE ACTION and MOMENTUM was excellent and really brilliant\nespecially at the middle. Almost forgot about BATPODS....It was really stunning and awesome. Moved in fast-pace Nolans\nproved that he can do it twice for this comic adaption movies. Its hard to direct superheroes action sequel without\ntaking consideration the story from the comic itself and to disregard Batman die-hard fans. To me, Nolan succeeded.\nALTHOUGH, it was 2 and half hours, sometimes it was rushing especially at the end. PLUS, something must be wrong with\nscripts or plots transition which interfered me. Maybe unessential parts should be short. And plot transition was not so\ntidy like BATMAN BEGINS. The ending was simple, sames as BB. There wasnt any plot twist at the ends that could make you\nForgettable. No applauds when the credit starts, maybe audience is still shock. If Ironman was fun, this one was well\nenjoyable and entertaining movies. Deserve, BEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER MADE. Ill be watching it for 2nd time this weekend\nand eagerly waiting for DVDs release date. TDK 9.49999/10!!!!!!!!!!",

James Gordon....Now Christian Bale, well he is great, he is a great actor, i love\nhis voice as Batman, its so different than Bruce Wayne voice. But, i think that in this movie he didnt came up to the\nscene to much, i mean like in the Batman Begins, cos in Batman Begins hes practically all the movie in scene. But this\nis because this movie is more focused in The Joker.My favorite Quote from the movie is::(The Joker to Batman)\"Youve\nChanged Things... Forever. Theres No Going Back. See, To Them, Youre Just A Freak... Like Me!\"A great movie.......very\nvery damn good!!!",

I am not a huge fan of comic\nbook movies with recent disasters such as Spider-Man 3 amongst others but this takes story telling, action, acting to a\nnew level for Comic Book Movies. This can be easily rated as the best comic book movie ever. Definitely need to watch\nthis movie in the cinemas. All awards for Heath Ledger coming from this movie will be justified. It will be an utter\nshock if he doesnt get best actor lead or supporting actor nod. I think he had more screen time that Batman itself and\nhe didnt disappoint.

And the story turning him to Two-Face is brilliant, even comic is not better than this. Gary\nOldman playing Gordon suits him as how it was in Batman Begins. Eric Roberts, nothing new for him playing\nmafia.Christopher Nolan proved that super hero movie does not necessary to be action all the way, but a lot of values\ncan be seen here. Just name it drama, action, thriller and moral values you can find it all here.I think this will be\nthe first comic Super Hero movie to win Oscar for best picture and lead roles.Bravo!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Why So Serious? When You Can Smile Because The Dark Knight Is Here And Because It Is Fantastic",
    "reviewBody": "When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burtons Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with\nthat tape), a 1989 film that I havent watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for\nJack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker\nmakeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack\nNicholson about the \"new\" joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he\nshould have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I\nsaw The Dark Knight, on a midnight \"special\" screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories\nof Nicholsons joker, I really dont remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledgers joker on the screen; he\nis absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolans Batman, the second take and definitely my\nfavourite of all the Batman films. Ledgers joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are\njust waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is\nthe joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of\nGotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement\n(the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one\nin who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City\nbut at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in\nthis way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since\nI only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of\nGotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And\nthe joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable\nin the film; I loved that the jokers origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and\nmaybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is\nnot very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level \"regular\" persons and he\nsucceeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because\nof his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation.\nOn this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty\nand the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I\nwrite before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write\nbefore too, the jokers movements are just to follow and even we you dont expect anything he puts to the civilians the\nclown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is\nkind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all\nthe performances in this film with only one word: great (I didnt missed Holmes and Im glad that Christian Bale, Morgan\nFreeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again).The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the\nunique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the\nfirst minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight\nscreenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and\nthat there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer.\nIm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film\never. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly\nfantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Dont miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!",

    "reviewTitle": "Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, all hit it out of the park",
    "reviewBody": "I wasnt sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a\nremake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not\nTwo-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole\n\"Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance\" hype, I didnt want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real\n\"origin\" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how\ncould it be any better than Nicholsons Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though its dependent on the universe\nthat director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledgers Joker wouldnt work in Burtons style, as his mix of camp and\nseriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolans world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To\nget it out of the way for this review, Ill say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth\nand strange, and not like ones used to (the slashes through his face are \"jokingly\" referenced that \"my dad did this,\n\"my wife did this\"), and hes totally ambiguous. But its also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only\ntopped probably in the craziest of the comics. Hes an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batmans\nprotect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. Its basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While\nthis should make the Joker boring, theres nothing that Nolan isnt willing to do to make the audience jump or second\nguess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible\ndouble-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledgers performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which Im\nstill not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is\nminuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance thats even better than Ledgers (or, rather,\nhe has a lot more complexity than \"Im gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here\"). He puts in everything thats needed\nfor the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man whos the \"white knight\", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman\nas the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say\nEckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his\nlatter reincarnation is some of the best Ive ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for\nthe Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolans vision being epic and grand, and for the most\npart pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions,\ngoes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the\nexposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if\nnot realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in Begins. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon,\nDent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and were pulling for them and\ncare about what happens all the way. Its all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how\nthings will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking \"say it isnt so\", and when I knew I was had, I\nknew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it\nand how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledgers death, and the new characters, and some of\nthe hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering\ndrama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded\nadmirably. It might not be the same amount of pure \"fun\" of Burtons films, but then again it doesnt need to be. Its\nan excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.",

I was slightly skeptical, but still highly anticipating film and\nmy expectations were very high. Well they were met and exceeded. I have to agree with those reviews comparing it to The\nEmpire Strikes Back. It is that equivalent to the superhero genre. The overtones are darker than Batman Begins, which\nwas a great stepping-stone for this incredible and epic storytelling of two masterful nemeses for Batman, The Joker and\nTwo-Face. However, the film did not get lost in the dark and still holds a great sense of humor to alleviate much of the\npain of the film.To begin with, Batman is having troubles carrying over from the first film. The narrows was lost and he\nis still trying to collect the criminals who escaped including Scarecrow / Jonathan Crane in small cameo appearance,\nwhich really was only weak point of the film. For a villain given so much story time in the first film, it felt\ndisappointing to see him carelessly tossed aside here as he was at the end of Begins. I digress on that, matter though\nas it is overall a minor disappointment. As he is finishing business with Scarecrow it also shown, that Batman has\ninspired others to follow him in his \"vigilante\" activities. He is not pleased at this. It is not what he intended when\nhe donned the mask. However, the vigilantes inspired by him are not the real beef.The Joker and first the mob is the\nfirst beef. Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon are cracking down on the mob hard forcing them to launder their money to\none man. Pounding them into a corner, this proves most deadly for a city already having major problems. Into this deadly\nnet waltz the ultimate in chaos theory. The Joker, a mad hatter and the anti-thesis of Batman, who not only follows not\nrules, but also has no qualms about doing what Batman will not, kill and kill without remorse. He is a mad man and\nsadistic and still one the enigma he is from the comics, something that Jack Nicholson had ruined for him back in 1989.\nUnlike him, Heath Ledger is aloud to play the role savagely and therefore, cannot be compared to Nicholsons lighter\nJoker. He is unto a class all his own in the Batman universe. Anarchy and madness that is what Ledger plays Joker as and\ndeftly too, as advertised a complete screwball whose actions have no rhythm and no bounds. He is the showman of the\nfilm, but overblown. Still one cannot help but laugh with him as the film goes up to the point when he kills.While Joker\nplays the villain of the film, the film offers three main lead heroes whom through the course of the film are tested to\ntheir limits by the Joker bound by none. There is the incorruptible Batman, the stalwart James Gordon, and the newcomer\nDistrict Attorney Harvey Dent. All played just as well as Ledgers Joker making the film are a fantastic film to watch\nas the four men butt heads. Individually they do it with the Joker as well as together. It is the heart and soul of the\nfilm. The three heroes most especially Harvey Dent represent the goodness of Gotham. That is something that is tried to\nthe edge by the Joker. It is through the performances of Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart that the film\nflourishes dramatically.Extraneously on the side, there is the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Rachel Dawes, and\nHarvey Dent, but only alongside the main one of the heart of the city and the triangle of Batman, Gordon, and Dent.\nAbove all Gotham is what must survive and that is what Joker makes at stake as much as Ras al Ghul did in Begins.\nTherefore, the love story takes a back seat, but it is not overlooked in the 2 hours and 40 minutes that the film runs.\nIt covers a lot of ground with lots of twists and turns and it does not miss a beat and way to tie up a loose end, save\nfor Cillian Murphys ever suffering Scarecrow.The technical makeup of the film is equally as stunning as the film story\nand makes it astounding strong in all respects. Add to that the perfect melding of countless comics and portrayals in\nthe performances here and the film falls into place as the pinnacle the Batman film series has to offer to date.",

He pulled off what the great Jack Nicholson wished\nhe could and dont get me wrong, Jacks performance was great but Ledger made me forget while watchin the movie that\ngood ole jack ever played the joker before..

    "reviewTitle": "A dark vision almost perfect",
    "reviewBody": "While I write this Im still immensely impressed with the forcefulness of this film, there are really few action or\nadventure movies that will create what \"The Dark Knight\" gets in just a few minutes, and that is to bring the climax of\nemotions with a script that is strengthened in each of its lines and with an edition that frame after frame doesnt\nexist any wastage. Anything that we had heard about this film before its premiere, all these positive comments that the\ncriticism launched after having seen it, all the positive references are true, very true. To begin with, the action\nsequences are a visual choreography, in each ones emotions are as much as possible, because not only are loaded by a\nperfect use of special effects, explosions and an audio editing forceful, but also because Bale, and Heath Ledger above\nall, build two characters who represent two sides of the coin and their clashes are so catastrophic that makes\neverything a witness from the edge of the seat. And is that really the performances are at the level of what anyone\ncould expect, but definitely this is the film of The Joker. Either that, including me, thought that no one could deprive\nthe best interpretation of this murderer to Jack Nicholson, really we have our mouths open to the strength, vitality and\nterror that manages to combine Ledger villain in this, I confess at times was too crazy up to me, and that is what\nsucceeds, it succeeds really that you think that this man is a man without any kind of moral questioning, everything for\nhim is a macabre game. So Joker works well because it also has a dramatic, dark and vertiginous screenplay that unfolds\nquickly to each of the characters and at the same time, for that speed with which everything happens, forcing the viewer\nto be attentive to each of the sequences, each of the planes, and the richness of this script is that even if it is full\nof action is also an ode about a moral antihero, that make you think about the various faces of good and evil, and leads\nto comic character to a much more psychological level, reflected whenever Joker and Batman exchange lines, and which\nculminates with a hopeful end even when circumstances suggest quite the opposite and balance between the two sides of\nthe coin has been broken. Thats because the script is really something worthwhile, for all Batman, The Joker, Harvey\nDent and James Gordon mean and represent. The film is not an idealistic and beautiful portrait of a hero, is a dark film\nabout a man who loads a weight of being a hero that nobody wants, is the battle of a man in front of the chaos, is the\nfascination of anarchy and violence and hope that lies even after the cataclysm. Yes, it has its errors of continuity,\nsome holes in the plot, but not all opaque this marvelous film. This is a great film in a genre in which there seemed no\nroom for maturity, for the visual beauty that has made the best Batman film.",

    "reviewTitle": "Oh sweet merciful Lord, that there can actually be sequels that surpass the originals",
    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie, just last night, at an advanced screening for the theater. I was not terribly looking forward to it\ninitially because I figured it was just another Batman movie. Yes, Christopher Nolan was directing it and he also\ndirected the movie that renewed my faith in the Batman series (Batman Begins), but it was just another sequel in my\nmind. wait for it to come to DVD, I thought. So my friend got me a free ticket to this screening and I went. All I can\nsay is this (and I am not exaggerating): It Is THE Best Superhero Movie EVER. A true psychological thriller, Nolan\nslowly builds the suspense, terror and madness each minute you watch. At first, Oh sure its the Joker. Biiig deal, he\nkills some of his own henchmen. But gradually, the diabolical mind behind the clownface emerges (demonstrated absolutely\nflawlessly by the late Heath Ledger). Batman, played by Christian Bale, is as dark and brooding as he was in Begins. His\ngadgetry and the quality of his costume is improving, but he is also gaining admirers in some strange places as\nsmall-time criminals begin to emulate him--something he refuses to accept, they ARE criminals after all. Bales\nportrayal is perfect. Vengeful anti-hero by night, Billionaire jackass by day. In this movie, he is charged with\ncleaning up the mob from the Gotham City streets. Utilizing the legal powers of Dent and Gordons access to city\nofficials, he does this, clearing Gotham of the scum in one magnificent swoop. Hooray for our hero. Fortunately, the\nmovie does not end there. A string of deaths occurs, all masterminded by the same diabolical villain and Batman makes it\nhis personal quest to rid the world of the Joker. As people begin to blame him for the mounting hysteria, Bruce Wayne\nbegins to falter. Drawing into himself, he tries to shoulder the responsibility onto Dent more and more. But Dent has a\nweakness, the same one Bruce does. And when she dies, with Dent listening over a radio, it is the final straw breaking\nfor him. Maggie Gylenhaal portrays the role of Rachel Dawes, thankfully, grabbing it from the poor acting of Katie\nHolmes. Rachels role is fairly minor, unfortunately, but there really is no back story to her. Not in the comic anyway.\nWhile Gylenhaal is there, she plays a much better Rachel than Holmes...though that is not saying much. Aaron Eckhardt, a\nman I almost immediately recognized from his role as the main character of \"Thank You For Smoking\", plays the White\nKnight of Gotham, D.A. Harvey Dent. This is a man destined to plummet into the depths of complete and utter insanity,\nas the villain Two-Face. Everyone in the theater saw it coming when he did. That doesnt take away from Eckhardts\nportrayal of the driven Dent, who allies with Batman and James Gordon to rid Gotham City of the Mob. He is equally\nmagnificent in his fall. I never forgave Tommy Lee Jones for destroying my vision of Two-Face in Batman Forever...but\nthere were a lot of mistakes in that movie. I digress. Two-Face may be a psychotic, but he is NOT a giggling, twerpy\npsychotic. He retains Dents drive and powerful charisma. Eckhardt and Nolan flesh this out beautifully. But all of this\npales in comparison to Heath Ledgers Joker. The movie may be about Batman, but it is the Jokers movie, without\nquestion. I had always felt that Jack Nicholsons portrayal of the Joker was done well. It was cartoonish to Ledgers\nmaniacal villain. From the outset, as he so deviously states, he is out to \"send a message.\" The message is that anyone\nin this \"sophisticated\" society that we cling to can fall to his depths with just the right push. His very demeanor was\nso creepy and so histrionic that it had everyone in the theater on the edges of their seats. And he wins, in spades, as\nhe finds a way of turning Gothams \"greatest hope\" and the man Batman sees as his public face, into something similar to\nhim. Ledger, for those two and a half hours, is the embodiment of the chaos of the Joker. He captivates. It may be the\nmost incredible bit of acting I have ever seen.But dont take my word for it. Go see the movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman Triumphant!! The Caped Crusader soars above and beyond all its predecessors!",
    "reviewBody": "Warning!! ( Many spoilers)First Tim Burton directed two films opening the legacy. Next, Joel Schumacher continued two\nmore films, but for lesser quality. Now Chris Nolan has made \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight,\" something to\ntreasure forever.There are three things that won me over with this movie. First, this film pushes the envelope to a near\nR-Rating. There so much gunfire, explosions, and gruesome images that I felt tensed of what would happen next. I love\nmovies that take risks because if more movies exercised play-safe techniques, we would be watching \"Batman and Robin\"\nall over again. Second is Heath Ledgers brilliant performance. Although less comical, ledgers character is realistic,\nmenacing, and truly horrifying. A true psychopath, which Ledger brings so much realism. Even if there is no posthumous\nOscar nomination, Ledger will most definitely live on as a movie legend. Not a single online hater complaining about the\nfilms length, darkness, or complex story can take away Ledgers status. Finally the third thing is the film has\nfirst-rate storytelling. There is a surprise twist and a nail-biting action sequence at every corner. The action is also\nevenly balanced with the plot and characterization. Its more than just a good v.s. evil film. There is real conflict and\nreal turmoil that plays on both sides of law enforcers and law violators. The film concerns Batman/Bruce Wayne trying to\nmake the city a better place. while crooks and copycat vigilantes run amok, the Joker associates himself with powerful\ncrime bosses. Through countless terrorist attacks, the Joker commands the citizens of Gotham to do whatever he wants as\nlong as he controls their fears and emotions. Sometimes there is no clear motive or explanation about the Jokers past,\nbut he wants to unmask Batman and try to make him appear villainous in the face of Gotham. The Joker is anything but a\ntwo-dimensional villain. He had a conflicted childhood just like Bruce, but he uses his angst, his rage, and his\nemotions to hurt others rather than protect them. Bruce Wayne on the other hand soon wants to hang up his Batman suit\nand settle with his love Rachel Dawes, since DA Harvey Dent is leading a revolution against all citywide crime. That is\nuntil later, when Harvey Dent makes a transformation into the monstrous Two-Face. Who is just as scary and sinister as\nthe Joker. From that moment onward its a crazy roller coaster ride of thrills, unpredictability, and tragedy.Although\nthe movie is long, there is sharp editing, outstanding performances, great stunt work, a superb script, and enough\nmemorable moments to make the 2.5 hours zip by. A MOVIE MASTERPIECE.",

Most of this comment is\nabout Heath Ledger so let me start by giving Christian Bale and the rest of the awesome cast, director,make-up,special\neffects team, writers, producers, and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in, and on this movie.Now for\nLedger. People can say what they want about Heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it\njust isnt true. Alive or gone, this was the performance of a lifetime. The make-up, the laugh, the mannerisms, every\nlittle thing he did was perfect. I have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. I\nlove Jack Nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive, but I am sorry Jack because Heath Ledger just out shined\nyou and that is not easy to do.I was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have\njust been too symbolic and I would have lost it. I did cry at the end though. The ending when two face, the commissioner\nand batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled\nHeath Ledgers untimely passing.It is completely unfair that Heaths family and the world are going to miss out on such\nan amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent I have ever seen. I am a single mother and I cant even\nbegin to imagine losing my daughter, so my heart goes out to Heaths family and his daughter.

    "reviewTitle": "An excellent followup to Batman Begins",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight was a very good follow up to Christopher Nolans first batman film Batman begins. I watched this last\nnight and enjoyed it pretty much but it didnt really blew me away as compared to Tim Burtons version of Batman. I\nenjoyed it particularly because of the acting, music, atmosphere which were phenomenal. I gave it 8 stars because I\nwasnt really into this whole \"dark\" batman thing and Jack Nicholsan as Joker was deeply etched in my memory ever since\nI watched it when I was only 6. The movie started of with a bang with Joker(Heath Ledger) as he robs a bank and killing\nhis accomplices one by one so which led him to leaving with the entire amount of money robbed that day. Joker wasnt\nactually in need of the money, he was robbing mainly for the thrill of it as could be seen later in the movie when he\nburns down a mountain of cash. Heath ledger did an amazing job as acting the downright evil, corrupt, insane, psychotic\nnemesis of batman as he goes all out his way against what batman upholds: justice, even to the point where he made\nHarvey Dent aka half-face( Aaron Eckhart) a villain to Gotham city who was previously deemed as \"white knight\" of\nGotham. Comparing it to Jack Nicholsans rendition of Joker, Heath Ledgers version of Joker was more scary, evil and\nless funny which was similar to the later versions of the comic book.Besides Heath Ledger, the rest of the cast were\nexcellent. Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our Caped Crusader as he struggles between his 2 personalities of\nbeing a rich heir and an upholder of justice which also puts his relationship with Rachel Dawes on the rocks.Aaron\nEckhart also did an amazing job as \"white knight.\" His sense of justice was also what brought him and Rachel\nDawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) together. However, the loss of his love and with Jokers mind-playing, he was drove to insanity\nand became the villain that he would have previously hated. Aaron Eckharts portrayal of Harvey Dents as he struggles\nwith emotions, justice and insanity brought Half-face to another level.Maggie Gyllenhaal did great replacement for Katie\nHolmes as Waynes love interest Rachel Dawes, as she shows more sensitive and caring side towards Bruce but chose Harvey\nin the end. Michael Caine(Alfred) also delivered as the loyal butler who cares and took care of Bruce as well as Morgan\nFreeman(Lucius Fox), aiding Batman in the remake of his batsuit, batmobile and use of equipments and technology. Gary\nOldman( Lt. James Gordon) also deserves an applaud as Batmans sidekick and police officer as both track down Joker.In\nshort, this is probably one of the best 2008 films but not without its flaws. Firstly, there were too many characters\nfor the given time. Both Joker and Batman were supposedly the main cast but so was Harvey. I wished that he was given\nmore screen time as half-faced because the ending seemed a little rushed. There should be more acknowledgement to his\nrole. Secondly, there were times where I got confused as the film progresses and I couldnt understand the discussions\nbetween La(Chinese mobster)and Bruce as well as the significance of Jokers killings. True he killed them to lure out\nBatman but I couldnt understand why he chose them. I feel that this film will appeal to audiences of a larger age group\nor those who read the comics. Teenagers might find it hard to understand. I had problems with it initially but after the\nmovie, when I pieced everything together, then it started to make sense.",

    "reviewTitle": "Above any of the highest expectations",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan is the master storyteller of the new millennium. I havent seen any film of his that I could not give\na perfect rating to and The Dark Knight is no exception. Any bias toward comic book characters aside this is a\nmasterpiece of epic proportions. I recommend that those who hate comic books give it a see because The Dark Knight feels\nas authentic in human emotion as any drama could ever be.The anticipation for this film begins and ends with Heath\nLedger as the Joker and I must say it is an electrifying performance. If Ledger gets a nomination for Best Supporting\nActor at the Academy Awards it wont be out of pity, his Joker will easily be remembered as one of the most scary\nvillain in motion picture history. There is no limit to what this monster of a character is capable of and the audience\non the edge of their seat every time he is on screen because we know he will push the bar a little farther. I consider\nmyself to be well read in the Batman universe and I knew that they were basing a lot of the character here off of the\niconic Killing Joke and even I was left unprepared and aghast by what Ledger does. The Dark Knight is not for kids, hell\neven some smart adults will have to drop their jaws at what this Joker does. He is frightening, genuinely frightening.\nPraise most be given to Nolan as well because he is careful not to use too much of this Joker by over exploiting him\nwith excessive screen time, he gets the same amount of screen time as a lot of the ensemble cast but it is worth it. All\ntoo often are good villain killed by too much screen time and every time the Joker is on screen he is as fresh and scary\nas he was before. This Joker really is a great collaboration between the outstanding script and an actor who does\neverything exactly right with it.Ledger isnt the only great performance though. Every actor takes this material\nextremely seriously and there isnt a bad performance in this movie. In fact there are some career performances in here\nbesides for Ledgers, Aaron Eckhardt is outstanding as the tragic Harvey Dent. I was somewhat hesitant to the casting of\nEckhardt, he hasnt really impressed me in anything before but I couldnt imagine anyone doing more with this character.\nThe CGI used to create the Two Face character is somewhat fake looking but Eckhardt doesnt skip a beat when a lesser\nperformance would be overshadowed by Two-Faces visuals. Gary Oldman is given more to do as Jim Gordon and this\nperformance isnt just a notch in the belt for Oldman. He makes Gordon one of his most well rounded characters and one\nwho is as tested by the Jokers anarchy as Batman and Dent.The script brings Batman to brave new places. Bale is\nterrific in the lead role but the lead role is different than it was before. We have never seen Batman as dark in his\ncharacterization than he is in this film. Batman is pushed past his limits and he becomes darker in his methods and\nalong the way he loses the people he cares about. By the end of the film he is paranoid and uses his friend Lucius Foxs\ntechnology to spy on the people of Gotham to find the Jokers location. If The Dark Knight has a central theme it is\nthat of justice and Bruce Wayne comes to realize that he will be alone in his quest for justice. The Joker tries to make\nhis opponents more like him and he succeeds in turning Dent into the monster Two-Face but he also tests Batman. He\nquestions Batman about his one rule in his exploits and we know that if Batman kills the Joker he will become him. The\nJoker delivers the classic lines stating that the two complete each other and that they will end up carrying out their\nwar both not breaking who they are.CGI and the visuals often plague films like this and Nolan tries his hardest to make\nyou believe that this could happen in our world and for that I most praise him. The Dark Knight is a story drenched in\nhumanity and because of this Batman is the greatest superhero we have ever seen. Sure you could get bitten by a spider\nor build an Iron suit but that doesnt make you human. Batman is human and goes through hell in his crusade and for that\nhe is the greatest superhero.",

    "reviewBody": "This is a fantastic comic book/superhero movie - easily my favorite. The actors are very good, especially some of the\nminor roles. The action, gadgets - every staple of Batman Begins - is there in full force and better looking than ever.\nThe movie is gorgeous.The real highlight of this movie is Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker. Some might be under the\nimpression that all the talk and hype about his performance leading up to the theatrical release was because of his\nunfortunate early death. That impression, however, is definitely not accurate. Ledgers Joker is everything that was\nhyped and promised and then some. It is simply spectacular.Thanks in a large part to Ledger, Dark Knight is surprisingly\nemotional. There are parts that are (unsurprisingly) dark. But the mannerisms of the Joker and what he thinks and what\nhe says are extremely funny. He has the ability to instantly change the tone of a scene - something that Nolan used to\ngreat effect.My only real (but small) complaint is that there are a few problems with the otherwise strong story. Dark\nKnights plot does not seem as controlled as Batman Begins - the pacing of some sections is a little off. Also, Joker\nwas an agent of chaos, destroying others plans because he hates control, yet his actions were superbly planned - \"its\nall part of the plan.\" This criticism may be superficial, but theres no need to get into the deeper philosophy of the\nmovie here other than to say it is engaging and fun.In short, if you love good action with a good story with great\nacting, this is definitely a must see. Ledgers performance is fantastic - in my opinion, it deserves piles of\nawards.10/10",

    "reviewBody": "Just got back from seeing this, I was originally going to see it after the w/e, but I was bored today so I watched\nBegins, then I had to go see this as soon as I could.There is very little thats bad with this movie. The acting, the\npacing, the score (including the levels at which it played at the suitable times), the lack of CGI messing up scenes, a\nMUCH better Rachel Dawes, it goes on....quite a bit. But what would be the point of repeating such praise again and\nagain in these IMDb user comments.The only things that I didnt dig so much, and this one goes for Begins as well, is\nthat Gotham City doesnt look right. Pretty much the only thing Burton did right was gotham city (and I also liked the\nway he portrayed its inhabitants), I do have a feeling that it was done as to not mirror the Burton films though. Also\nTwo Face actually becoming fully bad couldve been kept until the third movie too. It wouldve gone really well with the\nwhole flow of the saga, because unlike ALL other (superhero) comic book film adaptions, the villains carry on and the\nfilms are linked by them. Its not just new villain who dies at the end, because thats not how the comics work. So yeah,\nhe couldve just crawled from the wreck after he shot the driver, and left the audience unsure of what exactly happened\nto him.Ill have to wait and see how it flows into the third installment though, it may end up working really well.I\nliked the way you expected the BatCave, but it wasnt there, which again adds to the flow of the saga....I like the fact\nthat the batmobile was destroyed, so hopefully theres a new design for three cos I really disliked this Batmobile\neven though it sounded awesome.Ill have to see it again to make up my mind on the, sonar phone watching centre. Not\nbecause of the plausibility of it, but more-so the morality. I need to see if Batman was pained by having to do that,\nbecause in my opinion, loss of civil rights/human rights is much much worse then death. The scene seemed to say that if\nits necessary, its necessary which is blergghh. They couldve just had all the phones in Gotham being monitored, but\njust by audio, had a continuous track on the Jokers voice print (which are much more unique then fingerprints) and then\nfor it to come up only when it was found, and then only on that call as to not destroy individuals privacy.Even with all\nthe negatives I mentioned it still deserves a 9.5 . God I wish you could give half points, I want to give many things\nhalf points.....10 perhaps if it wasnt for the phone issue, but yeah. Great film.9/10(Reviewed after first viewing)",

    "reviewBody": "So this movie has been mega-hyped and I did see it on opening day. I enjoyed it, though Im not sure Id sit through it\nagain. First, the positive points. There is nice eye-candy for the female movie-goer in Bale and Eckhart. The\nperformances all around are stellar. Obviously, Ledgers Joker is amazing. I personally found it to be one of the best\nperformances Ive seen in an actor (this may be ironic but I found it as chilling as Nicholsons role in The Shining).\nHe was superb and I found myself waiting for the scenes in which he would reappear. I also though Gary Oldman did some\nvery nice work. His performance was restrained in the right places and emotionally wrought in others. Eckhart and Caine\nwere really terrific in their roles as well. Freeman played the same character he always does and that was fine. Maggie\nGyllenhaal was unwatchable. Horrible acting on a horribly written character. And I dont mean to be rude, but she is way\ntoo homely looking for the viewer to believe uber-hotties would be lusting after her. She was terrible.The negatives:\nThe movie is way too long. I found it uncomfortably long. Bales Batman voice grated on my nerves. I appreciate the\nintensity and artistic style of this movie, but it just wasnt a whole lot of fun. It was dark, heavy, brooding, and a\nbit depressing. Recommended but not loved.",

    "reviewTitle": "Entertaining, but NOT a masterpiece. Uh-uh. Not by a longshot.",
    "reviewBody": "Wow. Cant believe how high the rating is for this film on IMDb. Did we all see the SAME film?? Wow.Okay, just got back\nfrom seeing this, and I gotta say, I was very, very disappointed. Overall, the movie had its moments, but maaaan oh\nmaaaan, was this movie WAY TOO LONG. And unnecessarily so. So far, Christian Bale has proved to be a satisfying Batman,\nbut NO ONE has lived up to my vision of what Batman should truly be up on the big screen. That said, lets move on.THE\nVIEWING EXPERIENCE: The WORSE PART about this movie for me was the editing. It was unforgivably choppy. Too many scenes\nended too abruptly and I guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of\n\"GAPING PLOT HOLES\". THE ACTION: Very intense from the beginning which was great, but the movie peetered out toward the\nend. That whole scene with Harvey Dent holding Gordons family hostage was just way too long and too over the top.\nDents transformation into evil happened too quickly, which made his descent into \"Bat-Villain\" unconvincing. It was\nlike he was having a very bad tantrum, thats all. He needed to be spanked or hugged. Nope. Despite what you may read,\nthere wasnt ANYTHING poetic about it. Sorry, Freudians. COOLEST SCENES: I really liked the confrontation scene at the\njail between Batman and The Joker. Great, great stuff. Batman was extremely close to \"losin it\" and I thought for a\nsecond he just may kill him, he just might snap and do it. But nah. Batman isnt nearly as amoral as ol Clown Face.\nAnother scene I liked was when Batman was in Hong Kong kickin some baddies asses, then he grabs the head honcho Asian\ndude(cant remember his name, sorry), launches some balloon thingy in the sky, hooks himself and the baddie to an\noncoming plane (which of course was all arranged...I wonder who was flying the thing? Lucius?) which takes off into the\nnight sky. That scene was TIGHT. Executed brilliantly. MOST MEMORABLE SCENES: The Joker making that pencil \"disappear.\"\nThe Joker walking away in a nurses uniform as bombs go off behind him. Classic. Those images will stay with me for a\nlong, long time.COOLEST TOY: The Batpod. Geeks will cheer.PERFORMANCES: Heath Ledger was good, yes. Did he give me\nchills and simply blow me away? Sadly, no. But perhaps I was expecting WAY TOO MUCH. After all, the buzz on his\nperformance as The Joker started way back in January. Does he deserve a posthumous Oscar? No. An Oscar nomination should\nmore than suffice for the \"kudos\" hes been getting. His death is what has swayed, or rather, \"manipulated\" people to\nsay this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen. Dont be so gullible. Its a good performance, dont\nget me wrong. But its not history making. However, Heath now makes Nicholsons Joker look as campy and as ridiculous as\nCesar Romero. Christian Bale had his moments; so did Aaron Eckhart. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch. Morgan\nFreeman and Michael Caine will always be veterans of their craft. Everyone else could have phoned it in.THE MUSIC: Not\nmemorable. And in some scenes, shrill and annoying. Where or WHERE is Danny Elfman? WHAT BUGGED ME THE MOST: Batmans\ngravelly, and super LOUD voice. It sounded completely ridiculous and over-amplified. Not menacing. Just ridiculous. I\nthought the script tried too hard to send a message. What we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly \"preachy\".THE\nENDING: A dud. Even though the movie was an agonizing 2.5 hours, I still felt something was missing. Batman being\n\"hunted down\" by Gordon and the GCPD was lame. The Nolan brothers shouldve written a much more satisfying ending. I\nfelt cheated. There was not enough of a satisfying denouement for The Joker. He was just left hanging there upside down,\ngiggling like a school girl on crack. They shouldve given The Joker a much more satisfying final scene. Like that last\nshot of Anthony Perkins in \"Psycho\", staring chillingly into the camera. Jokers exit should have been just as memorable\nand just as SCARY. What they gave us was WEAK. Pure and simple. And that really, really SUCKS since it was indeed\nHeaths final scene. His final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most. They couldve given him a better\ntribute than that. WHAT ID LIKE TO HAVE SEEN: The Joker being FUNNY. Come on, people! Thats what The Joker has ALWAYS\nbeen about. Not campy, but funny. Heaths interpretation of The Joker was nothing like in the comics. I understand the\nNolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that, but lets get real and stick to story origins, okay? The Joker is a\ndemented psychopath yes, but hes also supposed to be wickedly funny. You know, laughing at his own sick twisted humor.\nWe got NONE OF THAT from Heaths portrayal. What he played was a character who shouldve been named The Sicko. Or The\nMoney Burner. Or Chaos Man. In any case, the Nolan brothers, to me, failed to give us The Joker we all really wanted to\nsee. Again, I liked Heaths performance. I did. But there was still so much missing. OVERALL REVIEW: I was entertained\nby this film, but was sadly disappointed with the pacing, the editing and some of the gaping plot holes. And what sucks\nis that Im a HUGE Batman fan. HUGE!!! I SOOOO wanted this film to be a masterpiece, but it wasnt. Not by a longshot.I\nactually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars, but most of you made this movies rating on IMDb just unforgivably TOO\nHIGH.",

    "reviewTitle": "Oscar Worthy",
    "reviewBody": "One of the best films of the year. In 2005, I walked out of Batman Begins with a huge smile on my face! I could not wait\nfor this sequel.Batman Begins was everything I wanted in a Batman film, it had tons of action, superb acting and\ndirection, nifty camera work, and a story to tell. It was the Batman film I have been waiting for. Now this is probably\none of the best comic book superhero films of all time.As Kevin Smith said, it really is the Godfather Pt. II of comic\nbook films. The acting is its chief strength in this movie. Christian Bale is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne of all time,\nthank god Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes, and Heath Ledger god rest his soul. Ledger was the perfect Joker,\neven better than the great Jack Nicholson. Ledgers performance is so terrifying, and he brings depth, realism, and fear\nto his Joker. I really hope they give him an award. The film has a great supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as DA\nHarvey Dent, who becomes Two-Face, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordan, Michael Cain as Bruces trustworthy butler, and\nMorgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Christopher Nolan again will blow you away with this one, as he did in Batman Begins. The\naction scenes rock, and they dont look fake at all the stunts are amazing.The Dark Knight tops The Incredible Hulk and\nin a few ways tops Iron Man. I would say this is right next to Spider-Man 2 one of my personal favorites. This film is\ncompletely flawless, and it is one of the best films of 2008, and a movie you must see! Just like Spider-Man 2, The Dark\nKnight is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original in almost every way possible! The story is so well written,\nand the script just keeps the film going and moving in a good pace, and I was never bored with the sub-plots, or even\nthe love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent, and Rachel Dawes.The run time is long, but I must tell all who read\nthis review, that it is the fastest two-hour thirty-minute epic I have ever seen in a long time. Not a minute in this\nfilm I was thinking, oh they should have cut at least seven or eight minutes. This is an Oscar worthy film, I know the\nAcadmey will not give it any recognition, because they are just not fair. Like all those other superhero flicks that do\ndeserve nominations besides special effects, like Batman Begins, Spider-Man 2, X2:X-Men United, this years Iron Man, or\nmany, many other comic book flicks that are Oscar worthy.In closing The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, and will not\ndisappoint fans of Batman, and this is a comic book movie for non-comic book fans, and itll leave a lot of fan boys\nwanting more. I know I did, and I hope the third chapter of the Nolan series will come out soon, and top this one.",

He stole this movie away from the\npowerhouse Christian Bale - who never shone brighter than he did in Batman Begins - and the tremendous understated Gary\nOldman. Aaron Eckhardt is also a great talent and was a surprising treat as Harvey Dent. There was almost nothing wrong\nwith this film.But I think it was too long. At least, Im pretty sure it was.I honestly thought the show was over when\nthe Joker was apprehended the first time and was very satisfied with that ending. But it was only half way\nfinished.Dont get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the 2nd half, either. It was good storytelling, deeply\nthoughtful psychodrama, and filled with amazing action. So, why not make two movies out of it? Then we could have\nsavored the legacy of the late Heath Ledger that much more.",

    "reviewBody": "Before seeing the movie, I was ridiculously excited about it. I was hoping my expectations would be met... and in most\nrespects, they were. Its a very enjoyable, well-done movie. But there are things I think need to be different in order\nfor the movie to be perfect. Comparatively, Batman Begins feels like a more well thought out movie than The Dark Knight.\nIt had a much more focused point to it. The story was more personal and felt more real, I guess you could say. The Dark\nKnight almost takes on too much. Action is awesome. The visuals are amazing. Acting is top-notch. The actual production\nvalue of this movie is something to be in awe of. The only problems it has are the fault of the script. I think maybe it\nshould have gone through another draft or two. But, that being said, its definitely a very good movie. Heath Ledgers\nperformance is as great as we all knew it would be since the moment we first saw the trailers. *SPOILERS*My biggest beef\nwith the movie is the fact that there wasnt a huge showdown between Batman and the Joker like it looked like there\nwould be in the trailer. The first theatrical trailer ended with the Joker in the street saying \"Hit me!\", and then the\nbig low angle shot of Batman sliding past him on the Bat-Pod. I thought this would be the climax. Batman and Joker were\ngonna have a huge epic showdown in the streets of Gotham. It didnt turn out this way. Those shots were actually part of\na scene that comes about mid- way through the movie, and is actually over quite quickly after that. The climax that DOES\nhappen between Batman and Joker is considerably smaller on the edge of a building, and there isnt really anything all\nthat \"showdown\"-y about it. Perhaps they were saving the showdown for another movie... too bad they didnt know this was\nthe only film theyd get with Ledger as the Joker. But that bit of disappointment is nothing more than just my misguided\nexpectations, and I cant really blame the film for that. *END SPOILERS*So... all in all, I very much like the film. I\ndont quite love it like I thought I would... yet. Perhaps repeat viewing will get me more comfortable with the movie,\nand Ill love it. As of this moment, Im still a little uncomfortable with it.",

    "reviewBody": "Just saw the midnight release of The Dark Knight and I must say I was more excited to see this movie than any other\nmovie I have ever seen in theaters. Expecting a masterpiece in a comic book movie is crazy, I know, but a masterpiece is\nexactly what I got.First off, let me just say that the acting was PHENOMENAL! Christian Bale delivers another solid\nperformance as Batman, and we can now comfortably say that he is by far the best actor to ever play the role. At first I\nwas upset Katie Holmes did not come back for this movie but Maggie Gyllenhall does a fine job as Rachel. Caine, Oldman,\nand Freeman all do a great job as role characters, as they did in the first but the best acting was by two of the new\nguys.Aaron Eckhart as Two Face makes Tommy Lee Jones a figment of our imagination as he blows his performance out of the\nwater. But the real story of the night was Heath Ledger as The Joker. Sad to see him go, I am glad that he will be\nremembered not as a cowboy, but as The Joker. Every scene that he was in gave me the chills, as he perfectly portrayed\nthe psychopathic ways of The Joker and really helped you understand why he does the things he does. If he does not win\nan Oscar for his performance it will be a major disappointment.Last on the list is the Director. Christopher\nNolan(Batman Begins, The Prestige), yet again makes a brilliant movie. This movie though, is by far his best, and\nhopefully, he winds up with an Oscar for it. The only movie I know of that may compete is the new 007 movie, but I\npersonally dont even think it will come close as this movie, like a said before, is truly a MASTERPIECE. Well worth the\nridiculous $10 dollars I had to spend to see it and I recommend it to all audiences. 10 out of 10 stars!",

    "reviewBody": "First let me set the stage so you might better appreciate my perspective. I love movies. Its so easy for me to give 7s\nand 8s on movies. Mostly because I simply enjoy watching movies. But I very rarely give out 9s and have never given\nout a 10. This movie is a 10. I feel as if I need to downgrade past reviews as a result. lol I went into this movie with\nsome doubts. First I am a HUGE Jack Nicholson fan and was hoping nobody would ruin what I felt was a great last\nimpression of the Joker (played by Mr. Nicholson). I didnt have faith in Ledgers performance either. Cant say Im a\nfan of his. Not that I dont dislike him either but most of the movies he made I never really paid much attention to.\nCould care less about his Brokeback performance and felt he was becoming just another star they wanted to cram down our\nthroats.Dark Knight is AWESOME!! I completely loved Heath Ledgers performance. I felt he stole the show. He left no\nstone unturned. Makes the actor who played Scarecrow (from the first movie) look like a fool in my eyes. I was on the\nedge of my seat the entire film. The writing was brilliant. Writing was a 10!! The veteran actors were superb and added\nmuch to the film in their limited roles. I will see Dark Knight again. I will own a copy of this film. There is no doubt\nin my mind that Ledgers performance in this film would have shot him straight to the top of the charts, even higher\nthan before. Thank you for your brilliant performance.",

    "reviewTitle": "See this movie! But not the kids.",
    "reviewBody": "I am a skeptical critic who is rarely impressed by movies anymore. This was a happy exception.I went to see this movie\nwith my brother, a film student, and by the end we were just both blown away. This is NOT a superhero movie. This is NOT\na kids movie. This is NOT a happy-happy joy-joy wisecracking action flick with a smarmy, charming good guy and a hammed\nup over-the-top bad guy. This was a study of several incredible characters scraping against each other in a desperate\nquest of heavily flawed people trying to do the right thing.Now, there were a few comic book moments. Like after the\nBatmobile gets blasted, and our hero ejects into a motorcycle type pod from the blown-up car. That one almost lost me.\nOr when the Joker tells the sad tale of his demented dad, which turns out to be just a fantasy anyway because he tells a\ndifferent origin story later. So that one kind of redeemed itself. And, Im sorry... Ms. Gyllenhall... I dont find this\nwoman attractive at all. Her face is like Droopy Dog met Kirsten Dunst. I know, its harsh, but really, it did kinda\nruin a little of the film for me. Her acting was perfectly fine. But she just isnt good looking at all. Aaron Eckhart,\nChristian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and, of course, Heath Ledger were all PERFECT. The acting\ncompliments this movie so well, youll believe that these characters could be out on the streets. The story itself is\nmore like a novel. It seems as if it struggles to find its way for the first two acts, but by the end, everything fits\ntogether. It underscores a message of dark reality versus striving ideology in a world where corruption is rampant and a\nhandful of dedicated people try to stop it. Amidst it all, is the Joker, the element of chaos ripping both systems\napart.Now lets shoot the elephant in the room. Heath Ledger is dead. His performance was so incredible, so believable,\nand so darkly disturbing, that this movie is definitely NOT for kids. People think \"Oh, its Batman, my kid will love\nit.\" Stop being an idiot. The movie is called \"THE DARK KNIGHT\" The Joker kills one person by slamming his head over a\npencil and driving it into his brain. Getting back to the elephant... Yes, I believe Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar Nom\nfor his performance. Im not saying this because hes dead. Im saying this because his performance was THAT good.The\nmovie is like watching a novel, which is my favorite kind of movie. There are stories within stories adding a rich\ncomplexity. My favorite scene is when the hardened criminal throws the detonator out the window. Youll know it when you\nsee it. I loved that.This is easily the best movie Ive seen since Iron Man, and Iron Man was f-ing good! This movie\nmade Batman Begins look shallow and empty. Not that Batman Begins was brilliant, but for a superhero movie, it was\ngood. The Dark Knight is a good MOVIE period. See it. But leave the kids at home. This isnt biff! pow! thud!\nBatman. This is dark, gritty, disturbing, gripping, enthralling and powerful. See. It.",

    "reviewBody": "Firstly.. Jesus Christ! I was not expecting that! This movie blew me away.Lets start basic natural attraction. This\nmovie had realistic action that was still breath taking. Several scenes, including one with The Joker performing a Magic\nTrick, are spiced with Brutal violence that will leave you screaming \"OHH F@#%, YOU GOT OWNED\". The Fighting had the\nsame type of realism as The Bourne Series. The Explosions, always jaw dropping. The Driving, Flat out riveting and nail\nbiting. The Intensity of some sequences will leave you speech-less. The Acting, Oh My. What an incredible cast. Every\nperformance was so believably real and just oozed with passion for the role. Every single actor and actress played their\ndesignated role flawlessly. Heath Ledger. . . In Gods Honest Truth.. Deserves an Oscar for his role. I am not saying\nthis because of him recently passing away, Im saying this because he was sick, twisted, and deep in his eyes you could\nsee.. He WAS The Joker. He was beyond amazing, not a soul on earth could have done a better job than him.Into the depths\nof this movie. This movie in general in a say on humans natural instinct. It is a insight into the human soul and the\nprimal instincts of everyone. To put a specific scene into view here Ill refer to the Boat Scene.**SPOILERS**In this\nscene it is the joker stating to Batman that he can bring out the evil in the world. Joker was pulling the evil in\npeople out into plain view. Shattering peoples appearance and their statements on their own morals. By putting their\nlives on the line. In Simpler view Joker put a gun to a mans head and said \"i will kill you unless you kill the man in\nthe chair with a bag over his face.\" Trying to prove that once humans are rattled and frightened they will let loose\nthere evil and break all rules giving into anarchy and madness, exactly what Joker was striving for. Also in this scene\nit not only tackles human nature, be two key modern stereotypes. 1: All Convicts are Terrible Murderers. and the other\nstereotype 2: View of Convicts from modern citizens. And this scene examines these stereotypes in many ways. When the\nboats uproar in shouting and screaming, in the heat of the moment, people fighting for the detonator, everyone is ready\nto blow the other ship. Until people calm down and process the situation, asking themselves if they should take the\nother peoples lives. This is where the key insight is. That any human in the heat of a moment can make a mistake, but in\nthe human mind all people who can stop and process things, are capable of good, thats is why no one pulled the pin. When\nnot blocked by adrenaline the human mind works wonders and can accept any fate at the cost of what is right and good.\nPeople like the Joker cannot do this because they cannot slow down, or make a PLAN. He states that himself whilst\ntalking to Two-Face in the hospital.Then when Joker sees neither ship explode it is hard for him to accept because he\nwas so sure the people on the boat would act in haste and be quick to blow each other away. Though Good prevailed and he\ncaught that glimpse of hope for Gotham and all of mankind, showing that Good and Right still existed in these unfair,\ndog-eat-dog, modern times.**END SPOILERS**Essentially that is why this movie is so good. Their are many other aspects to\nthis movie as well that make it good, like the music, the filming, the script and much more.This movie is a Master-Piece\nin every sense.10/10 Dark Knight, You knocked me onto my A**.",

    "reviewBody": "I have to admit that I wasnt the biggest fan of \"Batman Begins\", actually right after I watched it I came right here to\nIMDb, and just tried to explain why the movie didnt work for me, while every person on the planet came out loving it. 3\nyears later, I really dont care much about \"Batman Begins\", but I loved this movie, \"The Dark Knight\" corrected\neverything I didnt like about the first one, I loved every second of it, I even loved the Scarecrow cameo, the Falcone\nmention, and of course this movie works in every level, because it gives us a formidable opponent for Batman, and thats\nof course The Joker, he really steals the show, he really is as crazy as you think hes gonna be, the way he lies about\neverything (even his origin), the way he explains everything, the nurse outfit, everything was just perfect about him,\nLedger really deserves an Oscar, this role alone makes him worthy, and I think that the millions of people that watched\nthis movie can really discredit the Academy if that doesnt happen.I read the review I made three years ago for \"Batman\nBegins\", and really, even if you hated the first movie, theres nothing of that in here, Bruce Wayne is the ultimate\nanti-hero/hero/not-a-hero, Alfred is not a pain in this movie, Lucius Fox its not just there for the lines, Rachel is\nreally strong and really becomes a tragic hero, and Two-Face was really great, and not just a second fiddle to the\nJoker, he really is just the two extremes of a man, Gordon finds his place in Gotham, and the Mayor is Batmanuel. The\nmusic by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard works this time around, and is not just buzzing in the background like in\nthe first one (By the way the Joker theme works really great on the screen) OK, the reason I did all of this, is because\nI needed to tell everyone, that this is the Batman movie youve been waiting for, the movie that goes to those dark\nplaces you knew these movies were destined to go, but actually never went. So go ahead and watch the movie already, stop\nreading my bad writing, and put a smile on your face...",

    "reviewBody": "Just like the joker, I am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society. Not that Im\nimmune myself, but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype... to watch humans horde into a frenzy of\nblissful ignorance.Let me make myself clear. Heath Ledgers performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this\nmovie. He is stunning and he destroys JAck Nicholsons performance... and I say this knowing that I had previously\nthought, no one can do joker as good as Jack Nicholson.But Joker is only a third of this movie, and a shame in\nhindsight.The rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension, pace, plot and action.1. Christopher Nolan struggles\nwith action scenes. They are confusing, chaotic, and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and\ncerebral experience. Somewhat boring.2. Batman is a lifeless and dull character. In batman begins this was OK because\nhe was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen, like a predator, but given a more open role, Batman in a cape was\ndistracting. His metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film, but the conflicts he faces in\nthis sequel pale in comparison. Batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions. Ready to reveal his\nidentity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise... Dent must remain the white\nlight.3. Two face is an oddball. An oddball of creation, of reaction and of evolution. His arch is a forced effort by\nNolan. It doesnt make sense for him to kill Gordons family. Dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous.\nHe knew that there were bad people after him. Why the sudden transformation when this happened? The transformation of\nTwo face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening.. That to believe in chance... is to believe in\nchaos... but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him... willing to kill a child. It doesnt make\nsense. Two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining.4. The pacing of this film is poor. There are\nmoments where it is too fast, and moments where the film is too slow. Effectively, I think the movie should have ended\nsooner. It dragged out, and I was mostly non-responsive to the conclusion of two face.5. Ultimately for a movie to be\namazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed. I didnt like the movie in its entirety. And I truly believe that\nhad Heath Ledger not been involved in Dark Knight, the general consensus would have been a lot different, and the flaws\na lot more glaringly obvious. This was a 2.5 hour movie in which everything but Joker was underwhelming.It was a good\nmovie, but given the hype, its now everyones favorite film of all time... as the IMDb ratings might soon suggest.",

    "reviewBody": "I just returned home from seeing the 12:01 AM showing of The Dark Knight. If any of you insomniacs are up at this hour,\nI want you to get in your car and drive to the nearest movie theater. Yes, at 4 AM. This film was an absolute\nmasterpiece of a comic book superhero movie. A brilliant score, which, if I am not mistaken, ran throughout the duration\nof the movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that when Katie Holmes turned down her return in the Dark\nKnight, the casting directors had a chance to replace her with someone Christian Bale had more chemistry with, and they\nreplaced her with Maggie Gyllenhaal (although a great actress, completely wrong for this role). In my opinion both\nactresses delivered unconvincing performances in their respective movies. But no matter. I give this movie 9 3/4 stars,\ndue to trifles such as that. Nolan did a fantastic job conveying his intricate vision of this chapter in the life of\nthis timeless antihero. I would like to commend him for his incredible work.Heath Ledger trumps Jack Nicholson as the\nJoker, delivering what was arguably his best performance ever. He without question went out with a bang. An absolute\nartist, the perverse nature of his masterpiece of a penultimate performance will force all to shudder at such an\nuntimely death for such a talented man. A masterful performance, mind games, and plenty of big explosions await you. I\nthink ten bucks is a shame.",

    "reviewBody": "Im sorry but Im not being paid to write these reviews and it sure looks like those ahead of me are. Did we see the\nsame picture? I thought it was too long, confusing, poor plot line, very very dark, a lot of gratuitous violence and\nLedgers performance was just not Oscar material as so many are proclaiming. During the movie several people got up and\nleft. There were a couple of times there my date and I thought about leaving but we paid premium bucks to see the thing\nand you hate wasting money like that.The film gets off to a pretty good start. We were all excited but as it went along\nit began to drag. Ledger looks awful and they relied enitrely on makeup (with no prosthetics they way they did with\nNicholson) to give you the impression of a smiling joker. Here it was just white and red makeup piled on the way a\nsix-year old might do after getting into mommys makeup. And dark. Everything was so dark throughout the film that each\ntime someone opened a flip phone it was as bright as a flashlight! (I thought, surely they arent going to call anyone\nbut because so many were doing it I figured they were looking at the time - a sure sign that the film was lumbering\nalong.)From this viewers perspective I thought it was awful.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight - Stylistic Entertainment for 2 1/2 Hours",
    "reviewBody": "In my opinion, \"The Dark Knight\" is probably the greatest movie that Ive ever seen based on a comic book. Starting from\na creative direction by Christopher Nolan, this film never loses its strength due to the strong performances from a\ngroup of exceptionally gifted actors of their time. Action sequences are well-shot (especially the beginning with the\nbank robbery scene), storyline is beautifully constructed, and dialogs are memorable.Lets step aside and take a look at\nthe late Heath Ledgers performance. I was stunned by the time when the film was over; I felt that this role was\ndestined for him to play. Prior to the viewing of this performance, I had this notion of seeing Ledger as a mediocre\nactor with no training trying to seek stardom for himself. However, this performance as the Joker changed my whole\nperspective of him; it filled me with tremendous respect for him as a dedicated and talented actor of his generation. He\nlives and breathes like the Joker; his performance makes Jack Nicholsons performance seem so lame. He is totally\nunpredictable. His anarchic style of interpretation keeps the audience in suspense - whenever he is on screen, no one\nknows what hes going to do next. Ledger possesses this Brando-esquire unpredictability within him that makes his\nperformance so interesting to watch. My favorite scene was the interrogation scene between the Joker and Batman. As\nBatman pounds on the Joker more and more, Jokers smile grows bigger; Ledger displays the danger and the violence that\nlies underneath the sinister character. Just watching Ledgers performance makes everything worthwhile. It will be\ninspiring to many of the aspiring actors out there (like me) and I wish he wins a posthumous Oscar for this role.Other\nperformances were outstanding - Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhall, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts, Michael Caine, etc.\nAaron Eckhart gives a tour-de-force performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, capturing the dynamic layers of emotions that\nthe character is going through. However, Gary Oldmans performance in this film was one of the reason why I loved this\nfilm so much. Continuing from his touching performance in Batman Begins, Oldman uses his chance to convey the emotions\nand the development of the character through his subtle performance. Especially the scene with Harvey Dent near the end\nof the film, Oldman just lets everything out and just touches the hearts of every moviegoers out there. If Oldman\nreceives an Oscar nomination for this, I wouldnt be surprised; because he truly deserves it. Period.Action scenes are\nvery gripping to watch. Nolan takes you on this exciting and dangerous journey of following the intense cat-and-mouse\ngame between Batman and the Joker. Bank robbery scene and the Dent abduction scene are fascinating to watch and it never\nlets your energy level down. Combining all the elements of the film (explained above), this film doesnt even feel like\n2 1/2 hour film; just flow with the movie and you wont even know the time is passing by like a wind.I give this movie 9\nout of 10 stars because I wasnt fully satisfied or extremely impressed with the film. Maybe it was because I went in\nwith such a HIGH expectation due to the hype of the film. But, no matter what it is, this film will stand to be one of\nthe finest movies to be made and I hope it will garner some Oscar nominations. Better yet, few Oscars.R.I.P. Heath\nLedger (1979~2008)",

    "reviewTitle": "Joker Made the Movie",
    "reviewBody": "To start, The Dark Knight definitely lived up to its hype. Intense would be a word to describe the action in the movie,\nas well as suspenseful. With every weapon pulled out in the movie, someone dies, unlike most movies where the gun is\njust put down and the one it is pointed at stays alive. the action and dialogue scenes were equalized to keep the\naudience entertained as well as informed.Now, to start with the characters. Not much humor was passed in the movie, not\nincluding the Joker. He was the saviour of the movie. If there was no Joker, the movie may have gotten just over 6 stars\non my rating. He kept the audience entertained with black humor comedy and most of the action/ killing scenes. Ledger\ndid a better job than Nicholson in my opinion. As for Batman, Christian Bale did a great job of not attracting the\nmovies attention to himself. For most of the movie, everyone really just wanted to see the Joker. Two Face, the other\nvillain, was just as exciting as Batman.This movie could have been better if each of the main characters was developed\nmore and not just the Joker. That is why I gave the movie 9 out of 10 stars. The filming was great, the dialouge was\ngreat, and the action was great, but the characters werent developed too well. Definitely see this movie as it will\nblow you away on the big screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "Like nothing youve seen from him before",
    "reviewBody": "I dont want to sound insensitive, but when people talk about how Heath Ledgers suicide may have been due to immersing\nhimself too deeply into the role of the Joker, I think it may have been true.The Joker as portrayed in The Dark Knight\nis easily the most ruthless character Ive ever seen. In one scene, Batman drives his Batpod straight for the Joker,\nwhile Joker simply stands in the middle of the street screaming for Batman to run him down. You can tell, as the movie\nunfolds, that its not a deathwish that drives him; its a chilling indifference to his own fate, as long as he can\ndestroy the Batmans soul in the process.To say that hes prepared to die to accomplish his goal would imply that he\nfelt death was something for which he needed to prepare; the Joker simply doesnt care whether hes alive or dead. He\nknows that if the Batman kills him that it would haunt Batman for the rest of his life, which would be worse than\ndeath.He repeats this in a scene with Harvey Dent, in which he hands him a gun to see if the heroic Harvey will murder\nhim rather than try to bring him to justice. Recently scarred in an explosion, the newly emerged Two-Face tosses his\nsignature coin to decide the Jokers fate; the Jokers only reaction to this is \"Now were talking.\"Some people are\noffended by this; not that hes violent, but that hes wholly psychotic. They think of the over-the-top Cesar Romero\nJoker, or even the gangster-clown Jack Nicholson Joker, and say \"thats how it should be\". These people either havent\nread the graphic novels detailing the Jokers reign of terror over Gotham City, or they have and just prefer that they\nhave a \"funny villain\".Thats not what the Joker is. The Joker is not a risk-taker or a thrill-seeker; he is nothing\nmore or less than a complete psychopath. Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime is absolutely my favorite\ninterpretation. Every scene which features him leaves you wondering, \"Would I have closed my eyes if I knew that was\ncoming?\", so vicious and yet so compelling they all are. Of course, they often happen too quickly for you to make that\ndecision. If I want comedy, then Ill watch the animated series and catch Mark Hamills act.In short, its like nothing\nfrom either the Joker or Heath Ledger that youve ever seen before.",

The direction is flawless and amazing. I really cant put it into\nwords how great it is, you have to go see it for yourself, the cinematography was probably the best Ive seen. I know\nIm sounding like a fanboy right now but its the truth.Heath Ledger is beyond words. He is the best villain I have ever\nwitnessed on screen, yes better than Darth Vader. His self regard for human life makes him the perfect nemesis for\nBatman. Ive lost count at how many people he killed in this film. He got into Batman/Bruces mind and messed with him\nemotionally. He was psychotic and was funny even when he wasnt supposed to. Its a shame that he wont be able to watch\nhis performance on the screen, R.I.P. Right now if he isnt voted for Best Supporting Actor it would be a real shame.\nYoull will understand once you see this movie. He made him so realistic and scary. I wouldnt bring a kid under 6 to\nthis movie.Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman were all terrific as well but were just out shined by Heath\nLedger. Christian does a much better job this time around as Bruce Wayne and Batman. I had my doubts of Aaron at first\nbut he delivered and Oldman is the perfect Jim Gordon.The action sequences took a huge leap from the first film and\nthere are tons of them. The music from BB returns and is still as solid as ever. Nolan has really created a masterpiece\nhere and with his little use of CGI makes it even more impressive.Im still in awe while typing this and its still not\nas long as I wanted it to be. Im going to try to go back tomorrow or Saturday and watch it again. If you dont even\nlike Batman or comics you will like this movie and it better be the first \"Superhero\" movie to be nominated for Best\nPicture, along with Best Cinematography, Best Supporting Actor and Best Director. This movie will be in talks when you\nmention best movies like Godfather, Godfather 2, ESB, The Shawshank Redemption, Schlinders List etc etc. I recommend it\nto anyone.Rating: 9.8/10",

The storytellers fully recognize those\nfacts. The intellectual twists, games and suspense remind me of the Jason Bourne films. Yeah, that good.You will sense\nthe point when you think a normal film would have ended, but there is still more to come...another dark story to\nfinish.You will not leave the theater feeling inspired, because there is no happy ending.

    "reviewTitle": "Believe the hype!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "I dont even know where to begin with this movie. I have never been more excited to see a movie more than Iwas excited\nto see The Dark Knight. As soon as I saw Memento, I knew that Christopher Nolan was what all directors in Hollywood\nshould aspire to. Batman Begins was incredible and who could forget the intricacies of The Prestige. Christopher Nolan,\nPeter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro and Ridley Scott are the class of Hollywood right now. Now for The Dark KnightI was\nabsolutely ecstatic when I heard Heath Ledger was going to portray The Joker. Heaths death was tragic in every way\npossible. We lost a true talent who would have captured the big screen for many many years to come. Early marketing was\nall hype for Ledgers Joker performance and rightly so. In all of the comic book world there is no more important\nhero/villain relationship than Batman/Joker. Its better than Superman/Lex Luthor, better than X-Men/Magneto, better\nthan Fantastic 4/Dr. Doom, better than Spider-Man/Venom. You DO NOT have Batman without the Joker. With all the hype\nleading up to Ledgers Joker the question is raised: is it worth the hype? The answer, in a word is ABSOLUTELY. Jack\nNicholson has nothing on Heath Ledger. The Joker steals the screen in every scene he is in. He also has the greatest\nentrance of any character possibly ever with his \"disappearing pencil trick.\" It sets the tone for his character as\ndark, twisted, demented, sadistic and strangely funny. It is a OMG scene but you will have a very hard time not\nlaughing. Ledger steals the movie, but in a very good way. He is over-the-top but you never ask him to apologize for it,\nin fact, youll be thanking him for it. The Joker sums it up in one line when he says to Batman \"you and I could do this\nforever.\" If the Acadamy does not recognize Heath Ledger posthumously for his role in The Dark Knight, then I vow to\nnever watch the Oscars ever again.Now for Christian Bale. After watching the 89 and 90s Batmans I always thought that\nif you could take Michael Keatons Bruce Wayne character and mix it with Val Kilmers Batman character that youd have\nthe perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Christian Bale. He is the fun loving and smart Bruce\nWayne that Micheal Keaton gave us and the brooding and unrelenting Batman that Val Kilmer gave us. Batman has always\nbeen my favorite hero because he has no superhuman powers. He is a vigilante but never crosses the dark line. However,\nat the same time he is angry with how his beloved Gotham City has been taken over by crime. I have always liked\nChristian Bale. In The Dark Knight we see Batman struggling with how the morals and ethics of being a hero, but not\ncrossing the moral line and becoming a criminal himself. Much like in Batman Forever we see Bruce Wayne considering\nhanging up the mask forever. Batman goes from being the Caped Crusader to the title character of The Dark Knight. Bale\npulls this role off flawlessly and you really start to feel for his struggle with donning the mask and cape.Michael\nCaine is always brilliant, and he gives the role of Alfred Pennyworth his due course and adds in some humility,\ndirection and even a little humor. I am glad Nolan gave him this role.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is awesome. This was\nanother casting that I was very excited for. Dents character is perfect. If Batman is the Dark Knight, then Dent is\nGothams White Knight so to speak. Dent ruthlessly hunts down, in the legal realm, Gothams criminals in an effort to\nclean the streets of crime and corruption. However, as we all know, Harvey Dent must eventually become Two-Face and you\nsee his struggle with morality. Dent himself has a dark side that he must confront on several occasions. SPOILER\nHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dent does become Two-Face about 3/4ths of the way through the movie. It is not the cartoon-like\nTwo-Face that Tommy Lee Jones gives us. Like the rest of the movie, it is dark and evil and when you see his face you\nmight look away at first. Its not for the feint of heart. END SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfectly\nre-cast as Rachel Dawes. She seems to connect better with Bale than Holmes did. However, Nolan does not give her\ncharacter much to do in the movie. She does have a cool encounter with The Joker, but overall her character is not\nextremely important to the movie as a whole.Gary Oldman is another character that deserves an award for his role in The\nDark Knight. His portrayal of Jim Gordon is awesome. For moments in the movie you actually forget that hes acting. He\nmust find his own place in a corrupt police force that struggles with deciding to capture or honor Batman. Nolan hit the\nnail on the head again with this casting choice.Overall, the story is a little convoluted, but it doesnt matter because\nonce the Joker hits the scene, thats all you care about. The fights between Batman and Joker are epic. This is the\nblueprint of how all comic book/superhero movies must be made. Iron Man was cool, but I left this movie thinking to\nmyself, \"whos Iron Man?\" This movie lives up to every hype possible and is required viewing for everyone and anyone who\nlikes movies at all. This is one of the few movies Ive seen that I cannot point out any flaws in the film-making.A\nresounding 10/10Heath Ledger 1979-2008 RIP",

First of all everything that people said about heath ledger\ndeserving an Oscar for his portrayal of the joker is completely solid. He really is amazing he has this charisma about\nhim and hell make you laugh when hes blowing up a hospital literally. His character is so deep and evil youll forget\nyour watching a batman movie. Secondly, everything else, i dont mean to sound lazy but honestly if i said all thats\ngood about this film id be typing for hours. Each performance is great if not excellent, the writing is perfect and\ntouches on issues youd never expect in a superhero film, great action sequences and even has some small bits of comedy\nto lighten up this otherwise dark film and i mean that in a good way. If there is one thing i could nitpick it would be\nthat the scarecrow was wasted and unnecessary in this installment.

    "reviewTitle": "Mindblowing. In an almost frustrating kind of way.",
    "reviewBody": "\"He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss,\nthe abyss will also gaze into thee.\" Friedrich Nietzche.Perhaps it was the midnight openings fault. I was very tired. I\nknew something spectacular, awe-inspiring, and vast was passing in front of my eyes, but it was all so very fast. It was\nlike passing a beautiful landscape in a minute. A two-and-a-half-hour-long minute. I felt aggravated that Christopher\nNolan had not given his public more time for the (no doubt) wonderful movie to sink in. I felt genuinely angry.Dare I\nsay disappointed? But this morning, getting up for work, the wretched movie would not get off my mind. Everything came\nback in pieces, Gordons teary-eyed pleas, Lucius righteous resignation, Alfreds military past, Rachels goodbye,\nDents near-unshatterable idealism and the Jokers manic genius, twitchy words, his unbelievable coherence and the fact\nI found I could quote almost everything he had said, notwithstanding the fact that it was impossible to understand the\nfirst time through. And Batman was everything. He was the glue attempting to hold a crumbling world together.And\nsuddenly another annoyingly memorable Nolan film came to mind: Memento. I thought the movie to be completely unbearable\nat first. Now, after over 20 views, I daresay it is my absolute favourite.The Dark Knight is of the same substance: a\ntorturing, hard-to-digest plot, which serves to distracts you from Nolans point. The plot is amazing, but focus on it\ntoo hard, and you will miss the golden thread beneath the surface, the soul of his story: the strife within his\ncharacters, the strife within society, within existence. The anguish of believing in the ultimate goodness of man in a\ncity as rotten as Gotham, goodness taught through an example killed in an alley so long ago, anchors the very motivation\nof Batman, the source of all his strength and his greatest weakness. The faith in a condemned humankind as opposed to\nhimself alone, is the Batmans ultimate paradox. A paradox that is clenched, twisted, and crushed by the prodigious\nJoker, gradually destroying all that Bruce Wayne cares for in the world, leaving him with nothing but his pain, his\nsolitude, and his excruciating hope.The Joker, devastatingly, makes more sense and coherence than all of Gothams\ndesperate society and leaders put together. With every brush of genius he paints the gruesome portrait that shows the\nworld: \"Your system is broken. Your rules are farce. Nothing can come from your mediocre selfishness, your inescapably\nflawed human nature.\" It seems strange, but someone said that before. It was Bruce, the day he set out to achieve the\nvengeance that would have quelled the storm inside him. The day the Batman might have never been.",

    "reviewTitle": "Deep, Dark, Compelling, The Dark Knight transcends a genre.",
    "reviewBody": "so yes i had a ticket to last nights midnight showing of christopher nolans second installment in his batman\nfranchise, with Christian bale playing the caped crusader for this second go round. I dont have to tell you how much i\nhad been anticipating this movie and from when the lights dimmed and then when they came back on, my head was\nspinning.The storyline isnt quite so linear, while still keeping a chain of events it kind of hops around a bit, it can\nbe distracting a bit to a viewer who isnt familiar with nolans camera work and storytelling, but this ones quite\ngood, while we have characters who teeter on that line of black and white, we have others who completely cross over and\nend up smudging the lines until there is only grey. The story is captivating, intriguing, and keeps you guessing, it was\ncertainly worth the 3 year wait.The acting well i think it can and will be said that Heath Ledgers performance is\nnothing short of legendary, really and its not his transformation though impressive, its how he completely engulfs\nthe character, he isnt some actor playing a part he is the joker, he eat, sleeps, and breathes madness and anarchy, a\ntruly truly brilliant and very scary performance. Driven by the mantra of just wanting to \"watch the world burn\" his\nacts dont have reason, they are just to cause panic. Heath Ledger weather he died or not needs to be nominated for a\nbest actor or best supporting actor award at next years Oscars, its that important, its that good. What a way to go\nout, and what a performance, on the other side theres newcomer aaron eckhart who gave a pretty notable and strong\nperformance as D.A. Harvey Dent, really, and then does a nice job of his transformation into two face, a very notworthy\nperformance. Christian Bale gave his always well acted performance but was obviously overshadowed by ledger and eckhart\nwhich i guess was to be expected, batman nor bruce wayne are very loud, obvious, or emotionally vibrant characters, so\nits easy to see why his performance wasnt the strongest. All of the supporting players, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman,\nMaggie Gyllenhall, and Eric Roberts all gave expected performances, nothing out of the ordinary and as always Gary\nOldman shines once again in a very well done character acting role as Comissioner Jim Gordon.The direction of the film\nwas so paramount to its feel and how good it really was, Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of our time\nand really shows it in this one, weather its the opening bank robbery scene or showing batman gliding over hong kong,\nhe really knows no ends to camera angles and getting the most out of his actors.Overall the movie is honestly without\nbeing biased one of the best movies ive ever seen, it engrosses the viewer into a world not all that different from\nours, a world with a single sliver of hope, and batman is that hope. Its so important the message of staying the course\nno matter the cost, the integrity of batman/bruce wayne through people dying, nearly wavers, and nearly crosses that\nline. The Joker/Batman showdown is honestly a really great battle of the psycology of both characters, this is most\nlikely the most complex theme and element of this movie and both characters pull it off so well. I cant express my own\npersonal satisfaction of how this movie turned out, its not only a great superhero film, its just a great film. It\ntranscends genres and is just a very well done film, great acting, directing, storyline that is engrossing, some funny\ndialouge with the joker, and yes hes funny in a sick silly way, As a whole this movie is as good as it could possibly\nhope to be. A well done film and a film that deserves all the accolades it has received and is yet to receive.10/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight. I couldnt avoid some spoilers, but minor ones.",
    "reviewBody": "I went to the screening of The Dark Knight yesterday. Expectations: really, REALLY high. When i came out of the cinema i\nwasnt as stunned as i thought i was going to be. The movie is great, no doubt of it but it was so overrated i cant even\nexplain it. Lets divide it into 3. Start, main action and end. The start is slooow, but its fun. First Joker appearances\nare at least, funny. Ill try not to spoil anything but his jokes are Bizarre, you cant help laughing sometimes. It seems\nthat it is going to be a nice movie but... nothing happens. In some moment i couldnt detect movie turns from a\nslow-paced one to an incredible action movie. Now this was what i was expecting for... but the end is not as strong... i\nneeded something more. OK i wont spoil it.Heath Ledger as the Joker was extremely good, but its not greatest villain\never as i read everywhere!!! hes not scary at all... he is just mad, hes not even evil. Just one really madman.Christian\nBale as Batman is not that good. When he is bruce wayne its all fine but when he switches to his batman voice is\nextremely annoying. Get the potato out of his mouth PLEASE!!!!Harvey dent character is nice... Aaron does a good job but\nTwo Face is awful. What the **** is Terminator doing here?? and hes not even bad! he just wants revenge, doesnt seem\nbad to me. The rest of the cast is fine... Saying that this is greatest performance of Gary Oldman, Michael Caine or\nMorgan Freeman is just to insult their brilliant career. They have only a few lines in the movie.The OST is nice, but\nsometimes it is extremely epic for what we are watching on the screen. For example, harvey dent in his office with one\nGladiator epic theme is too much.Scarecrow seems so weak that i think the fat batman could arrest him. I think this\nmovie tries to be so real, and thats the main problem. Everything is real until terminator appearance. Its too weird.\nAnd wasted the rest of the movie.Final Words: Nice movie... not flawless, good joker bad two face. Good cast, bad\nbatman. Its definitely not the greatest movie ever but its worth to see it. Sorry for my bad English :P.",

    "reviewBody": "I was so thoroughly impressed by this movie in every way humanly possible. I never liked the Batman movies growing up,\nespecially after the first movie with Michael Keaton. Batman Begins grabbed my attention much because of my love for\nChristian Bales acting. Together, Bale and Nolan have resurrected a dead franchise.I am surprised this movie earned a\nPG-13 rating. This movie was so dark and tragic, I wouldve guessed R-rating. I have no quarrels with the movies\ndarkness and am even more impressed this movie WASNT designed with children in mind.This movie will take you for a ride\non an emotional roller coaster. After Rachels death, I nearly cried for Harvey and his sadness. It was overwhelming. As\nfor the next movie, I wouldve liked to see Nolan save two-face for the finale. He entered two-face in this movie to\ngive the sorrow and sadness factor. I cant think of any villain who could be better than two-face and especially Joker\nwere in this movie. Heath...you deserve an Oscar hands down.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Flick with minor faults....",
    "reviewBody": "Working at Blockbuster Video it takes a lot for me to go to the theatre to see films. I went to an early midnight\nshowing and was not disappointed in the least. This movie has an all-star cast and Bale once again performs both Bruce\nWayne and Batman to the fullest. Hedger is scary good and of course Freeman is always great as the technological\nmastermind behind all of Batmans gadgets. The plot is great and the fighting is awesome. For me however, there were a\nfew minor faults...1) Scarecrow was suddenly a fighter of good? And his henchman came complete with \"batman\" attire? So\nyoure trying to convince me that a villain like the scarecrow, who lived to bring people into a state of insanity is\ngood? and without any explanation??? 2) Batman was more punch and less thought. Now I understand it was written this\nway, but lets be serious. Batman has to choose between Rachel or Harvey Dent...naturally Bruce chooses Rachel. But\nBatman would have and should have known this was a trick, it is the Joker for crying out loud. I mean he knew that the\n\"Jokers\" in the warehouse were the hostages tied up, taped up, and masked, but he couldnt see that Joker told Batman\nwhere the opposite was?? I dont buy it, sorry.3) And this is perhaps just old school preference here but...The cape\nlooked way to un-batman. First off the masked just looked way too tight. Secondly, I like the idea of the cape, but I\nwant it ALL the time. Its cool that is expands or whatever during fall, but I want a blowing-in-the-wind \"BAT\"\ncape.Overall, was the movie worth a midnight showing, and is it worth going to in two days with my buddy from work, yes\nand yes. But was it as good as Batman Begins...I dont think so.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Decent movie. Dont believe the hype",
    "reviewBody": "First of all I want to this movie has its good points. The Opening scene starts off very strong. But then this ends up\nbeing one of the most impact-full scenes featuring the joker. Throughout this movie I was waiting for that scene. A\ngreat dialogue scene between The Joker and Gordon. Or even one between Batman and Two-Face. But Most of the bad-guys\ndidnt have enough dialogue to make them more than a 2-d thug.I was also waiting for the film to build into a climax.\nKind of like the first but it never happened. Both of the face off-s that batman had with both bad guys went no where. I\nkept drawing back to the Tim Burton movie, or as far as two face the cartoon, and remembering the great jobs they did\nwith them. At the end of the original batman of course Jack Nicholson isnt going to put up a fight with batman. But his\nhenchmen gave him problems, and when they didnt he would threaten batmans girl with acid. The end of this movie\nfizzles. They took a great premise with the ferrys, and at the expense of trying to make the movie realistic they made\nit very un-suspenseful.Two other things that bugged me throughout were that editing and shooting around the action\nscenes. I never would get a sense of the whole scene or what was going on. The editing was really fast and from close\nshot to close shot. No long shots what so ever so we couldnt get a true sense of where the character where in relation\nto one another - AKA the underground car chase scene. Also Christian Bales voice in the bat suit bugged me. But these\nare minor things compared to anti-climactic ending of the movie.In conclusion this movie started big but didnt live up\nto the hype. And when I say the word HYPE Im not referring to Heath Ledger. Im referring to HYPE about the JOKER! One\nof the best bad guys ever created. It just seemed like they were caught between being scary and funny with the Joker\nwhich is a good place to be. But in that struggle I never felt scared for a second. Where as in past Batman stories I\nwas truly scared that his schemes would work.",

    "reviewTitle": "A movie that surpasses anything Ive ever seen!! And I wont forget his performance, ever!!!",
    "reviewBody": "It was a flawless movie! Definitely intense suspenseful, and very depressing, from the whole death of Maggie, us\nthinking that Gordon ( Gary Oldman) died and then a shock of his coming back to life the hole audience clapped and\ncheered!!! But the one thing that really made the movie depressing to me, of course, Heath. Ever since I was young he\nhad become such a favorite actor of mine, his gentleness, how shy he was!! delicate, i dont understand why god took\naway a person like that. And its so hard for me as much as I just dying to talk of how his performance in the joker was\nthe best performance of a male actor Ive seen in many years, that makeup he did himself, that voice, laugh, and oh my\ngod!!!! The pencil trick!!!!!!!! What is now from what we have seen, this is undeniably the turning point in his career!\nOscar worthy, Hell yes!!!! And from all of this, hes gone. Its a shame. I would like to think of it as his body is gone\n, but his performances will live on forever and from what what Ive seen from his masterful performance in the dark\nnight, AFI has a new actor to add to their lists!!! Well besides that misfortune I think we had a wonderful cast with\nperformances that moved me and heath, leaving me breathless! Its rare a movie have flawlessness especially a sequel. But\nthis was so much more, than anything Ive seen, Im honored to have gone to the premiere, honored to have seen this\nflawless movie, and honored to see Heaths flawless performance for the last time! rest in piece Heath Ledger, You wont\nbe forgotten from me! 4/4/79 - 1/22/08",

    "reviewTitle": "best superhero movie of all time!?!?",
    "reviewBody": "No other superhero movie have i seen is better than this...i came out of theaters scoffing at the Hancock posters. The\nDark Knight surpassed all hopes i had for this movie. At first i was questioning if it would be better than Batman\nBegins. It outdid it in every aspect. Christian Bale is the best batman anyone could ever ask for. Maggie Gyllenhaal was\na better choice for the role of Rachel Dawes. I personally am not a big Katie Holms fan. Though she did very well in\nBatman Begins i feel Gyllenhaal was a better selection for the role. Aaron Eckhart was everything you could ask for in\nHarvey Dent(surpassed Billy Dee Williams role as dent in the 89 film) And the transformation between Dent to Two-Face\nbegan very subtle and maxed out as best it could. I feel it was done very well with the gasoline spilling on his left\nhalf of his face and it just catching a spark. He played Two-Face very well way better than Tommy Lee Jones in the old\nBatman movies that many people will now forget. Eckhart did very well in this role.Heath Ledger...he stole the show! It\nwas going to be tough to replace Jack Nicholson as the Joker in our hearts. Ledger was the best selection for this\ncharacter. He was so devoted to almost create his own back story for the character. He went back and forth from extreme\nto extreme to complete this role. Anyone who can watch A Clockwork Orange(1971) daily just to watch Alex to get into\ncharacter has got to be nuts. And to look to Sid Vicious(who killed his wife or girlfriend) for inspiration. This helped\nhim pull off \"nuts\" better than anyone else could even try to do. His depiction and so chosen persona of the Joker was\nright on. Ledger did great work on his last full production movie before his tragic death. All in all the best movie of\n2008 and best superhero movie ever!",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Sequel Ive Ever Seen",
    "reviewBody": "Just so you know, I do tend to like most sequels except ones like The Butterfly Effect 2 and Phenomenon 2 which was just\na retelling of the first movie usually with no characters from the first one in it. Also a sequel like Blues Brothers\n2000 was crap. Magic? Honostly. Wow, Im nearly a full paragraph into my review and I havent said anything about the\nDark Knight except that its a sequel. Well there is one thing you should know about this movie. It Freaking Rocks Im a\nhuge fan of comics but I mostly stay in the Marvel category because DC always seemed to outdated. Superman and Batman\n(the original movies) came out some 20-30 years ago and never seemed quite realistic. Studios have tried to bring these\nfamous superheroes into the 21st century with Superman return, which was supposed to be the third in the Christopher\nReeves series even thought their was little or no continuity and I had thought that Batman Begins was supposed to have\nbeen a prequel to the old Timothy Burton series (though now Ive read the IMDb FAQ I now know that it wasnt which was\ngood because I couldve told you that if it was then it failed considering the original movie had it that the Joker\nkilled Bruces parents... I think... my memorys getting away from me... It mightve been Two-Face...) And speaking of\nthe Joker and Two-Face, that brings me to the two main villains of this film. Heath Ledger and Whatshisname (Aaron\nEckhart? Id check but that would take precious seconds away from me ranting about my new favourite movie) were\nABSOLUTELY FATASTIC. Ill explain by starting with the Joker. First of all, I was a huge fan of Jack Nicklsons (I spelt\nthat wrong) performance of the Joker in Tim Burtons classic. He was absolutely perfect choice for the Joker. But Im\ngoing to have to say that Heath Ledgers performance completely surpasses Nicklsons. Wow. The voice that Ledger has\ncreated for his villain made my skin crawl. The way that he could make every lip smack so perfectly audible was creepy.\nAlso, the voice was obviously the voice of a lunatic and when he was angry and shouted it made me jump ie. the video\nwhen he shouted \"LOOK AT ME!\" and also when he said \"Why... so... Serious?\". But we must remember that Ledger didnt\nactually come up with the dialog himself and a round of applause should go to Christopher Nolan and his brother for\nwriting the part so well. Dont get me wrong, the first time that he explained how he got his scars my heart sank as I\nfelt they had destroyed the mystery that had made the Joker so creepy. But when he explained how he got his scars the\nsecond and the story was completely different I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie hoping to hear a\nbrand new story about his scars (sadly though it never came). Now comes the second villain. Im glad the the Nolan\nbrothers knew that people would already know that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face and gave us little nods with things\nlike the coin flipping and the line \"You live long enough to see yourself become the villain\". The only thing that upset\nme is that he had to die, because he had obviously become a madman. I cant say that the performance was as legendary as\nthe Ledgers back was fantastic nonetheless. The funny thing is that the performances of the two bad guys completely\novershadow the main character Bruce Wayne/Batman. That isnt to say that Chritain Bales performance was bad its just\nthat we sometimes forget that the movie is about Batman and not Commissioner Gordon, who seems to be the main good guy\nconsidering that at the end of the movie... wait, you know what. Even though Ive said that there are spoilers in this\nreview, Im not going to give away the ending that makes this movie so much better than all other superhero movies.\nWatch it again if youve already seen it. Best Movie Ever. 10/10",

The real surprise for me was how excellent Two Face was in the movie; I hadnt seen his disfigured\nface prior to the movie, and he looked AWESOME! Straight out of the comic books, and his transformation from Harvey\nDents white knight to murderous monster was chilling. And believable; you can see his evolution throughout the film.\nThe incident that pushed him over the edge would have challenged any of us to stay on the straight and narrow. Much\nbetter than Anakin Skywalkers turning to the Dark Side in Revenge of the Sith. I recommend seeing this movie whether\nyoure a Bat Fan or not.",

    "reviewBody": "wow. just...wow. this movie is so amazing. words cannot describe it. well...i guess i can try my best. so where do we\nbegin. Im going to start off with the man who is the star of the picture: Christian bale. this man gave so much depth\nto both Bruce Wayne and batman. you can see the emotions in his eyes and you can also just feel this characters pain.\nits just madness. bale is and always will be the best batman. now Maggie Gyllenhaal. she gave so much more to Rachel\nthan stone faced Katie Holmes. Maggie made Rachel a tough woman who is not a damsel in distress. Rachel in this movie is\nsomeone who can take care of herself and is not afraid. when you see her showing emotion you see emotion. you see a real\ncharacter. its because of Maggie that i actually like the character of Rachel Dawes now. Gary Oldman. a versatile actor\nlike him needs no words except that he embodied a wholesome character (alright this is in the words of Chris Nolan but\nthe guy is sooooo right). now Aaron Eckhart. Harvey dent/two-face is my second favorite villain of all time and this man\ngot him down. Harvey dent is an American hero and a person who has anger issues *wink**wink* and someone like Aaron was\nperfect you see someone with this battle of when to cross a line. this Harvey/two-face is the one that not only me but\neveryone has been waiting for. and last but not least...heath ledger. what can i say. this man got him down. joker is\nlike a pack of playing cards you dont know what he is going to do next. even his voice is like a pack of playing cards\nbeing thrown at you theres so much to it. i mean i found myself laughing a few times. who knew black humor can be so\nfunny? heath embodied this character. everything was vintage joker. you cant see heath one bit. its like someone caught\na real life joker on camera. Chris Nolan is god. what Bruce Wayne said in batman begins is right. batman is\nincorruptible, he cant be destroyed. he is the dark knight. the character of batman and this movie of him will live on\nforever. batman is a savior. batman is a guardian. batman is a legend. and he will live on forever.",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark Knight Review",
    "reviewBody": "I have one problem with this movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She has no conviction, she is annoying, and I\nfelt no sorrow when she died. Her failure to portray Rachel the way Katie Holmes made her in Batman Begins as wholesome\nand dedicated makes it hard to relate to Harvey Dents grief. In this movie she is entirely different, seemingly only\nthere because the plot requires it, she brings nothing to the movie. With that being said, that is one very little flaw\nin a fantastic movie. The sonar cell phone was a little strange, but Ill take it. I mean, Batman always has cool\ntoys.What really makes this movie great is the way it can make you feel twisted. Ledger as the Joker is marvelous. He\nsays that he has no plans, money is meaningless, its all about the message. Hes trying to send the message that we are\nall a little corrupt, were all a little off, and we just need to be pushed. The human mind is a fragile thing. As dark\nas this movie is you are frequently laughing. The Joker takes a mans life with a joke, the disappearing pencil, sick\nand disgusting, yet everyone is laughing. Every scene with Ledger leaves you laughing and feeling as if you are the most\nterribly gruesome person. Why are you laughing, hes murdering people. We are corrupt. That is what he believes, and\nthats what he shows you. Its sick.Aside from the violence and mind twist you have the struggling hero. Or heroes.\nBatman fighting crime along side Harvey Dent. In the end Dent is corrupted, Batman is not. Batman is the hero that\nGotham needs him to be. The greatness of this movie has little to do with Batman, but what he stands for against a world\nof corruption. He stands as the man who is willing to be loved or hated to see his city fight back. I will say no more,\nyou must see this movie.It is likely that I will never love another movie more.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nolan creates brilliant multi-colored film and yet it all seems so familiar...",
    "reviewBody": "Well, I must say that the imagery in this movie is fantastic. I love the directing. Very symbolic. The acting is truly\nbrilliant. Heath Ledger is most definitely a fine actor and very impressive. However, this movie was not so outstanding\nand I was not awe-stricken. The plots were very repetitive. It was as if I had seen it all before. Granted, the joker\nwas extremely malevolent but that scene where he tells Batman that the city will turn on him and they will not love him\nanymore--all I could see was that scene from Spider-Man. Goblin speaks almost the exact same words. The only difference\nis that Spider-Man was made six years earlier. Also, the mind games that Two-Face plays with his victims reminded me of\nthe horrifying games of Russian roulette during The Deer Hunter. Or quite possibly the game of life and death that Anton\nChigurh plays with his victims in No Country for Old Men. Life is depended upon a single flip of the coin. Besides this\nmovie not being very original, it was overall pretty good. The Spider-Man 3-like structure of bringing in a second\nvillain halfway through and carrying on several subplots worked out for Dark Knight, I guess. I would recommend it if\nyou have not seen any of the following movies. Otherwise, it is like watching a brilliantly directed sum-up of so many\nother better movies before The Dark Knights time.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Elephant In The Room",
    "reviewBody": "My review contains some spoilers.Maybe everyone is afraid to say it, but theres an elephant in the room and its that\nthis movie was NOT as good as expected and certainly not as good as the hype implied. Im compelled to call a spade a\nspade.Most movies (whether good or bad) know enough to have a beginning middle and end. This movie was ALL MIDDLE. It\nwas a series of scenes strung together with no pacing to allude to how the overall time was passing, with no feeling of\nbuildup and no distinction between what should be acts that define where you might be in the story line. I guarantee Im\nnot the only one out there who kept looking at my watch starting around the 1-hour mark and hoping the pace would be\nimproved.I want to say good things. Heath Ledgers performance was good. The anti-moral undertones were ballsy for a\nmass-market movie. The 2-face special effects were handled perfectly. And I was a comic fan as a kid and any comic book\nmovie, especially a batman one, deserves credit by default.Now the bad. One of the things that made the first movie\ngreat was the attempt to ground it totally in reality. Barely any suspension of disbelief was needed for \"Batman\nBegins\". But in this - sonar cell phones? Uh, what? In short time turning every cell phone in Gotham into a sonar\nreal-time 3D tracking system for the entire city with real-time 3D visuals all being fed into some location,\nsomewhere...? What? And then the glowing goggles that somehow received the signal... What? Was this an attempt to use a\nfarcical James Bond jump-the-shark plot device to make the writing a lot easier near the end? Wheres the back-story for\nThe Joker? Hes just some loony? Whats his motivation? OK he burns a pile of money. How does he get anything done\nwithout money? Do all his hired guns work for free? The ones that it takes to move hundreds of barrels of explosive fuel\ninto all kinds of locations throughout the movie. 2 warehouses, 2 boats, a hospital...The costume modification mid-way\nwas weak and made batman LOOK weak. The actress change, then killing her anyway. Why not just create a different\ncharacter for the love interest? The joker was EVERYWHERE at all times, like an omniscient god. Give me a break. Nothing\nwas played out as plausible. Maggie Gyllenhaal is NOT ATTRACTIVE (at least not for the character shes supposed to be\nplaying). Bales voice while as Batman was too forced and was over-the-top. The story drags and drags. No mansion? A\npenthouse in a city that looks nothing like Gotham is supposed to look. It was a shiny upscale city that looked more\nlike upscale Manhattan. I could go on, but basically there were another 50 times like that in the movie where, rather\nthan helping me immerse into the story, it made me go \"huh?\"",

I have seen all of the old movies, and I was expecting good things from this one. First off, I would like to\ncomment on something I am sure everyone has already heard. Heath Ledger. His acting in this movie was the best. He took\nthe character, and made it his own. I love to see actors go above and beyond the task of reading lines, and add in a bit\nof life. His character was believable, as well as creepy. I know that I personally was affected every time he read a\nline. He stole the show for me.Secondly, I think that the script was one of the best. True human nature was perfected by\nit. I also, once again, loved the Joker. His part itself made me fall in love with this movie.The only thing that\nirritated me was (spoiler) 1. The fact that two-face did not get much screen time 2. And once two-face was made, the\nmovie seemed to drag on a little, and then you realize that it is not the end, and the movie speeds up a little.All in\nall, this is one of my favourite movies, and everything from the costumes to the characters was superb. 10/10!",

I thought the storyline involving those who pretended to be Batman was quite compelling in\nthat Bruce indeed became the symbol he intended to be in Batman Begins. The story presents some fantastic ethical\ndilemmas to those caught in The Jokers \"jokes;\" the sequence involving the boats was emotionally powerful while not\nfocusing on the main characters at all.

The story behind the Jokers\nbackground is a different from the original comic story line but very interesting. The explanation from the Joker\nhimself does not disappoint. Gotham is corrupt, dark and so are a good many of the public servants. You cant trust\nanyone. This movie is awesome.

Wayne Manor and the Batcave from Begins are cooler\nand darker than the penthouse and way to bright room where Batman now keeps his gear.2. I do not like seeing Batman walk\naround sort of hanging out with the police because it cheats the mystery of Batman a lot like Kilmer and Clooneys\nBatmans.3. There could of been more time with Batman fighting people. I think the ending sequence of Begins was more\npumping than the ending of the Dark Knight.Aside from these few minor and practically non existent issues, The Dark\nKnight was a fantastic movie from beginning to end and I cant wait until Nolan makes another one.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers.",
    "reviewBody": "A new villain is in town and hes a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop\nhim, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to\nsee a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything\nthat a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a\nride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is\nthe comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York.\nVery bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on its head and delivers a raw,\nrealistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book\nadaptations.Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in\nthe role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people\ndo not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every\nlittle quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the\ncharacter. Its safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. Its a\nshame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.Thats not\nto say that everyone else isnt good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman.\nEven with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple\nlooks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen\ntime here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that\ndoesnt conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has\nthe most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to\nbelieve the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his accident. Finally\nGyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesnt get enough screen time to\nbring it to us. Again, its sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.Everything\nabout this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or\none dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back\nwhen these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous.\nEvery line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines\nmore chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and\nanything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action\nthen its predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isnt your Adam West Batman. This is Nolans\nBatman.Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are\nset back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You\ndont need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this.\nI found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in\nawe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky\nfilm, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. Hes a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the\nlimit, to his breaking point.There are some minor setbacks though. I wasnt too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong.\nTrims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as\ntoo many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.The Dark\nKnight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath\nLedger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens\nin this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in\nsome cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud.\nThis is a perfect example of what a film should be.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike",
    "reviewBody": "Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and\nSpiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally\nimpressive Batman. \"The Dark Knight\" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are\nspectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy\nchases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the films 2 hour running time, the movie\nseems tight and has little excess.Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and\nsupporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and\nreassuring as another of Bruce Waynes employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of\nthe equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the\ncentral role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all\nthat a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then,\nof course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledgers performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a\ncrude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is\ndelivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls\nhis eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured\nagainst \"The Dark Knight.\" From Batmans stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening\ncinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a\nsterling cast and a gifted director, \"The Dark Knight\" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a\ncomic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults\nwho may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman.",

    "reviewBody": "I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is\nbarely a superhero movie; its utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all\nmeans. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the\nstory, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledgers death which I feared might make\nthe movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is\na wonderful actress as Katie Holmes replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was\nrather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the\nleast, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for\nhis performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own\nthespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined\nto have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You dont have to\nbe a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless\nbubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid\nfooting in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight was setting records even before its release. The hype was on since late 2007, and was only fueled by the\nsudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger in January. Did The Dark Knight live up to the massive expectations? Yes.\nDefinitely.The story progresses very well, and the 2 and half hour running time flies by. Pay attention though, or you\nmay get lost.The action is plentiful, and there is just the right amount. Not too much, not too little. There arent too\nmany explosions just for show, and the special effects look great.Performances Christian Bale is spot on as the\ntormented defender of Gotham. He gives a very believable performance in one scene of raw emotion that I wont spoil\nhere.Michael Caine once again plays Alfred in a role that makes him a mentor/friend even more so than in Begins, or any\nof the older movies for that matter.Morgan Freeman also reprises his role as Lucius Fox, who once again supplies Bruce\nwith the gadgets and cutting-edge technology he needs to combat crime.Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes from\nBatman Begins, plays Rachel Dawes, a pivotal character in the movie, and in the lives of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent.\nEven if you think Gyllenhaal may not be much of a looker, she certainly has far more charisma than Holmes in the\nrole.Newcomer Aaron Eckhart debuts in the series as Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, and a shining ray of hope on\nthe corrupt Gotham City. Batman thinks he may be the man who may make Gotham no longer need Batman. However, fans of the\ncomics know who he is destined to become.And last, but most certainly not least, Heath Ledger.From the trailers alone, I\ncould tell he was going to give a commanding performance, but I was not expecting this. Ledger completely disappears\ninto the role, and is virtually unrecognizable. He easily gives the best performance of the movie as the psychopathic,\nsadistic Joker. It is unfortunate and sad he will not be able to reprise his role in the third film, if there will be\none.The Dark Knight is easily the best film of the year so far, and by far the darkest. I wont say much, but dont be\nsurprised if you dont get a happy ending.In my opinion, the best film of the year, and the best Batman and superhero\nmovie ever.",

    "reviewTitle": "Who ever said becoming was better than become?",
    "reviewBody": "Its an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the\noriginal--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT\nsquashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and\nexcitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre.\nChristopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible. BATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Waynes roots and his journey\nto becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is\nstill solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dents (an excellent Aaron Eckhart)\ncrusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a\nhero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what\nsupplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the films dark turns all the more poignant and\nsuspenseful. Everything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable)\nto the violence (the Jokers disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath\nLedger. If Ledger hadnt died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldnt\nhave been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still wouldve been higher than the skies. To say that his\nperformance is majestic isnt enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowells astonishing\nperformance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that\n\"Ive never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma.\" That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who\nseems so comfortable with his madness its truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, \"this mustve\nbeen what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died.\" Ledger will become\na cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his\nexquisite madness, youre able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what\nwill remain.The only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes\ngot a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom\nCruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generations answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is\nactually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruces life,\nits awkward to have another actress cast in that role. Its like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman\nfalling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and\nsomewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and its only a minor annoyance to a\npractically perfect movie.This is the film weve all been waiting for, and its the film we deserve. I hope you all take\nin the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is\nlost, but with this film, itll never be forgotten.",

    "reviewTitle": "Lets be honest - They should just call this movie \"The Joker\"",
    "reviewBody": "Lets get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath\nLedgers Joker makes Jack Nicholsons Joker look like Cesar Romeros Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this\nJoker actually feels dangerous. Every moment hes on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this\niconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and\nprobably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. Its really quite a\nshame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again. Does the rest of the\nmovie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... Its got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good\nscript for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly: If they have to recast Rachel\nDawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bales gruff \"Batman\" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and\nalmost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due\nto the involvement of \"Two-Face.\" This film didnt need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the\naudience wish theyd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. Ive never cared for the character, and I suppose its\ngood they didnt wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didnt do anything for me. Aside\nfrom those aspects, however, its difficult to find much to criticize in this movie. I struggled greatly with the rating\nfor this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But\nLedgers Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating.\nForget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.",

The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most\nriveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache. This is a film that never lets go of its\nmomentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie.Do not\ntreat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many \"Aces\"\nin the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let\nhim grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be\nremembered for years to come.\"The Dark Knight\" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story\nbetween good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective\nmotives.Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the\nsacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the\nmovie reaches its pinnacle.There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic.In simple words. It is a\n10 on 10 and must see.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time!",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is the follow-up to 2005s Batman Begins. Now I thought Batman Begins was amazing, I mean it is one of\nmy favorite films of all-time. To sum it up, I was very pumped about the sequel, but there was always that fear in the\nback of my mind that The Dark Knight might not be as good as Batman Begins, but finally after three years of waiting I\ncan say that The Dark Knight is not just as good as Begins, but it in fact blows it out of the water. The story of The\nDark Knight follows Batman on his continuing crusade to rid Gotham City of crime. In this film Batman begins to see hope\nfor both him and Gotham in the hopes of the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Batman feels that Gotham needs a hero\nwith a face, and he believes that Dent is that hero, not Batman. Of course, Batmans hopes are soon shattered by the\narrival of a new criminal mastermind calling himself the Joker.As I have already said, The Dark Knight is amazing, you\ncould call it a masterpiece, but that just doesnt seem to fully sum up how blown away I was by this film. To start, the\ndirecting by Christopher Nolan is superb, reinforcing once more that he is quite possibly the film industries greatest\ncurrent filmmaker. On top of that the cinematography by Wally Pfister is amazing, and I really think it is about time he\nfinally wins an Oscar for his work. Then the score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is perfect, fitting each scene\nperfectly. Finally the script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is perfect, flowing perfectly from scene to scene,\nmaking this 2 and a 1/2 hour film feel as if it lasted only 90 minutes, but in a good way. Of course the true highlight\nof the film is the acting from the all-star cast, all actors turn in perfect performances, including: Christian Bale as\nBatman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred the\nButler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllennhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes; though the one\nperformance that truly stands out ahead of the others is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, he was amazing, this role\njust fit him like a glove, and he truly deserves a post-humous Oscar win.In final thought, the Dark Knight is epic,\nemotional, and exciting, all at the same time. I loved this film, it was tense and disturbing while being at times a\nlittle comical through the Jokers odd, dark sense of humor. I could go on all day long talking about how perfect this\nfilm was, but Ill try to wrap things up here. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of 2008, and should definitely be\nconsidered for some big-time Oscars, in particular Heath Ledgers stunning performance as the Joker; but not only is The\nDark Knight the years best film, it is the best film of the decade thus far. The Dark Knight is the Greatest Comic Book\nFilm of All-Time, and definitely stands in my books as one of the Greatest Films of All-Time. It is a true\nmasterpiece.The Dark Knight earns a perfect 10 out of 10!",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight became the third movie Ive gone to a midnight showing for (the other two being Revenge of the Sith and\nKingdom of the Crystal Skull) and it was by far the best of those films. The energy in the auditorium was palpable.\nThere were times when we collectively gasped, laughed, and cheered.For fans of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is\ngrittier, funnier, and more complicated. As a matter of fact, the films only drawback is the complicated storytelling.\nIt made the film two and half hours long, and, moreover, it felt two and a half hours long. Also, the PG-13 rating in\nAmerica, is quite serious. There are some truly gruesome images and Heath Ledgers Joker is one of the most menacing\nvillains ever to appear on the screen. One villain in the host of supporting baddies who got the short end of the stick\nin the last film and in this one, was Cillian Murphys Scarecrow. I almost wish theyd left him out entirely, instead of\ngiving the boy a lousy send-off twice, because Murphy could be a fantastic villain in the third film, in my opinion,\nanyway.The rest of the returning cast is fantastic, as expected. Christian Bale is perfect as Gothams self-sacrificing\nDark Knight, and he also did a great job with the billionaire playboy side of Bruce Wayne. The banter between Bale and\nMichael Caine is pitch perfect and is responsible for one of the funniest scenes in the film. Morgan Freeman and Gary\nOldman are also given a chance to shine in this film. Oldman was especially fantastic as Jim Gordon. Aaron Eckhart is a\ngreat Harvey Dent, and I have an easier time with the chemistry between him and Maggie Gyllenhaal than between\nGyllenhaal and Bale. While Maggie Gyllenhaal is her usual great self, its difficult to pretend that shes Rachel Dawes,\nnot only because shes not physically Katie Holmes, but shes practically playing a different character. Suspension of\ndisbelief only goes so far.Overall, it was a fantastic film and a great second installment. My only question is, how\nwill they top themselves for the third one?",

    "reviewBody": "Watching the various Batman incarnations over the years, from the Adam West era, through the Superfriends, Tim Burton\nand Friends, and the very excellent Bruce Timm Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, we are faced with various\nversions of the Joker.The Animated Series Joker was voiced by Mark Hamill, and is considered by many fans to be the best\nJoker up to now. He certainly is creepy, and in the film spin-offs he does actually murder people explicitly on\noccasion, but though he is good its hard to imagine him existing outside of the art deco alternate universe of Bruce\nTimm. Hes just not unpredictable enough. He has steady henchmen who trust him enough to turn their backs on him.Jack\nNicholsons Joker was well-received at the time, but he too suffered from a believability gap, in addition to being over\nthe top and, while crazy, not quite creepy.Enter the Dark Knights Heath Ledger: the freak make-up, the crazy, but\ndisturbingly lucid philosophy, the complete lack of empathy for other people, and the scary practice of killing people\nfor fun and without warning, his fondness for knives. I can actually imagine running into a character like this in a\ncity somewhere. Certainly, not quite as complete, the real-life version wouldnt have the smarts to pull off so many\ngrand schemes along with all the pure evil traits (you hope), but there are a small number of people out there who share\nsome of the Jokers characteristics, and thats what makes Ledgers character so creepy, so scary.Every scene he is in,\naccompanied by music that would feel at home in any Hitchcock or horror film, is filled with a sense of tension and\ndread. What horror will he next bring upon the people standing before him? Whos next? Without a doubt the best Joker\never, Ledgers performance did not feel at all like a comic book superhero movie bad guy. I was thinking more like\nHannibal Lechtur. Intelligent, lucid, menacing, and, Im convinced, not really insane, but horribly sane, with a\ntendency to view life as pointless and thus amusing.Oh, yeah, the rest of the movie? That was good, too. Eckharts\nHarvey Dent was also very satisfying, with no campiness to bring it down. His trajectory from ace prosecutor to criminal\nTwo-Face is very well-done. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, and Gyllenhall are all well-cast. The action is better than\nBatman Begins, with the fistfight scenes in particular being easier on the eyes, with less spastic camera motion. The\nwriting and direction is more along the lines of a crime drama or an action film than a comic book adaptation, and the\nstory starts off with action and keeps you going for the whole 2.5 hours.Very dark, violent, and very well-done film all\naround.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Towering Achievement",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolans \"The Dark Knight\" reminds us that even a product of mass-market pop-culture can, if done correctly,\nbe a work of art. This thrilling, densely plotted and beautifully crafted sequel to 2005s \"Batman Begins\" is, quite\npossibly, the finest comic book superhero movie ever made. In addition, it boasts, in the performance of Heath Ledger,\none of the definitive screen villains of all time.As the movie begins, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) -\nwith the unofficial aid of the \"vigilante crime fighter\" known as Batman (Christian Bale) - is getting ready to indict\nmost of Gotham Citys most notorious criminals and gangsters on racketeering and money-laundering charges. The fly in\nthe ointment is the psychotic, face-painted super villain, self identified as The Joker, whos joined forces with the\nseedy criminal elements of the city to bring both Batman and the terrorized inhabitants to their knees. Meanwhile,\nbillionaire Bruce Wayne is trying to find a way to render his Batman alter ego unnecessary by finding an incorruptible\ncivic leader who will be able to rid the city of its criminal elements through wholly legal means and, thus, become the\nheroic figure for the city that Batman himself can never be. He alights on Dent as the man for that job.As writers, the\nNolan brothers, Jonathan and Christopher, have created a work that is so dark and despairing in its probing of the evil\nthat infests our world that it makes the 1989 Tim Burton version look like an episode from the campy TV series in\ncomparison. The forces of good in this movie are entirely at the mercy of the forces of evil, so terrifyingly embodied\nin the Joker figure. With his face painted into a ghoulish grin, Ledgers Joker strikes terror not merely into the\ncharacters in the movie but the audience as well. Not since Anthony Hopkins did his turn as Hannibal Lecter (a character\nLedger himself cited as a primary source of inspiration for this role) has one actor imparted such a quality of dread\nand menace to the character he was playing. It is, indeed, a tribute to Ledgers greatness as an actor that, even after\nall the myriad screen villains we have encountered over the years, he has the power to makes us cringe every time he\nappears on screen. Indeed, so convincing is Ledger in the part that we sometimes wonder if even Batman himself will have\nwhat it takes to defeat him (and isnt that the measure of a truly effective bad guy?). For this Jokers true strategic\nadvantage lies not in all the weapons of destruction he has at his disposal, but, rather, in his astute understanding of\nhuman psychology, particularly in his knowledge of how to make terror and fear work to get him what he wants. His\ndelight in mind games, his devotion to torture, and his love of violence for its own sweet sake make him a figure fit to\nhaunt ones dreams.There are other fine performances as well in the movie, including Eckhart as the honest D.A., Maggie\nGyllenhaal as Bruces former (and the D.A.s current) flame, Gary Oldman as the ever reliable Lieutenant Gordon, Morgan\nFreeman as Wayne Industries most erstwhile employee, and Michael Caine as Waynes devoted and down-to-earth butler.\nIts inevitable, perhaps, that Bale, as the good guy of the piece, would fall under the shadow of Ledgers towering\nachievement, but he provides the strength and solidity the picture needs to keep it from going out of whack.Using what\nwould appear to be a minimum of CGI effects, Nolan has mounted his film with a fine eye for detail and a great deal of\njaw-dropping visual artistry. The cityscapes alone are enough to take the audiences breath away. Moreover, the\nscreenplay weaves seamlessly between full-throttle, pull-out-all-the-stops action sequences and intense, highly intimate\nexchanges between characters.Like all movies that run a little longer than they should, \"The Dark Knight\" does hit a\npoint of diminishing turns long about its last half hour, as the story loses its way a bit and the thematic point-making\nthreatens to run it into the ground. Heck, even Ledgers performance loses some of its edge towards the end, as the\nnovelty begins to wear off due to overexposure (he is probably in one or two scenes too many in the final\nanalysis).Still, these are minor quibbles about a movie and a performance that will go down as classics in their\nrespective categories.",

    "reviewTitle": "Fire in the Knight",
    "reviewBody": "Gotham city has seen better days.The Jokers terror campaign has both the public, and even its criminals living in fear.\nOne day, Alfred relates a story of his early days in Burma, to a ponderous Bruce Wane. He tells Mr. Wayne how he and his\nmen began to hunt a jewel thief who was on a killing rampage in the jungle. A man who actually threw the jewels he stole\naway, because this was just a man \"who wanted to watch the world burn.\"Bruce asks Alfred how did they catch him?\"We\nburnt the jungle down.\"The opening images of Batman announces this theme of fire, with the Bat signal simmering among\nblue flames. Gotham has indeed seen better days. And the opening of the film announces, better days are not coming soon.\nAs the joker announces, \"people will die tonight, Im a man of my worrrrd.\" Oh yes, the jungle is going to burn down, by\none hand or the next.In the Dark Knight Christopher Nolan clearly strove to do justice to the Batman character and the\nworld he inhabits to degrees and depths of character rarely seen before in a \"comic book\" movie. He has delivered a true\nepic. Though he still hasnt a clue how to film fight scenes and also dances a fine line of too much story and too many\ncharacters. There was obviously more than enough material here for two movies. However, I am very happy things worked\nout as they did. The movie is a triumph of vision both in the new realization of the joker, and in the practical\nmanifestation of the Two-Face character. Aaron Eckhart is sufficiently pretty and viscous as Harvey Dent. Heath Ledger\nis hilariously creepy, yet I feel both probably deserved a little more screen time. Again, Nolan was juggling a high\nwire act with all these characters and themes, but yes again, I feel he was almost without fault in doing so. Both of\nthese characters will be remembered. With the Joker, Jack Nicholsons turn in 1989s Batman was menacing and funny. A\nbravura performance for sure. But I think there was a touch of nostalgia, and tongue in cheek humor in how he played the\nrole to keep him from being frightening. Heath Ledger, on the other hand has succeeded in bringing a more truthful\nversion of the Jokers homicidal rage from the comic to the screen. Ledgers Joker is funny, but not \"haha\" funny. There\nare no hand buzzers or whoopie cushions here. Hes really something to behold on screen and I feel both Batman movies\nportrayals can live side by side in their interpretations for some time to come. Famously modeled in some way after\nMichael Manns \"Heat,\" with Gotham city as the protagonist, the Dark Knight is a chase film of double crosses and\nrevenge killings. It widens the narrative scope of the Batman Begins story-line and confronts the realities of one mans\nmission and principals to make right, what was once very wrong. This is a film, a true epic film, that engages Batman in\na grand struggle against evil, some of which is his own making. Much like in Nolans \"The Prestige,\" the idea of\n\"getting your hands dirty\" reminds us of the type of world that created Batman in the first place; a dark world of\nshadows and shades of gray. The Dark Knight is a poem of nobility and justice; a story about the futility and illusions\nof control. This is a story of the struggle between two sides of the same coin. One man who wants to burn the jungle\ndown and another who will burn the jungle down to stop him. In the concluding soliloquy Batman says, \"people deserve\nsomething better than the truth.\" I couldnt agree more. America too has seen better days and this Batman is wondrous\npure fiction at the right time. Its a venture down the obscured paths of humanity about a Knight among the darkness.\nYou bet this is better than the truth. This stuff is why we go to the movies in the first place.",

    "reviewTitle": "A gritty hard-boiled thriller that will leave you breathless and wanting more",
    "reviewBody": "Words cannot describe the awe I feel for The Dark Knight.I usually try and wind myself down before getting too hyped\nover movies, but The Dark Knight was different. This was a Batman movie, almost completely like no other.Somehow,\ndespite being immensely hyped for it, The Dark Knight basically shattered all of my expectations and more.The film\nfocuses on four different characters. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is still playing the vigilante Gotham loves and\nfears, but is wrestling with his commitment to the job. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is one of the few good cops left,\nand is trying to end the crime. Newly elected District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fighting against the scum\nof Gotham, and trying to make it a safe place again. And of course, theres The Joker (Heath Ledger), a psychopathic\nterrorist determined to ensure chaos rules Gotham City.The film handles these plot threads rather delicately. It knows\nthat with the slightest force, it could throw the entire course of the film off. For every moment of greatness these\nstories development, it reverts and dodges bumpy, clich-ridden paths. It works because it aims to be unique the whole\nway through. Writer/director Christopher Nolan (with the help of his brother Jonathan) bit off a lot putting this movie\ntogether, but in their dedication to detail and to an inherently complex story, it manages to feel simplistic (and\nsomehow manages to add a bit of emphasis on smaller plot lines involving mobsters and a love triangle between Wayne,\nDent and fellow D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Batman Begins horrendously weak link Katie Holmes)).But\nin accomplishing the complete synthesis of the main plot lines, the Nolan brothers have also managed to make a truly one\nof a kind film. Yes, it does build off some ideas from Begins, but it does not depend on them. This film is one that can\ntruly stand on its own, and is an exceptional enough sequel that you do not necessarily need to see the first film to\nunderstand what happens here (although it sure does help). It tells its own story, and relies very little on previously\nrelated materials. It is what every good sequel should set out to be like. And thankfully, it revels in all the\ncorruption and darkness that the Batman films should have always been about. The grittiness and fearlessness of this\nfilm is unlike almost any comic book film ever made, and I doubt it will soon be replicated.But in creating such a\nscreenplay, there is an inherent issue with length. Batman Begins felt a bit too longwinded, and could have rather\neasily been trimmed. The Dark Knight on the other hand, while it feels too long for true comfort, does not have any\nbulky areas. It is very spot-on with its scenes, and nearly every scene has a reason to be in the film. If anything was\nto be done away with, I think the film would have been a much less and not so fulfilling effort (not to mention would\nlose its thrilling edge it keeps up for the entirety of the movie). So while it does feel a bit too lengthy, it lacks\nthe superfluous nature that films like these usually have. I could have appreciated a few changes made to a near ending\naction sequence (as it felt a bit too ridiculous and rushed for its own good), but it could have been a whole lot\nworse.Another area the film shines in is the impeccable special effects. Every last detail is perfect, and not once did\nI not believe what I was seeing. It amps up everything Begins had, and makes it better. Specific scenes that would have\nlooked horrendously fake years ago look miraculous here. And the speed fighting that plagued Begins has disappeared to a\ncertain extent, leaving the audience a much better way of seeing the action. And of course, the makeup to bring both\nvillains to life (especially a certain Two-Faced character) is beyond extraordinary. It is downright terrifying for\nhow real it looked, at any time.Acting wise, everyone does a fairly great job.Bale, while overshadowed more so than last\ntime, builds upon his pathos-ridden superhero and brings certain three-dimensionality to him. We can see the hurt in his\neye, and can see the pain. Even when the majority of his face is covered, he brings an excellent sense of emotion to the\ncharacter. Much the same goes for Eckharts Harvey Dent, who spends most of the movie doing what he thinks is right. He\nis a boy scout for the ages, and delivers a richness and depth to the character I did not think possible. Oldman does\nanother superb job playing Gordon. He was an anchor in Begins, and here he does even more work.Gyllenhaal, while a much\nbetter thespian than Holmes, is not given nearly enough to do here. She is not totally useless, but she looks and sounds\nheld back by the confines of the role. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are used very sparingly as well, but when they\nappear, they do a great job.Which leaves me with Ledgers Joker.Just about everything you have heard about his portrayal\nis true. He is a complete psychopath, and is totally unrecognizable in the role. You may laugh at some of his\nshenanigans, but then will take them back when you see the horrifying things he says and does. This brilliant\nperformance is even better than I could have hoped, and is enough to see the movie alone. He may have died, but you will\nwish he would come back and start acting the moment he opens his mouth.For its small amount of problems, The Dark Knight\nstill manages to be uncompromising in its uniqueness and greatness. It will leave you breathless, and craving more.9/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Why calling this \"The best superhero movie to date\" is an understatement",
    "reviewBody": "To talk about the strengths of \"The Dark Knight\" as a superhero film and why its probably the best superhero film yet,\nwould be to sell it incredibly short. This film is more than about satisfying comic book fans, action junkies and thrill\nseekers: it is a gripping tale of corruption, crime and justice that tries mightily to pry at an understanding of human\nnature. Director and writer Christopher Nolan has made his case for why the superhero genre can be just as capable of\ndelivering a view and critique of society as a crime drama--and still leave room for a plenty of explosive entertainment\nfor dessert.Of course \"Dark Knight\" is no \"The Godfather\" (though Bales Batman voice often becomes as raspy as Marlon\nBrandos), but its still wildly successful at addressing crime in its own way-- through impeccable and frightening\ncharacters like The Joker and scene after scene of chaos and mayhem. Unlike its predecessor \"Batman Begins,\" this film\npaints a grimmer Gotham City that feels more like real life and less like the pages of a comic book--and it echoes\nthroughout all aspects of the film. Chicago proves an excellent city to serve this purpose too and its amazing what\nthey allowed this crew to do in their streets.No worries though, the real life feel doesnt sacrifice the thrills of a\nsuperhero action film. Nolan and his crew do unbelievable stunt work (the CGI is incredibly scarce) and The Joker\nschemes up some stuff that results in terrific fight scenes and action sequences, all of which are way better than the\nfirst \"rebirth of Batman\" installment. The script, though true to the constantly thematic-focused material of \"Begins,\"\nis also more sophisticated and even less cheesy this time around. Its sheer genius and best of all--it doesnt try and\ndo too much like so many over-hyped superhero films before it.The story takes place with Gotham back in a place of\ncorruption, but when new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) shows up and starts putting guys behind bars (with some\nhelp from Batman and Lt. Gordon (Oldman)) the crime lords turn to The Joker (the late Heath Ledger, whose performance\nwill go down in the books and define his short but excellent career) in order to put an end to it. The only thing is\nthat they dont understand The Joker-- hes motivated by pure desire for chaos and that will make him Batmans most\nformidable foe.With the amount of intriguing characters and great actors involved, the focus shifts away from Bruce\nWayne in this movie and it becomes more about identifying Batmans role in the crime-fighting puzzle. This focal shift\nmakes \"Dark Knight\" a true ensemble piece. When The Joker is on screen, you wont take your eyes off of him. Ledger\ncaptures his chaos, his theatricality, his crude sense of humor and channels it towards the themes the script pushes.\nHis lines are the best in the film and not only in delivery but pure craftsmanship. Hes the glue of this film--not\nBale/Batman. Eckhart is an excellent Harvey Dent and a solid Two-Face. Filmgoers (specifically Batman fans) should know\nthat his role is very central to the film and his emergence as Two-Face ends up being the whipped cream and the cherry.\nNot only do you get the story of a strong hero challenged by an incredibly complex villain, but you get an origin story\nof a man turning from good to evil. No superhero writing team has ever put so much complexity into a script and made it\nwork without becoming a disappointing train wreck, but the Nolan brothers do. There are some bumps, but youre so sucked\nin it doesnt matter.So its easy to label \"The Dark Knight\" the best superhero film to date, because it delivers\neverything you want with an artists touch on every piece of it. What I will dare to say is this film is one of if not\nthe best crossover between entertainment and crime drama. Combine that with the most successful and biggest viral\nmarketing campaign ever and this film has changed the way we watch movies. But most specifically, Its thematically\nbulletproof and those who love superhero movies that explore the deepest depths of its themes will easily name \"The Dark\nKnight\" one of their favorite films.",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark, sinister, haunting. More than a comic book movie.",
    "reviewBody": "Yes, its true. Hes done it. After reviving the Batman brand three years ago, Christopher Nolan has done the\nunthinkable. The impossible. Not only has he outdone himself and the wildest of expectations, but Nolan has created a\ncomic book movie that transcends the limits of its genre to become something so much more. So dark, so sinister. The\nDark Knight is a masterpiece, and it has all the makings of a timeless classic. Not merely a movie about good versus\nevil, but about the evil born out of good. And the toll it takes on those who fight it.Theres no doubt that the mind of\nChristopher Nolan is a dark place. Weve seen it before, which made Nolan an interesting choice to pick up the broken\nfranchise. Did they comprehend exactly what they were getting themselves into? Probably not. Needless to say, one\nstudios gamble has been our tremendous gain. Batman Begins was a remarkable re-visioning of the Caped Crusaders\nroots, but it is with The Dark Knight that Nolan unleashes his twisted fury with impeccable precision and horrific\nbrilliance. He aims high, far and above what any other superhero has ever tackled before. The results are\nstartling.Saving a city, protecting innocent people, questioning your habits. This is not foreign territory that The\nDark Knight is invading, but it doesnt seek out the easy answers. Christian Bale once again inhabits the bat costume,\nand he delivers an exquisite performance of a sincere man, but a tortured soul. The moral dilemmas presented to us run\ndeep, as Bruce Wayne doesnt simply battle his inner demons, but a worldview that breeds chaos and thrives on anarchy.\nWhere good men trying to do the right thing can be brought down to the depths of hell, that within us all lies a savage\nand barbaric beast. Dog eat dog.Yes, thats the Joker. A nihilistic psychopath, youre not sure whether you should\nchuckle at his clever gestures or shudder in eerie fear. It was a role that would have made him the superstar he\ndeserved to be, a role that would forever carry his name. Heath Ledger did not live to see his brilliant work on the big\nscreen, but he would be proud. He really is that good. Its evident he went to a very dark place to construct this\nmalicious Joker, and he will always be remembered for delivering one of the most haunting, disturbing performances ever\nput to screen. Chaos for the sake of chaos, mass destruction for a little bit of fun and disorder.The Dark Knight\nsoars among some of the best crime dramas ever told. A skillfully complex story that serves not only as an adrenaline\nrush of pure entertainment, but home to many profound ideas of power, politics, corruption, and the simple decency of\nmankind. Nolan uses Gotham City as a universal concept, not a crime-ridden city patrolled by a man in a bat costume that\nexists purely in the mind of its creator. It reaches across into our world, and effectively says something very powerful\nand unsettling about our morality. Harvey Dent sadly represents all of these things, and through the help of the very\ntalented Aaron Eckhart, gives a face to these troubling but necessary ideas.The Dark Knight will get under your skin,\nand it should. It isnt satisfied with simply being one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comic book movie ever\nmade, it goes even further into a land rarely occupied by cinema but reserved only for the best. On the outside, The\nDark Knight is everything a summer blockbuster should be. The action is thrilling, the air of suspense is thick, the\nproduction values are top-notch and gorgeous to watch and look at. But underneath lays a core with many complicated\nlayers, and Nolan is just getting started. The Dark Knight will haunt you, it will linger in your memory. The\nfreakishly twisted villains, a hero nobody wants. This is an unforgettable film, a masterful accomplishment whose own\nambition is stunning and timely. Christopher Nolan is trying to tell us something, and hes using Batman to tell that\nstory. Do yourself a favor and listen.More reviews at\nrottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276view=public",

    "reviewTitle": "I had high expectations and they were met, if not exceeded.",
    "reviewBody": "Leading up to seeing this movie, I had read dozens of reviews, mostly of praise for \"The Dark Knight\". But amongst the\npraise was critiques, and there were many reviews with the same critiques, making me worried this movie would only be\ngood because of its flaws. One of the mentioned flaws was that this film was very slow paced. I dont know what movies\nsome reviewers saw, but though this is long, it is not slow paced, in fact, you could say its the exact opposite.\nEspecially towards the beginning, this is a fast paced movie, with lots of action. Along with that, its one of the best\nmovies of the year, and though it may sound clichd to say this in a Dark Knight review, Heath Ledger will be remembered\nfor this role, if any, as his finest moment(s) on the silver screen.Gotham City is in peril, and the only person who can\nsave it is...Harvey Dent. New District Attorney Harvey Dent is bringing men to justice and throwing them in the clink,\nsometimes by the hundreds. Harveys got a great girl, Bruce Waynes (Christian Bale) old flame, Rachel Dawes (Now played\nby Maggie Gyllenhall). The Joker (Heath Ledger) is the new psycopath in town, and Batman, or Harvey Dent must stop\nhim.What makes the Dark Knight so great is how well it works as both a superhero movie, and an action drama. If this\nwasnt a Batman movie, it would still be a fantastic action flick, not to say Batman is a throw away character, because\nhe certainly isnt. The direction is very good, though there are a few action scenes that could have been filmed\nbetter.Heath Ledger is the performance that makes the movie, not because this was the movie that led to his unfortunate\ndemise, but because he was amazing and captivating. Whether or not he will win Best Supporting Actor, he still has\ngotten critical acclaim for his portrayal of the psychopath. His performance is not a let down, he is just great. The\nother actors all do well too. Normally I think of Aaron Eckhart as being a B-movie actor, but here he shows what makes\nhim a star. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, and okay as Batman. That annoying scratchy voice is, well, annoying.\nIts overused. Batman even uses it to talk to people that know he is Bruce Wayne. Maybe the suit cuts off his lungs or\nsomething. Maggie Gyllenhall is a fine actress in the role, though for varying reasons it felt a bit off having her\nplaying Rachel. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman added a lot in supporting roles, and Gary Oldman plays a heck of a\nOfficer/Commissioner Gordon.Now onto the negatives. The beginning of the movie had way too many short scenes of random\ncharacters that it felt like an anthology, and it didnt explain itself well enough until later. When the scenes began\nto be longer and stopped jumping from character to character, the movie got much better. One element missing from the\nfilm is drama that connects with the audience. Drama was plentiful, but I never felt connected with the characters\nenough to care what happens, probably because of the fast cut opening that helped to underdevelop the characters until\nlater in the film.I miss Danny Elfman. His musical score brought life to the first two Batman films, and the musical\nscore here is just loud and annoying and adds nothing. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard are talented, so what were\nthey doing here? Overall, this was one of the better Batman movies, and is also one of the best movies of the year. Its\nnot perfect, but perfection is hard to find, and even in its imperfection, it outshines most movies this year.My\nrating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. PG-13 for violence.",

    "reviewTitle": "I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I will see it again and again.",
    "reviewBody": "Best. Batman. Film. Ever.My faith in the Nolans was amply rewarded. After \"Batman Begins,\" I was concerned that\nHollywood had more effect on them than they had on it.But this film had a much better story than the first one, not\nquite as Hollywooded-up as the first one, darker than the first one, and Heath was achingly good. After every one of his\nscenes, I found myself doing a nervous, creeped-out laugh because of his chilling portrayal of madness.The action\nsequences were chaotic, poorly choreographed and boring, except for a couple of times when they focused on clever\nmaneuvers by Batman (good idea, as thats all we really care about, not a bunch of random violent punching and kicking\nnonsense). But the good news is that there were not as many action sequences as I expected -- the story turned on plot,\nnot on what happened with stupid car chases and explosions.I actually wondered, by the end, if the Nolans werent a\nlittle bit making fun of the genre with the way they handled the action. It was a caricature of itself, overblown,\nimpossible to follow and really boring -- and yet the movie was freaking incredible anyway. It kinda shows you that a\ngood superhero film doesnt really need action sequences.Back to the important stuff: the story. The moral tangles that\nunfolded were smart, just a little bit complicated and very nicely handled. Not as much macho-crap bravado and \"honor\"\nnonsense as the first and more actual dilemmas about the consequences of our behavior, both good and bad.The focus on\nmorality combined with the strong story turned what could have been just another good superhero movie into a piece of\ncinema history that transcends its genre -- this is a three-act opera, a tragedy of epic proportions and a dark, nasty\ncomedy.Overall, bravo! And thank you, Nolans. Im glad you did better than \"Begins.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "An Objective Review",
    "reviewBody": "I have never been a comic book fan. The last one I ever read was an \"Archie\" from the 1960s. That being said, I do like\nadaptations of comics and graphic novels. They make great stories and even better movies that even reach the mainstream\naudiences. Recent example like \"Spiderman\", \"Ironman\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\" have shown that these films handle the\ncrossover very well when in the hands of competent direction.I loved \"Batman Begins\". It seemed a much more realistic\nand serious attempt than the earlier \"Batman\" franchise movies. Even with Jack Nicholson as the Joker, those movies came\noff as more silly than fun.SPOILERS*** \"The Dark Knight\" was obviously on my short list of movies coming out this year\nthat I really looked forward to. And overall, I wasnt disappointed. The is a really good movie. It is not, IMHO, an\nexceptional movie.It IS an exceptional performance by Heath Ledger. A true \"tour-de-force\", knock-you-upside-the-head,\nsmile-till-it-hurts performance that makes the film stand out as this summers best. Dead or alive, he deserves the\nOscar and Im betting he will get it, albeit posthumously.You can tell that he totally \"immersed\" himself in the role\nand that might have created the environment that led to his death, as reported. One cant easily move in and out of\ncharacter when one takes it \"so seriously\", pun intended.But as I hinted in my overall enjoyment of the film, this\nperformance alone does not make this an exceptional movie. I realize that the Fanboys are going to take exception to\nthat comment. But if all aspects are looked at objectively, this, I believe, will be the common opinion.Christopher\nNolan takes us on a great ride. He is easily placed near the top of a list of directors who can envision the\ntransformation from comic to film with ease. He tells a great story, fills it with unique action sequences and captures\nthe feel of the darkness that lives and breathes in Gotham City.But it is partly this \"capturing\" that keeps it from\nbeing a truly great film. The overall look of the picture is dark, very dark. Not just visually (which it is greatly)\nbut also in a negative emotional level. Very few scenes show daylight. Very few scenes show hope. And at 152 minutes...\nthats a lot of \"darkness\" for a viewer to experience.Yes, I realize that the movie is called \"The Dark Knight\". And\nthat \"darkness\" was an important factor in \"Batman Begins\" to let the audience feel what it is that drives Bruce Wayne\nto become this hero of the night. But in this episode, it just goes a bit too far. That coupled with Batmans gravely\nvoice (done to extreme by Christian Bale) makes the movie hard to see and hard to hear. My ears arent that great, but\neven someone with perfect hearing is going to have trouble getting all this dialogue, in one viewing, as its often\nmumbled.The other performances are generally up to, or above, what you would expect from such a great line-up. Morgan\nFreeman and Michael Caine, give their usual perfect performances in roles that suit them well. And Gary Olldman is at\nthe top of his form as Commissioner Gordan. This is one of the finer portions of the film as he gets to expand his\ncharacter beyond past entries.Aaron Eckhart, Im sure, did what it was that the director likely wanted for him but his\nperformance is hurt by a mild flaw in the story writing. He plays the new District Attorney Harvey Dent who comes into\ntown on a white horse, ready to take on any and all bad guys at any cost. But in the latter part of the story, he\nsuddenly becomes unable to survive the \"any cost\" part. His love, Rachel Dawes (played sufficiently by Maggie\nGyllenhaal, but not as tenderly as Katie Holmes did) dies near the end and suddenly this White Knight cant see beyond\nthe pain to go after the true culprit in her death. He morbidly becomes \"Two Face\" (arch criminal in some Batman\ncomics?) and blames Gordon and Batman for all his woes. This was the weakest part of the story for me, and I believe\nthat had they left out this plot-line it would have made the movie a bit shorter (which would have helped the overall\npicture) and it would have kept the focus on the duel between Batman and the Joker, and thats where the focus of this\nfilm should never have strayed from. Just as in \"Spiderman 3\", this movie is hurt by 1 too many plot-lines.But these are\nsimply minor annoyances that, although they do detract from the film, simply keep it from being the best Superhero movie\nof all time. That award, I think, still belongs to \"Spiderman\".In conclusion, go see \"The Dark Knight\", you will not be\ndisappointed. And the performance by Heath Ledger is absolutely not to be missed. He makes Jack Nicholsons attempt look\namateuristic, which it truly wasnt. But this one goes so close to perfection that anything pales in comparison.My\nrating for the movie would have been a 7+. add in Ledgers stellar performance (a perfect 10) and we get the movie close\nto a 9. A half point deduction for the \"Two Face\" distraction and the length and darkness of it and we end up at a very\nsolid 8 and 1/2! I know that many fans will think this a perfect 10, and I can understand their point, but they are\nbiased. For the overall movie lover who gets as much enjoyment out of \"WallE\" as he does \"Shawshank Redemption\", this\nmovie will fall somewhere just below those but well above many others.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not just a superhero movie, but an accomplishment in cinema history",
    "reviewBody": "In 2005, British director Christopher Nolan directed \"Batman Begins\" a re-birth of the Batman franchise where not only\nfans get to see the dark side of Gotham City, but also the understanding of how Bruce Wayne came to be.Here, Christopher\nNolan wastes no time with the action...Batman Begins ended with The Joker being the next villain for the next movie, and\nhe, I repeat, he does not disappoint. The late Heath Ledger goes to extreme as the maniacal clown in the beginning of\nthe movie where him and his thugs are robbing the Gotham City Bank; he shows a mean and sadistic side killing people\nleft and right before leaving with the stolen money.Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), on the other hand, is bringing\ndown the criminals one by one with the aid of Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) while joining forces of the new district\nattorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckert). Hes also accompanied with his trusted butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) who\nguides him whether hes Batman or Bruce Wayne and gadgets expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who supplies everything\nthat Batman needs to fight crime while at the same time Bruce is trying to rekindle things with his\nex-girlfriend/district attorney Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllanhall replacing Katie Holmes) while shes going out with\nHarvey Dent.The film itself is a phenomenal from minute one where you cant keep your eyes off of the screen, even\ntouching scenes will get to you. The premise of \"The Dark Knight\" has The Joker taking Gotham City hostage where hell\nexecute and hunt down people one by one unless Batman himself surrenders along with those who want to bring down the\ncriminals. In other words, everybody is a ticking time bomb, including Batman and those around him, where the hero must\nbe everywhere before the menacing clown will strike and not breaking his promise.The action sequences are promising\nwhere Christopher Nolan doesnt use much CGI to make it a true extravaganza. They have the sort of \"Holy Crap\" moments\nwhere your eyes dont want to shield away from the rest of the movie along with seeing if others are okay.As much as\nacting goes, there was not one flaw in each of the performances. Christian Bale is dynamic as the hero where not only is\nhe playing two personas, but bringing human emotion as both the human and the savior. Oldman, Caine and Freeman have\nmuch larger roles where theyre part of the action from secrecy to betrayal; Maggie Gyllanhall wasnt a flaw unlike\nKatie Holmes, and Aaron Eckhart played a convincing Dent, but the true star in this motion picture is Heath\nLedger.Heath, who died at the age of twenty-eight in the beginning of 2008, plays not only one of the sadistic villains\never made on screen but one scary Joker compared to Romero (1960s) and Nicholsons (1989) campiness of the clown prince\nof crime and Mark Hamills (animated Joker) cackling voice where theres no clowning around when it comes to blowing up\nbuildings, using school buses to transport money, killing crime bosses and cops left and right to creating madness all\naround. Hopefully hell receive a posthumous Oscar nomination for his work making him the first actor in a comic book\nmovie to be nominated for an Academy Award.Once again, Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job of making a Batman movie\nwhere he steps it up a notch along with making it the top DC comic book movie ever made. Now whether you agree with my\nreview or not, I really love \"The Dark Knight\".(Note: This is not a typical comic book movie for the young or weak\nhearted)",

I couldnt even get past that the man behind the makeup was Heath. His character is\nabsolute, but very complex, in that, credit to writers, his actions paradoxically have so much meaning. He too\nsymbolizes an ideal, anarchy, and does so breathlessly illustrating his view of the world, that provokes and delivers\nsome forbidden truth.

With the exception of a couple of minutes at the beginning of The Dark Knight (when a little kid started\ntalking to her mom, she was asleep soon after), I could not take my eyes off the screen.This is a truly exceptional\npiece of film making. I will not give anything away by telling you what happens. I have to say though that the acting of\nHeath Ledger is just spectacular. They give him a lot of lines in this movie, probably a lot more than most would expect\nto a comic book villain to get. In fact, this movie has more dialog period than most would expect in this type of movie.\nThat was also the case in Batman Begins, but is even more so in this movie.While Heath was awesome, the other actors\nwere almost as good. The only weak character was Rachel Dawes played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. I thought she was weak in\nBatman Begins, and she is even weaker here. But the strengths of the other characters/actors more than makes up for\nher.Anybody who enjoys these types of movies will love this one. Even if you dont enjoy them, you should see it. Its\nmore than a comic book movie. Nolan has managed to bring so much more to the surface than just special effects and\nexplosions.BTW, if Ledger doesnt at least get a nomination for Best Actor, that will be a shame.

    "reviewBody": "i was immensely disappointed that this movie didnt release in the imax dome in India. but nonetheless i settled in for\nthe first show in a normal sized theater with people waiting in anticipation for Indias most loved super hero. people\nactually came in wearing the bat mask(rarity for India) i was shocked that most of the shows in other theaters were\nbooked. i whistled when the movie started i was like a little girl in a Barbie shop waiting to buy a Barbie she has\nwaited for for 6 months. the movie opens with a shot of Gotham city and throughout the movie we are treated to the\nwonderful pan shots. and at this point may i cite, this movie has no unnecessary shots, every shot speaks distinctively\nfor itself and adds the extra bit to the movie. the acting is excellent. Bale is Batman. i guess there is no one else\nwho can do a more perfect batman than bale. if batman was real he would be giving a standing ovation to bale. ledger,\nthe man everyone has been waiting fro in this movie is fantabulous. he has given joker life, made him real rather than a\nstupid comic book villain. jokers funny but his humor catches you by your you know what and makes you wanna shudder. at\none moment you are laughing and the other moment you realize you shouldnt have laughed, the joke wasnt funny, you\nlaughed because you were scared. thats what he does to you. Aaron Eckhart ... what do you say about him? he is scarier\nthan joker at times. his transition and anger outbursts are terrifying but at the same time remind you that he is\nprobably one of the better actors around who is not duly recognized for his talent. he is terrifying and at some parts\nmore scarier than joker.(his make up or whatever the hell they have done with his face adds to it) his face is horrible,\nyou cant help looking at his eye and wish it stopped moving. also he gives something to the character of harvey dent,\nthe Mr. do good to all and the man who has his own wars to face. he balances these dimensions to his character well. the\nscript is flawless. it got everything right, the dialogs etc etc. Mr. Nolan probably the EST director around take a bow.\nthis is your Oscar. after giving us excellent movies i guess this is your podium speech movie. the movie is chaotic. as\nthe viewer at times you go dizzy trying to understand how can so much havoc be created. but Nolan handles it as though\nits pouring milk in a glass. this movie in the wrong hands would spell MESS i dunno about ledgers Oscar but Nolan should\nget recognized for this movie. watch it and be amazed. be blown away by probably one of the greatest movies ever made",

    "reviewBody": "A lot has already been said about this movie, so Ill try and refrain from the same old comments.If there is too much,\nand not enough at the same time, what is there? Perfection.Ive never seen a movie in which there was so much going on,\nbut it was all so perfect that there wasnt enough of any of it.The plot is so deep and so intricate, and yet so easy to\nfollow. A cavalcade of characters that are so well defined. Every character gets ample time, and yet I wish there was\nmore of everything.The film is so engrossing, and so expansive that I wish it was two movies. I just left wanting so\nmuch more. It gave me everything I expected and much more, and yet, it was so good that I still want more.Its a great\nfilm that is recommended to any fans of crime, drama, action, superhero, or adventure movies.Its not so much for kids\nas there are a lot of adult themes and perhaps too much plot for kids to follow.",

    "reviewTitle": "Oh, we got trouble in Gotham City",
    "reviewBody": "Difficult to assess, this film has ambition--big ambition--beyond an action film. Midway, I thought, \"Oh. This is a\nserious movie.\" That was welcome, but thats not why I got in line. Expecting a slam-bam big summer action film (and it\nis partially that), the film reaches very far into the American and International psyche on the role of evil, the\nfragility of good, the ambivalence of governments on the subject of right/wrong.... Its a longer list than that, but\nNolan strives for something very deep here. Its close to \"The French Connection\" in the intricate plot and reversals of\nthe protagonist who is pushed to abandon his fight for right and seek revenge OR...to find personal happiness OR...to\ncontinue the battle hes begun....About 3/4 of the way through the film, the weight of all of this begins to strain the\ninterest of the audience. However, it never sells itself short like it does the audience. Were \"told\" what the film is\nabout, and I think the screenplay would have been stronger had the audience been left to piece that together for\nthemselves. Catharsis is taken over by the characters and not the audience.Still, theres gobs to enjoy: I found the\nsoundtrack (Zimmer/Newton Howard)splendid. They use a similar device that John Williams used in \"Jaws,\" alerting us that\neither theres a man in a bat suit about to appear or a fellow with a painted smile is about to do something really,\nreally awful.The performances cant be faulted. Christian Bale is suitably brooding in all of this without once\nappealing to our sentiment. And then theres Heath Ledger. After all the build up, you wouldnt think he could live up\nto the hype. Its not a stunt but the embodiment of madness that we see laid out (sometimes to our delight). Finally,\nthough, hes a force that we dread, and thats one of the accomplishments of this film: a cartoon character is fully\nrealized as not just a villain, but all the psychotic terror we see in todays news.Before the film, the projectionist\nannounced that several of the scenes were filmed in Imax, and the screen frame ratio would change. I thought, \"Thats\ngoing to be stupid.\" Its not. When the Imax camera flies through various locations, its breathtaking. The largest\naction set piece (roughly 2/3rds into the film) ups the ante for every action film to follow. Its absolutely stunning.\nIf you think youve seen all the car chases you care to, wait until you see this one (well, its trucks, but the same\nidea).Brilliantly edited, the film never gives us spectacle for its own sake. The cinematography is dark, many of the\nscenes are done in close up, but when the action opens up, were aware this is epic film-making at its best.I would have\nwelcomed 15 minutes cut from the film. While all of the many plots (deviously set up by The Joker) are fine, some went\non just a few minutes too long. Otherwise, dont hesitate to see this. While the audience I was with was mostly male,\n18-50 years of age, the issues it raises are worth the price of admission for anyone. However, the level of violence\n(some of it implied) would make me leave the kids (13 and under) at home. This is a worthy sequel to \"Batman Begins.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "Bob Kane would be so proud!",
    "reviewBody": "this masterpiece was so much more than a batman film, it was clearly one of the best crime-thriller-action- drama\nepics. One of the movies in my list of \"best in the last 5-10 years.\" Far and away the best comic book movie ever made.\nHeath Ledger was awe inspiring as the maniacal, psychopath Joker. If you ever wanted to know how the joker was suppose\nto be played, watching Ledger is basically a character study on how its done. That character is crazed and demented but\nat the same time he will get you to laugh at the things he is doing. Ledger was everything I could ever want out of the\njoker and Jack Nicholsons performance NOW seems more like a Ceasar Romero Joker of the 1960s. Aaron Eckhart was just as\ngood as Harvey Dent /Two Face, his transformation from one to the next was so well done. Christian Bale was once again\nspot on as the Caped Crusader. I loved every part of this cinema masterpiece, there was nothing really flawed about it,\neveryone was on their A game, and that puts it among my all time favorites. One for the ages! Bob Kane would be so\nproud!!",

    "reviewTitle": "The Joker : An Oscarworthy Performance, nothing less and a truly great Batman franchise unfolding.",
    "reviewBody": "Boy, this only gets better and better! First of all, lets NOT compare The Dark Knight to the excellent Batman\nBegins. Begins was just the Beginning, a prequel and never was something different than Knight in a way so as to\ndraw comparisons. It is a continuous process. This, the second of the Batman franchise comes from the acclaimed\ndirector Christopher Nolan unleashing now with it the actual foresight and vision the director must have had in 2005 as\nto how a batman should be when his Begins hit the theaters. The director took and used his time resourcefully in\nBegins to build a crescendo right from the base, to explore what The Batman in fact was.In this movie, as a supporting\nactor Gyllenhaal provided the emotional factor to the plot effectively. Morgan Freeman, a seasoned veteran, exactly\nknows what he has to deliver in a Batman movie in a very short time. As in Begins, here too, he has delivered a crispy\nwitty performance. The other Oscar winner, Caine, was heart-warming as the butler Alfred to provide moral\nsupport/guidance to Bat/Bruce, of course, with his own one-liners. Eckhart was brilliant in his acting as an honest,\ncrime fighting District Attorney but the transformation from a DA to a Two Face was amazingly performed. Compared to\nhim, the Tommy Lee Jones Two Face was a joke. Oscar winner Jones too was capable of doing a much better job than he\nactually did but they never allowed him to. Tragedy is what Two-Face should depict and Eckhart did that successfully.\nGary Oldman has done really well to play a character hanging delicately between his allies and enemies.The\ncinematography was outstanding. The camera angles made me feel like I was flying with the Batman. The background scores\nby Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Lion King, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code) and Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense,\nUnbreakable, Signs) were simply haunting right from the beginning till the end never losing the pace... just like the\nstoryline. The editing was crisp. The action was terrific. The dialogs were simply superb. Bales was a well-balanced\nperformance. What we are looking for is a well trained, well educated, scientific-minded, have-seen-it-all-type, Ninja\nin a Batman movie with emotions under control. So all is well with Bale, The Perfect Batman, the perfect Playboy.And\nnow, to the real Jewel of the movie: Heath Ledger. With all due respect to Jack Nicholson, the three time Oscar\nWinner, he has finally been outclassed by Ledger in playing the role of this particular deadly, psychopathic, psychotic,\nego maniacal, sinister, unconscionable, egregious character of one of the biggest adversaries of Batman known to Batman\nfans: The Chaos-spreading Joker which Nicholson never was, if the aforementioned qualities are compared. This is the\nMind-Chilling-Man-Killing-Lip-Smacking-Smiling Joker we, as Batman fans, have known, read about and imagined. Nicholson\nhas lost the race here to Heath Ledger. The previous franchise really was a comic book franchise ...literally. If they\nreally wanted to make a serious real life metaphor of a comic book, they would have, but they didnt. Otherwise\nNicholson could have also been chilling too. But this franchise is injecting Batman and his adversaries into Real Life\nand vice versa. Just like what The Joker in this movie says: \"This town deserves a better class of criminal... and Im\ngoing to give it to them.\" And truly Ledger has given it to us. Ledger has simply put astonishing life and sadistic\nenergy in The Joker. The Joker here in this movie is like a nightmare come true. I always used to say: nothing gets more\nchilling or colder than Barry Foster in Frenzy (1972), Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs 1991), Kevin Spacey\nin SE7EN (1995), Ralph Fiennes in Schindlers List (1993). But here we can add one more chilling role to the league\nof the best cold-hearted roles executed ever. Ledger has NOW truly put The Joker in the pantheon of the greatest movie\nvillains ever. Watching this performance alone we can easily judge that Ledger, who died so young could easily have\nbecome Oscar material if he had lived. He can still win it as the Best Actor for this role posthumously though because\nhis performance here is demanding one.This also is one of the Best Sequels Ever along with: Godfather II (1974),\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park 3(1999), Lord Of the Rings: The Two\nTowers (2002), Lord Of the Rings: The Return Of The King (2003), Matrix Reloaded (2003), Mission Impossible 3 (NOT 2),\nThe Jason Bourne Series, The Da Vinci Code (2006) - DVC is a sequel to Ron Howards forthcoming Angels and Demons\n(2009). Not only is this the Best Batman movie, this is The Best Superhero movie and one of the best masterpieces ever\nmade. Truly deserves many Oscars with at least the Best Actors. If crime based The Departed can be the Best Picture\n(because Raging Bull, Taxi Driver were better) than this definitely can also be. The previous franchise was literally\ncomic, made for children. This franchise is dark and deep, made for teenagers / adults. And that is what a realistic\nBat-Series meant to be. Based in the REAL world. By that, it does not mean Batman is for real. But he is in a world\nwhere rules of Physics hold true and are not distorted. Two more Batman movies from this franchise and this one will\nwipe out the ill-effects of the previous franchise ... completely.Just like The Joker says to Batman: \"Youve changed\nthings forever. Theres no going back.\" This franchise has changed things forever. Theres no going back.And yes, Long\nLive Ledger (in our hearts). By the way, I was amazed at The Jokers Pencil Disappearing (sick) Trick. Dont Ever Try\nThat At Home. This movie gets a perfect 10 on 10.",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight was definitely one of the funnest times I have had at a movie theatre this year. It was a hell of a\nmovie and very fun. The joker was a very fun character in the movie. The batman was fun as well and didnt disappoint.\nHeath Ledger should definitely win an Oscar for the role he played. He did an amazing job playing the joker. It is very\nsurprising but he might of been the best yet. It was very unpredictable which was nice. The end was very different and\nwill definitely keep you guessing. It kept getting better and better. This will definitely be the best movie of the\nsummer and maybe whole year. Maggie Gylenhaal did a good job but nothing special. Harvey dents character brought a lot\nto this movie. The visuals were amazing throughout. The places the batman and joker went were very cool. There were many\nscenes that were original and different. The messages were great as well and had good heart in it. Honestly after the\nmovie is over it will leave you happy ans shocked. This was an instant classic. A masterpiece in every way possible.\nThis movie should go up for many different Oscars. The acting, best movie of the year, and costume designing was great.\nIt was well worth your money and time. Some people think it was to long but was just perfect. Overall this was one of\nthe funnest movies in a long time.",

It is a crime saga, it is brilliant, it\ncontains one of the best villain performances ever in a movie (yes, Mr. Ledger really is that good), and overall it\nshows what happens when a bunch of dedicated film makers come together and make a film.Every other summer movie that\ncomes out/came out in 2008 is/was crap compared to this. It was funny to me that they were showing a preview for the\nnext Mummy movie...it seems so ridiculous that two such movies could exist in the same world.I dont mean to use this\nreview to bash on other movies, but it really delightful to see such an amazing movie come out of Hollywood. On the\nother side of the coin, it is annoying that other films makers just dont care as much.Christopher Nolan is a genius,\nevery actor in this movie ranges from good to astounding, every explosion looks real, action shots are stunning, and as\nI have already said, The Joker is breathtaking.10/10, this movie is a crime masterpiece, the best comic book movie ever\nmade, and one of the best films to ever have come out during the months of May-August.",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark Knight shines bright!!!",
    "reviewBody": "After sitting in the darkest, dirtiest slums of Gotham City for a little over two and a half hours straight, I still\ndidnt want to go home. \"The Dark Knight\" was brilliant in every way. Although this is the darkest superhero movie to\ndate, the incredible vision of Director Christopher Nolan, the captivating action sequences, the philosophical themes,\nand the pitch-perfect performances delivered by every member of the all-star ensemble made \"The Dark Knight\" shine\nbright, especially, of course, the darkest performance of them all, The Joker, brilliantly played by the late Heath\nLedger.Heath has just been showered with enthusiastic reviews since the early screenings. You cant help but wonder how\ngood Heath can possibly be. After watching the screening on Wednesday, trust me, Heath is so good its scary. You hold\nyour breath in absolute awe with every scene he enters, and linger on his every word. You laugh along because hes\nhilarious, but deep down inside you are terrified. The Joker gets so deep into your psyche you find yourself rooting for\nthe lunatic, and wondering why.Thank God Christian Bale as Batman is just as likable and just as ruthless, and were all\nrelieved that we still have a reason to root for the good guy. Once you get past the phony raspy voice Batman must feign\nto conceal his identity, you will begin to appreciate Christian Bale as the most complicated Bruce Wayne to date, faced\nwith serious cerebral issues, whether hes struggling to find out whats best for the city, what do about his love for\nRachel Dawes, and what the heck is going on in the Jokers crazy cranium.At some point in the movie, every character is\nfaced with a seemingly simple, yet ultimately difficult decision, whats right and whats wrong. For someone like Harvey\nDent, perfectly executed by Aaron Eckhart, everything can be made right. For the Joker, the whole world is wrong.\nThroughout the entire course of the movie, the line between right and wrong gets thinner and thinner, and what ensues is\ncomplete mayhem.\"The Dark Knight\" is a total package. You get an adrenaline-pumping action flick, a suspenseful crime\ndrama, an emotional love triangle, the perfect amount of comedy, and a complete work of art. Round of applause once\nagain for all the performances. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are just naturally likable actors.\nChristian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal continue to impress again and again. And yes, the crowd was\napplauding when Tiny Lister made his appearance (aka Deebo for \"Friday\" fans and Zeus for wrestling fanatics). And sigh,\nHeath Ledger.Jack Nicholsons Joker had a line that haunted me as I grew up watching Tim Burtons film: \"You ever dance\nwith the devil under the pale moon light?\" The new Joker introduces a new question to torment the ages: \"Why so\nserious?\" The eerie monologue that introduces this creepy quote is sure to leave a lasting imprint in the back of your\nmind for years. And Heath Ledger delivers a haunting performance that will join the ranks of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal\nand Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, and will go down as one of the greatest villains, if not the best, ever depicted in\nthe history of film.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Darkest Knight",
    "reviewBody": "I have just returned from one of the most pivotal, exciting, edge-of-my-seat movie-going experiences I have ever had the\npleasure and thrill of attending.This film is by a very colossal margin the most impressive achievement in film making i\nhave seen this year. Perhaps taking on the sole role of Summer Blockbuster, THE DARK KNIGHT: in its length of nearly 3\nhours, is jam packed with Popcorn perfect action, jaw-dropping special effects, and perhaps the most complex, twisted,\nand purely sadistic persona ever captured on film.Immediately, and I mean immediately, the film opens with action,\ncomedy and thrill, and for the next 152 minutes, never lets go for a chance to breathe, because quite frankly, there is\nno room for it in this film that, somehow, builds endlessly like a tightrope and just keeps going, and going, and going\nuntil its explosive, emotional climax, and then it keeps going, and going, and going until its unexpected, bittersweet\nconclusion.Very rich in the special effects department, this film uses many elements that are simply real: props,\nlighting, pyro, and fake elements, using CGI only when absolutely necessary, and it blends in simply beautifully.\nBecause of the films scale, which stretches halfway around the world, along with the seemingly larger-than-life\noccurrences that are pulled off perfectly, this film just looks real. The realism in the personal elements, along with\nthe violence and technology strewn throughout the epic film, adds only more to the films sense of it happening right\nthere in front of you. The people in this film arent just pawns anymore, they are entangled into a complex conundrum of\nthe difference between what is right, and what is fair, a concept deliberated between the so-called Light knight: Harvey\nDent, and the caped crusader himself throughout the entire film up unto its final, grindingly suspenseful moment.Of\ncourse, this personal review would be shamed and incomplete without an analysis on Heath Ledgers jaw dropping,\nsmile-inducing, shock provoking, and mind-bending performance as the twisted, sadistic Joker. From the first moment we\nset eyes on that wretched, nasty face of his, we are clinched in his grasp until the films end. We are NEVER sure or\naware of when he will show his painted face as the film progresses, and sometimes, or should i say no times, is it met\nwith any warning or preparation. You feel almost unsafe in your own theatre, because you are simply out of control, as\nthe viewer it has become impossible to dictate his actions and watch them with little more than a sense of a spectator\nor distant observer. No, you are wrenched in and held down to view his role with every twisted development. Also, a\nspecial hats off to the films music department, headed by James Newton Howard. The Jokers theme is so ear-bending and\ninsanity-ridden, but also excruciatingly simple and low-key, that every time you hear it, you are frightened, scared and\nuncomfortable because it is always accompanying a scene fit for its madness. When you hear it, you will know. Heath\nLedgers performance covers a spectrum so complete and complex that you almost are lost within it at times. He, like his\nname implies, is actually quite rarely joking, comical or cynical in his dealings, even though he commonly refers to it\nas his game. This film is really the first batman piece to really analyze the irony and metaphorical complexities in his\ntitle. That really, he isnt joking, he isnt out for a laugh so much as a sheer, sadistic thrill from seeing chaos\nensue around him, and he gets this until he laughs that teeth-grinding laugh that just beckons for more. He is\nunhesitant, uncaring, and sly to a fine point in his dealings that seem to somehow work their way into the minds of\nGothams police department, and hopefully the batman as well, for as he says, his world has no rules, but Batman has\nonly his one, and the testing of Batmans rule pushes him into the ultimate internal and external battle he can face.\nAnd as an audience member, after it is all said and done, ask yourself if you would have used the same methods against\nthe jokers heartless workings into your soul. The premise that film takes on really does grab you by the throat and\nforce you to think, either then or later. Which is perhaps the main reason i loved this film.THE DARK KNIGHT is a\nspectacle, it is a summer thriller, it is a romantic struggle, and a pure psychological playground. Go prepared.11/10",

    "reviewBody": "This is one of the few sequels that joins that rare pantheon of film which surpasses the original. Terminator 2, Aliens\nand The Godfather II come to mind. TDK joins that illustrious rank.Christian Bale IS Batman. No other actor before him\nhas been able to portray the character as he has been able to. Not to mention he does an excellent job with the playboy\nbillionaire Bruce Wayne.Gary Oldman has a great supporting role as Batmans only ally. Aron Eckhart is also good as\nDent, but I felt the FX for Two-Face did not fit in with the realistic vision Nolan created. But only a minor\ncomplaint.Finally, Heath Ledger. HE IS THE JOKER!!!! The mannerisms, the inflections in his face, his walk, his talk,\nhis look, his dialogs. Everything is perfect. Every detail has been studied by Ledger to create one of the most\nterrifying villains to ever grace the screen. Without a doubt, Heath will posthumously win the Oscar for best supporting\nactor. Without him this movie cannot be elevated to the great sequels of all time.I just hope that the inevitable third\nfilm can live up to this amazing sequel. Nolan will have to work extremely hard to top this magnificent film.",

    "reviewTitle": "To call it the best Superhero film ever made is an understatement!",
    "reviewBody": "So, went to a midnight screening, and I have to tell you, watching The Dark Knight I did not know what to expect because\nof all the hype. Well, I do not know what expectations people had, but for me, it exceeded what I wanted it to do, and\nmore!To call this a superhero film only is a bit of an understatement, actually, it is a lot. It plays out like a crime\nfilm. More than i thought it would too. Without knowing it was rated PG-13, I wouldnt know it was. It has the tone and\nfeel of a Rated R film, films like The Departed, No country for Old Men, and Seven. After watching Batman Begins about a\nyear ago, it really is different. The Dark Knight doesnt feel like the first, nor does it feel like any other superhero\nfilm ever made. I will say this, though, do not worry about expectations when you watch it. You really do not have time\nto be thinking about it, and if you are, it means the film is not keeping your interest. Well, watching The Dark knight\nwas probably the most thrilling, enjoyable, and amazing experience I have ever had in a theater. The fans all in line,\nand also when the film started, all throughout, we were all blown away. There were claps and cheers, there were\nwhistling( a bit annoying) but it was all root for the film. The film entertained, not just with some of the best action\nsequences ever, but with its amazing script. It is very powerful, more powerful than some of the Oscar films last year.\nI think the Academy should take this amazing script into consideration. The acting by everyone was top-notch. But of\ncourse, the one that steals the show is Heath Ledger. Does Ledger deserve all the Oscar buzz? All the hype? With a very\nun-fanboyish answer, freakin yes!!! Heath Ledger accomplished something amazing. I cannot really compare his acting,\ncharacter he created, with any I have ever seen(unlike many critics). Yes, he has a bit of Hannibal Lector, but with all\nrespect, what he did in this film is beyond what Anthony Hopkins accomplished in The Silence of the Lambs. He goes\nreally deep into the character, so deep that in ever scene he is in, you cannot help but imagine what the actor was\nthinking, how he was reacting, to all his lines and scenes. I think Ledger, even if he was alive, would have received\nthis buzz. Surprisingly, it was not over-the-top like I thought it would be. He doesnt overreact, he just is. The\naction in this film, unlike the first one, is literally amazing! It is very much stunts, and the reason the action works\nis because of how the script builds it up.Overall, I cannot say if this film will exceed all expectations. Many fans\nhave a lot of anticipation, and expect a full-blown masterpiece. I have seen amazing, great, even perfect films, but\nonly a few can be called masterpieces. Is this a masterpiece? Well, not really, at least not by everyone. Some will say\nit missed that mark, some will say it is... The thing with this film is that its trying to be an amazing, flawless deep\nsuperhero film. It is very ambitious(yes, overused word, but its the truth) and it aims for that goal, and in a lot of\nstages, like writing, direction, entertainment, complexity, darkness, it is somewhere a hidden masterpiece. It is not\nthe second-coming like fanboys call it, but it is near one in a way. Never has a blockbuster achieved so many things at\nonce, and never has it reached this lever of deepness(that Batman Begins TRIED to reach) and in that way, yes, maybe it\nis a masterpiece, only time will tell though. But, even though it is not flawless, it really is an amazing film, by any\nmeans, and not just the best superhero film ever made by far, but also the most thought-provoking film in years that I\nhave seen, and will stand among some of the best epic, big blockbusters of all time. It certainly deserves too. Now,\non to the Oscars, The Academy should not snub this film in a lot of categories.... Best Director for Christopher Nolan\nis deserved...",

She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is\nbig step, thinking about previous \"Thor\" movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just cant count. Valkyrie fits\nperfectly in the \"Revengers\" team, such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on\nscreen is awesome.The movie its so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The\nscore of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three \"Thor\"\nmovies. Firstly. because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly its also one of the best MCU movies.Phase\n3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard Marvel fan, I appreciate that.I will\nnot reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but youll not be disappointed\nat all! Hela is epic, Odin got his significant role and there are some Huge connections thatll lead to \"Infinity War\"\nand youll lose your mind when you see them.MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!",

Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Hela and Fenrir as Lokis children??Loki is\nalready a well established and grounded character.At this point,I dont think any director/writer could change Lokis\npast and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Lokis kids cause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.For\nthe sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the Norse Myth and in the comics.The performances of the main\ncast are impressive and exceptional.This movie also showed us the real \"God of Thunder\".For the first time he was\nextremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming all over his body was pure awesomeness.This movie is\nmostly targeted for everybody except for joyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have a boring,dull\nlife. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda remind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of\nthis,some critics were praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this movies soundtrack list is on\nthe same level with GotG 1 which was perfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all\nbig,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So glad they finally made him talk.They really\nimproved his CGI.The best version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her\nperformance.I still hear some people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesnt look like Valkyrie in\nmyth.Well,she doesnt have to actually.All I care about is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major\nhit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track\nrecord since 2008.Unlike some peoples petty,shallow claims,I dont think marvel is always using the same formula again\nand again since 2008.Cause if they fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldnt watch their movies for the past 9\nyears.And they definitely couldnt create the highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players like\nFantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.",

    "reviewBody": "\"Fun\" isnt a dirty word. Its also not a word that means \"not art\" or \"lacking drama.\" And the word \"funny\" likewise\ndoesnt negate artistic integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great filmmaking or \"true art\"\nsimply doesnt know what theyre talking about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor, comedy, and\nsatire not only have a long and glorious history in art and expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly.\nWriting comedy and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than straightforward drama in many ways.\nAnd to whatever extent fun and comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add levity to\nsituations, thats not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I\neven need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the\nnature of rabid, narrow personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing corporation over another. Fandom\nis always -- generally speaking -- turning everything into \"us versus them,\" but the extent to which its devolved into\noutrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or isnt \"art,\" is a newer development and a sign of the\nshallowness of so much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre storytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and\nits also funny. It is also dramatic, it is also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and it\nis one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up",

    "reviewBody": "Starting from the basics.What does the title mean?From Wikipedia: In Norse mythology, Ragnark is a series of future\nevents, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the\ngods Odin, Thor, Tr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent\nsubmersion of the world in water. the fact that our film and characters are quite literally the same as those mentioned\nin the Norse mythology one would hope to see such cataclysmic disasters of monumental proportions on screen from \"The\nHouse of idea\" right? WRONG!! Well our characters have either gone fully insane or the performers were bound by\ncontracts and buried under the pile of of cash that they didnt tried to borrow or adapt anything remotely from the\nsource and that spelled Ragnarok (ironic in this case) for the film. The performances are trite and pathetic except for\nHemsworth who showcases his natural talent of comic relief. He has proved time and again that he has the talent for what\nit takes to be a powerhouse and his boastful resume speaks of Rush,Thor, In the Heart of Sea, etc. But sadly the \"GOD of\nThunder\" has been reduced to a self aware parody that only leads to ennui for the audience.This feels more like what the\n\"GOD of blunder\" would do.Mind you, this film is mostly targeted for children and teenage audience so humor, colorful\nC.G.I scenery which are glaringly obvious and plainly distracting in some cases in the film and retro infused\nsoundtracks are enough on the platter to cater to them. Hulks character is forced in the film as he doesnt feel\nnatural midst all the chaos. Even his motion capture looks cheap as low budget corny effects.his struggling with his\nhumanity and monstrosity sides has been sidelined and likely wont be addressed further as his presence in ANY film is\njust to have a bruiser to smash.Tessa Thompsons Valkyrie looks NOTHING like her comic counterpart since she should have\nbeen a tall musclebound warrior with sinewy physique not some glamour model walking the catwalk cos-playing her new\nWalmart sale. ODIN the all-father, one of the most powerful characters is conveniently sidestepped so as to circumvent\nhis true potential like taking head on with Galactus the \"Devourer of Worlds\", taking a full on brunt from Silver surfer\nand Thanos and acting like nothing ever happened. But sadly Anthony Hopkins looks tired and bored to continue and even\nexpressed disappointment regarding this very fact not once but twice!!Then why bother casting him in the first\nplace??All in all a \"seen it all before\" repeating formulaic garbage from MCU. i dont understand how the director said\nin the first place this will be darker than all previous THOR movies. did i mention Karl urban was in it? Yes he was as\nforgettable as his character was that of a mindless grunt henchmen of Hela. No personality or development just boom boom\npow.",

Tone wise movie is far too light for what Ragnarok stands\nfor. And you never really worry for any of the main cast, at least I did not. The feeling was similar to watching a\ncartoon - colors, action, dialogues not too heavy on the words, moments of build up and joy, moments of emptiness. Movie\nearns a 7/10 and a solid one. Now for the rant: Can IMDb stop letting accounts with less than 1 week after registration\nperiod post reviews? First review Ive read, prior to writing my own, was a Bulgarian guy giving movie a 10/10 (movie\nhas flaws). Guy has no other ratings, review or anything. Accounts is 2 days old. So I decided to check other 10/10\nreviews - all fresh accounts, made on the day of the premier or just now. Isnt this suspicious? The ratings can also go\nboth ways. Just I dont want any of fake publicity shadow other peoples opinions, including my own. I am more than sure\nno one watched this movie and said to himself/herself \"Hey, I must go on IMDb, make an account and review this!\". This\nis not that kind of movie, you will get same emotions as youve received from the trailer, to put it short. Nothing\nspecial :D",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game",
    "reviewBody": "Really enjoyed the first Thor and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up Thor: The Dark World.\nThor: Ragnarok manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel\nCinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the Guardians of the Galaxy films) but also one of their best to\ndate.As said in my review for The Death of Stalin, 2017 has been very hit and miss for films, the best ones being\nwonderful (I.e. Gods Own Country, The Farthest, The Death of Stalin, Blade Runner 2049, Wind River, IT,\nThe LEGO Batman Movie) and the worst ones being dreadful (i.e. Baywatch, The Snowman, The Emoji Movie,\nStratton, Flatliners, The Mummy, Transformers: The Last Knight). Thor: Ragnarok is to me up there with the\nyears best. Would even go as far to say that its one of the best and most entertaining \"superhero\" films so far,\nwhether in Marvel, DCU or anywhere.On a visual level, Thor: Ragnarok is the best-looking of the three Thor films and\nof Marvel in general. Asgard looks colourful and atmospheric. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations\nare stunningly vivid. The special effects and stunts are not just dazzling and have substance and purpose rather than\njust being thrown in for the sake of it, they are among the best of any Marvel film. Just for the record, Marvel get a\nlot of hate, particularly in the ridiculous and blown completely out of proportion DCU vs Marvel war, have personally\nenjoyed a lot many of their efforts. The music pulsates thrillingly and is also catchy and rich in atmosphere and\nemotion.Thor: Ragnarok, as said, is a contender for Marvels funniest film. The dialogue crackles in wit and deadpan\ndeliciousness, and absolutely loved Thors quips and the clever in-jokes (Lokis horrified reaction at coming face to\nface with Hulk was a standout). They are all placed adeptly, placement is never questionable.Its not just about the\nhumour that makes Thor: Ragnarok so great though. Like Thor: The Dark World in particular of the previous two films,\nthe action is absolutely thrilling and breath-taking in spectacle (almost The Lord of the Rings-like in scale). There\nis plenty of bold dark-natured tension and the emotional moments give the film a lot of heart and are genuinely\nmoving.Taika Waititi balances humour, action and drama with ease and it shows in the compelling and tightly structured\nand paced story. The characters are even more expansive in development, both intrigue and entertain and their well\nfleshed out personalities make them easy to care for them. Thor and Loki are beautifully realised characters while Hulk\nis the most interesting hes been in a long time. Hela is not just the best non-Loki Thor villain (so much better than\nthe one-dimensional and underwritten villain of The Dark World) but also one of the best villains in the Marvel canon,\nnot just posing a threat, interesting in personality and having a motivation that nobody will scoff at but she is also\none of few Marvel villains to actually have an arc. Korg (with Waititi writing himself in to portray) is a bit random\nbut is a lot of fun.Chris Hemsworth is at his most relaxed and charismatic, while Tom Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and\npitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. Anthony Hopkins continues to bring welcome\ngravitas to Odin and doesnt ham up. Cate Blanchett relishes the character of Hela, and makes her a character thats\nmenacing, entertaining and oddly rootable.Mark Ruffalo is a strong presence as Hulk, Benedict Cumberbatch brings\neverything that was good about his Dr Strange in the first place and Jeff Goldblum is suitably playful. Karl Urban comes\noff least but does his best with the relatively little he has (which to me was nowhere near distracting enough to bring\nthe film down).Overall, a brilliant film with Thor and Marvel being at the top of their game. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

    "reviewBody": "Another win for Marvel. Phase three shows no signs of slowing down. The movies itself is a great stand alone film, but\nalso does its part for the wider MCU. Thor has evolved from the serious, god-like character we knew after spending some\nyears on Earth. His new found humor fits well without throwing away the development that has occurs in previous\nappearances. The dynamic between Thor and Loki continues to flourish; the latter remains a key factor into the franchise\nsuccess. Hulk/Banner gets enough screen time to warrant a spot in the title. No one will ever tire of seeing Hulk smash\non a scale as large as this. Stand out performance from Valkyrie. Excellent portrayal of a lesser-known character that\nshall no longer be lesser-known. Grandmaster goes full Goldblum. That should be enough to sell you on that character.\nHela does not fit the mold of weak antagonist roles from past Marvel movies. Too powerful to disregard with motives to\nback her actions. Epic actions scenes on a larger than life scale. Worth a watch in IMAX. Some overuse of comedy but\nits what you come to expect from a blockbuster appealing to the masses. Not once does it distract you from the threat\nat hand. A nice set up for Infinity War without seeming like a prequel. 9/10.",

This daftness\ncomes from none other than New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi, who over the last few years has created some of the\nmost bizarre adventures ever told in cinema with his hilarious vampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows and\nsecondly Hunt For The Wilderpeople which had a stunning performance from Sam Neill in a hat made from a collinder.\nHowever Thor: Ragnarok is his most ridiculous adventure yet.After Chris Hemsworths Thor is hurled from the bifrost hes\ncaptured on a strange planet which from first glance is obviously the universes trash can, under the rule of Jeff\nGoldblums daft, yet tyrannical Grandmaster who looks like he just wears anything he finds in the 80s factory complete\nwith a blue line under his lip and comes with a lot of Goldbluminess, hes funny as hell - he gives Thor the ultimate\nfight against his champion - Hulks (Mark Ruffalo) welcome is really no surprise but comes with a roundhouse of applause\nparticularly with the well-drawn hand-to-hand combat in a Star Wars-esque gladiatorial coliseum which cant escape\nThors scream of joy and a few quick-witted jokes to get you going. Meanwhile on the other side of the universe the\nAsghardians are held for a fight for their survival after a vicious attack from Cate Blanchetts goddess of death Hela\nlooking a tad like Alice Coopers twisted sister complete with a horned helmet for ferocity. Sadly her performance is\nthe films weakest point, she doesnt exactly come with Galadriels strength or depth shes not Marvels best villain,\nthough a better improvement over Thor: The Dark Worlds Dark Elves. Shes not in many scenes and when she does appear\nher delivery is often heavy-handed and empty with little feeling.The script penned by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and\nChristopher Yost is an improvement over the previous instalment too - the funnier scenes are along the same lines as\nJames Gunns unadulterated joy for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, here there are arse gags and penis gags aplenty\nwhich is a vast improvement over the previous two films barrier for serious face the actors are allowed to let loose\nhere. Particularly the shared chemistry between Thor who hates having his hair cut, Hulk angry as ever and Tessa\nThompsons surly Valkyrie who cant stop drinking yet comes with a humanizing story giving her performance some emotion.\nYet theres humour to them too they each share their time with the whims and the jokes that the script has to offer, the\nthree arguing in a room with an angry Hulk and a teamed final fight are obvious standouts. Sadly, Thor: Ragnarok doesnt\ncome without its flaws its not utterly thunderous throughout the last few minutes of the final fight are a little CG\nheavy theres a lot going on in a few shots it can be difficult to follow a certain point which watching in 3D can be on\noccasion daunting to the eyes. Though there is some goodness the CG images on show, here the destruction of Asghard\nthough upsetting for the fans who have stayed with the series is thoroughly stunning plus this is the most impressive\nvision of Hulk yet, hes still a wonder to watch from the outrageous gladiatorial combat, through the hilarious jokes he\nlets free to the films final fight hes relentless and utterly charming. This is vintage Waititi he is clearly at home\nhere in the huge immersive worlds of space or the cramped space of Hulks chamber he allows you to breathe with the\nworld he has created here. The finale of the Thor series is one of the most intense, boldest adventures Marvel has ever\ncreated does it bring on the thunder? Youre damn right it does.VERDICT Daft, ridiculous and hilarious Waititi manages\nto retain his unique brand of humour and goofball madness in this neon-infused 80s style finale.",

Unlike be other Thor movies which were pretty poor, this one is\nabsolutely fantastic! I cannot praise this movie enough! I was in stitches for most of the film, as was the rest of the\ncinema audience. The character Korg is a sensationally funny character and one to look out for; those one liners are\namazing. Truly a great movie with excellent content, and overshadows both previous movies. Id you dont see this movie,\nyou will really be missing out! Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much content the Hulk had. He wasnt just a\nside character for this movie which I expected",

    "reviewBody": "The film is well made, good CGI, and it is very entertaining....lots of action and humour. However, the plot is very\nbasic, it is very predictable, and lacks tension and emotional engagement (probably due to the almost constant humorous\ndialogue and gags). My biggest concern is that the humour has gone too far, to the extent that the characters bear very\nlittle resemblance to previous films. If youre just after a entertaining film, with good humour and action, this should\nwork for you. If you want the Marvel world that youve seen in previous films, with Thor and Hulk in character, then\nthis isnt it. A formula thats working with Guardians and Deadpool, doesnt have to be imposed in characters in this\nfranchise, there was enough humour in the previous films, but this goes too far in my opinion, as I was hoping to see\nthe same characters as in the previous films.",

    "reviewBody": "I dont get all the 10 star reviews, did these people ever read the comics and know the characters? As it does not add\nup if they did! Actors were good, so good casting, but the story is awful, its a mish-mash of at least five different\ngood stories from people who knew how to write good comics back in the day. The characters, are not as they should be\nfor some reason, I guess the Hollywood writers had a basic bio of the characters, and then just wrote whatever pleased\nthem without doing any research. The comedy is throughout, why is there so much I dont know, if I want comedy, Ill\nwatch the carry on films. Really gutted, Marvel Studios obviously and unfortunately cant do serious anymore, it almost\nfeels like a mockery. Dont waste your time with the end credit scene, totally a waste of time. Give me Watchmen any day\nof the week over this, although Ill confess it was an improvement on the last Thor film. Please Marvel Studios, get a\nproper writing team and give up on this average cramped up stories youre giving us!A wise man once said, Nuff Said!",

    "reviewTitle": "incoherent mess that doesnt understand what Ragnarok means",
    "reviewBody": "Likes : Im sorry if youre looking for the bandwagon ten star review here youre better off look at a marvel fanboy\nreview, because here youre getting an honest and straight to the point review on this film.Now im not gonna complete\ntrash this film as there were moment in this film that were funny but sadly not many moment, the action scene\nincluding the the fight between \"Thor\" and the \"Hulk\" were good in areas but had one major flaw with this scene which i\nwill explain in dislikes.The main character that stood out more was Cate Blanchett playing Hela (the goddess of death),\nmy god did she play this with perfection as she carves her way through Asgard solider with easy she is a force to be\nreckon with. Cate clearly was perfect casting for this role with a very sexy look in a dark way and very charismatic\nvillain in having one purpose to destroy and control.Tessa Thompson didnt do a bad job with her role as a \"Valkyrie\"\nwhich we go a slight back story of why she no longer with Asgard, she does add a little bit humor to the film, with Karl\nUrban character not sure where the writer of this film were going with this character but seem a bit of a waste as he\nwasnt really doing much though the film. Benedict Cumberbatch playing Dr strange in the film as a cameo like iron man\nbut shorter scene was a little funny in places but a little over the top, Jeff Goldblum playing the grand master one of\nthe ageless Elders of the Universe and has mastered most civilizations games of skill and chance, did OK with this role\nyou could see he had fun with this role.Mark Ruffalo Hulk is a little different in this film as the look and manor of\nthe character has changes but still the same hulk, there a few jokes though around about the other avengers, Chris\nHemsworth put in a OK performance and did offer some funny moments though the film as well as the bad ass look with the\nlighting around him which gave the character a better flare.Although this film is entertaining in areas and some of the\nvisual effect were good, sadly this film was full of flaws that makes it a mess.Dislikes : The visual effect in this\nfilm throughout most scene felt like an amateur had done it on a cheap PC, even from the scene which is in the trailer\nwhen Hela smashed the hammer was bad. This scene of where they are before this event happens look seriously bad,\nspecially when they are looking out at the sea you could see that this scene is in front of them is a Green screen. This\njust made the scene so fake it almost takes you out of the moment they are trying to portray and clearly from the\ntrailer the alleyway scene was so much better, its looked like they swap the ally-way scene for a cheap look visual\neffect cliff-side which they should of kept with the ally-way it would have looked better.The concept alone was a\ncomplete mess even for a marvel film, i know a lot of fans will say he just a Dc fanboy marvel hater but im not saying\nthis for the sake of trashing this film it really is that bad from a critic stand point.The film doesnt know what it\ntrying to be iver a comedy or serious it just come off so bad it pull the film even some of the joke and humor fall flat\nwhich is bad for comedy, some of them feel completely forced at time to make it funny. Sadly the only funny part in the\nwhole film was Thor with a bowling ball, that one scene was the only time i hear the audience laugh because that was\nfunny.It like the Director or writers have forgotten what Ragnarok actually means and theyve try to make a comedic\nfilm with a serious tone (sorry but this just doesnt work in a film), specially a film with Cate Blanchett character\nwhos very tone is very dark, this shouldve been a lot more serious, darker and the humor less maybe this wouldve work\nfor the story alone. Instead we get this incoherent mess with music that doesnt even fit the film what so ever with bad\njokes and over use of the word like a child would do using the word Ass several times, sorry but Thor 3 Ragnarok is by\nfar the 2nd worst movie marvel has done even though it was entertaining. P.S There two end credit scenes but the very\nend credit scene wasnt even worth staying behind to see after the credit rolled, it was a waste of time even adding it\nas it was nothing to do with Infinity war.",

    "reviewBody": "Ultimately, its like most of the Marvel movies; slick but shallow, doesnt take it self seriously, and full of\nobligatory CGI fight scenes with no real impact. Ragnarok basically throws in all the great stuff from the Thor comics\nthat havent been used yet, pays lip service to them, and then makes a mockery of the whole thing. Hulk fighting Thor?\nHas no impact because its all so comedic. Its just empty spectacle. The whole movie is like that.So much here is\nwasted. Heimdall (Idris Elba looks like he didnt even want to be there). Cate Blanchett. Odin. Skurge. The Fenris Wolf.\nSurtur. Planet Hulk. The whole Ragnarok myth is reduced to not very much. All sacrificed at the alter of constant, silly\ngags.If you want some dumb, silly, spectacular entertainment, its passable, but Thor: Ragnarok is a terrible waste of\npotential and great source material.",

    "reviewBody": "I have to admit this blew me away , I wasnt expecting to enjoy it but this was a really funny enjoyable piece of\nentertainment. Definitely worth seeing . This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films like the LOTR\ntrilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians of the Galaxy . Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As\nwell as the Stone revolutionary South African gladiator . Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role\nfor Scarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble . As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about\nthe franchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk ) mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by\nan excellent script and great comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Banner and\nValkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performance was below par for such an excellent actor . Plenty of\naction and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .Its a film Id definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the\nreclining seats :) Pad.A 9/10",

The concept is one of the best you can see in superhero movies.They\nbalanced the humor and seriousness perfectly.There were also brutal moments which will surprise you.Especially the 3rd\nact is pretty brutal.I heard the laughter of audience almost on every funny moment of the movie. I never thought a Thor\nmovie would have an awesome soundtrack.I can tell that it really gives you the Guardians of the Galaxy 1 vibes. So in\ngeneral,the movie is one of its kind in this genre and very unique.",

I also liked the female characters in\nthis one, both very bad ass fighters, no unnecessary romantic entanglement as the previous works. (I mean, its not\nabout Jane herself, shes fine, but was written in a way that doesnt really fit in or helpful to the plot.)btw I\nwatched it in BFI IMAX. It was such an experience!

    "reviewTitle": "Now THATS how you make a Thor film!!",
    "reviewBody": "Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were among the weaker installments. They took them a little\ntoo seriously and they were a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction\nthough. The humour throughout is pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of the motion picture.\nThe lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friends is a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than being\nbogged down with Thors forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from the previous two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the\nforefront as Hela, the villain of the piece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time of her life\nportraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki must put aside their differences and try to stop her.\nHemsworth and Hiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes their dynamic more enjoyable.They end up\ngetting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playing the Grandmaster (but really its Goldblum playing himself)\nwho forces Thor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gains the trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson)\nand from there, its your classic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director,\nadding a lot of charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic is also great as well, a real 80s neon\nfeel. And the music...the music was brilliant! Who wouldve thought that the composer for Rugrats would deliver such an\nawesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form for the God of Thunder!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Joyous escapism",
    "reviewBody": "In this Taika Waititi (Boy, What we do in the Shadows) directed film, written by Eric Pearson (Marvel One Shot: A Funny\nThing Happened on the Way to Thors Hammer, Marvel One Shot: The Consultant), Craig Kyle (Ultimate Avengers, Hulk Vs.),\nChristopher Yost (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars: Rebels), based on comics by Stan Lee (Iron Man, Thor), Larry\nLieber (Iron Man, Thor) and Jack Kirby (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron) and starring Chris\nHemsworth (Rush, Ghostbusters) as Thor.After taking the crown from Surtur (Clancy Brown: The Shawshank Redemption, TVs\nDaredevil), he returns it to his homeland where Thor finds that his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston: Thor, TVs The\nNight Manager) has taken over Asgard and hidden Odin (Anthony Hopkins: Silence of the Lambs, Thor) on Earth, but upon\nhis death, Hela (Cate Blanchett: The Lord of the Rings, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) God of Death and their\npowerful sister, comes to take the throne for herself. Thrown across the Universe, Thor is first captured by Valkyrie\n(Tessa Thompson: Selma, TVs Westworld), sold to Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum: Jurassic Park, Independence Day) and held\ncaptive on the planet Sakaar where he and other warriors, including Korg (an inspired turn by director Taiki Waititi),\nare forced to fight for his entertainment. Ultimately Thor is pitted against The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo: Avengers\nAssemble, Now You See Me), but without his hammer, can Thor not only win his gladiatorial duel against his former\nAvenger friend but also convince and assemble a team (Hulk, Valkyrie and his untrustworthy brother) to stop Hela and\nprevent Ragnarok, the doom of the Asgarian civilisation? This action, adventure, comedy film hit all the right notes for\nme. The humour was spot on, right up my street (think Deadpool), and this and the action never felt forced. All the\nactors were on their A game and for me, a huge Loki fan, I have to admit that in his own small way, Korg stole the movie\nlike Loki did in Thor. Not even the turn from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,\nTVs Sherlock) could beat it.I was pleased that Hela, the main villain, got her character arc as this has been lacking in\nsome previous Marvel films and has for me left the baddies flat, and this time the epic fight scenes bookend the serious\nmoments well. As perturbing as it was for a fan of the mythology for Hela and Fenrir to be used not as Lokis children,\nit worked for the film and Goldblums wackiness gelled as well as Samuel L Jacksons bad guy Valentine in Kingsman. Yes\nit is awful when they summarily kill off some favourite characters, in some cases notably without even giving them a\nline, and concentrate more on Skurge (Karl Urban: Star Trek, The Bourne Supremacy) but here too they give him a\nmeaningful character arc, he wants to be worthy and he gets his chance. Heimdall (Idris Elba: Prometheus, Pacific Rim)\nis busy trying to hide and save as many innocent Asgardians as he can while Hela searches for the sword that will help\nher start the apocalypse for other worlds. And though Banner worries that allowing himself to turn back into the Hulk\nmay leave him that way forever, he too gets his emotional scenes when we see the cameo of Black Widow (Scarlet\nJohansson: We Bought a Zoo, Lucy) and his chance to shine against the terrifying Fenrir.The soundtrack is epic in its\nown right, up there with GOTG1, and the film does not feel like more of the same (as some of the superhero movies have\nsadly started feeling), it feels back to its best. If this is to be the last Thor movie, then they gave him a great one\nto bow out.Yes the movie had a few flaws (e.g. Thor has never wanted the power of ruling, Banner may stay as the Hulk),\nbut as the best way to describe the film is pure fun, I am going to give it 10/10 despite these because that is just\nwhat most people need at the moment, joyous escapism.",

It beats GoTG for sure.Okay, the\ncharacters. FFS, Hela is OP. Thor didnt have any chance against her. She is unstoppable and cannot f-word die. She is\ngoddess of death, after all. Maybe I can put her in the third position of strongest villain on MCU below big-purple man\nand Surtur. I didnt list Dormammu because we have not see his true strength.So, conclusion. Nearly cry tears for joy by\nseeing the original power of Thor, Valkyrie is awesome, Loki is still God of Mischief, Heimdall didnt have Soul Stone\nneither nor Hela, there is a character who totally change in Infinity War later, and we get a tiny glimpse on how Thor\nget stranded in Star Lords ship in first post end credit scene.Its a 8.0 of 10",

Its lightning fast, there arent any dull moments at all, but its\nmissing a little gravitas. The Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what hes always been.\nTheres hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It works though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting\ncharacters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always. Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The\nvillains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela,\nthough I love the way Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. Theres hardly any background or reason to\nsome of her actions. And Surtur well, hes just a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: Its good. It really is.\nYoull laugh, but youll miss a little seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like most Marvel movies, the\nvillains dont marvel.",

Please Marvel, put your jokes at the right place. For some entity\nlike humans, lets said Spider-Man, Dead-Pool, its okay for a full movies with jokes, its natural, because theyre\nhuman, they are average. But this? You just ruined all the Thors character you build for many years. I was hoping for a\ncool CGI with cool story and cool fight, cause its about Asgard, not a New Yorker boy who meet crazy rich genius. Once\nagain, please, put your jokes with right portion and right place. You definitely fail on this. Too cheesy. This was my\nbiggest disappointment as Marvel fans for as long as I can remember. You killed his attitude, you definitely killed\nThor. You killed my fantasies since I was a child. Im okay if you put all your very cheesy shallow jokes to those human\ncharacters. But this? Guardians of 9 realms? Like what? Like What are you guys thinking? Its just like you want to tell\nus that all of our lives is just a jokes like what they did?You totally cool for makes me out of this world with Ego\nJokes at Guardians Of Galaxy, it hits me so hard like were just nothing. But once again? Like really? Is that all of\nyou want to tell us? Is that the hidden message? Well played dude.You put a comedy on a wrong place. And I was like\ndefinitely can know each and every step of your cheesy shallow jokes. Every single thing. It was not entertaining\nanymore. Too much and not a smart move, I never thought marvel would be as shallow as this. So shallow. Way more Shallow\nthan The 40 Year Old Virgin or American Pie.You guys makes me bored. And if you keeping something like this for infinite\nwars, Please, just turn all of your smart cool brain into comedy shows. Makes a new production house, you definitely\ngood at it. But please, Dont put any single superhero on it. I begging you.You missed to build all the mood of this\nstory, even the super prankster Deadpool still have its touchy feelings. For this? Zero. Minus.I put the ratings only\nfor CGI, which doesnt amaze me since Ive seen something like that at the guardians of galaxy. I expected more.And\nyeah, why You Chris Hemsworth? Why you killed your own figure? Youre not like Tom Hiddlestone who still can manage his\nown figure, Loki, hes still have characters. Even thou its turn into comedy movie, hes keeping his own pride\ncharacters. And yeah Benedict, he played so well to keep the Dr Strange as a character, even its (again and again) a\ncomedy movie. But he still have its character as a keeper. Stronger beings. And so for Mark Ruffalo, who keep the hulk\ncharacter. Its cool how he keep confused become a human again. Theyre well played. But you Chris? You makes me so\ndisappointed... is that really how a God Characters looks like? No charisma at all? More weak and not smarter than a\nhuman? Oh please.. or this is your hidden agenda? Its beyond dude~~~Welcome To Stan Lee Comedy Show with big budget and\ncool CGI only to trolling you and makes a die hard fans got away from you. You can keep all those cheesy shallow fans to\nget along you with this Deadpool Pattern With Guardians Of Galaxy CGI thingy. But not me. Surprised me next time, OK?",

    "reviewBody": "Beautiful cinematic scenes with colorful beats making this one of Marvels best movie yet. Its whimsical tone and easy to\nfollow story pace makes it a film perfect for anyone who wants a light superhero movie.For me personally, i find this\nmovie... cringed. Thor major 180 flip personality, Loki tone down power hungry manipulative personality, the some what\nshort serious tone in between, the unnecessary Dr. Strange scene, the death of friends. Welp it seems that Jane dumping\nThor makes his movie lighter and funnier. Overall its still one of the best movie to watch with family and or friends.\nThe super light and fun characters is truly a blessing. It feels more like a stand-alone movie rather than a part of a\nseries. Its just that fun! You dont need to watch the 1st and 2nd Thor movie, this movie will make you fall in love\nwith Thor (more like Thor 2.0 Taika style).",

    "reviewBody": "1) Its cheesy - This movie is filled with cheesy dialog and jokes. A bit more than other Marvel movies like Iron Man 1\nor the Avengers. To me, it felt a bit too much. The movie could have been fine without the comic relief character.2) Bad\nCGI - not all CGI was terrible, but if you paid attention to the background images it would become really obvious that\nthe lighting isnt natural and the sense of depth is missing.3) Characters feel immortal - Its kind of ridiculous that\nThor can survive immense attacks by blunt weapons and being smacked into a wall easily. As a viewer, I dont know what\nit takes for Thor to be in danger.4) Coincidences - Everything that happens to the characters are extremely convenient\nfor the story to continue. The amount of times characters stumble into each other by chance is unrealistic.5) Dumb\nClichs - Theres a bunch. Cant say without giving away spoilers though. If youre watching it, expect good action\nsequences and everything else from solo Marvel movies.",

    "reviewTitle": "Guaranteeing a \"safe passage through the anus\"",
    "reviewBody": "Im neither a Marvel fan, nor (in particular) a Thor fan.. but I have to admit \"Thor: Ragnarok\" was brilliant from\nbeginning to end. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been travelling the universe in search of stuff (I neither remember nor\ncare) but returns to his home planet of Asgard with a dire warning of impending Raganrok: this being the End of Days\nfor Asgard. But he finds the court engaged in serious leisure time!Things go from bad to worse when Hela (Cate\nBlanchett, \"Carol\") \" someone with more than a passing relationship to Thor \" arrives with a mission to assume the\nthrone. Teamed uncomfortably with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, \"High Rise\"), the brothers get cast millions of\nlight years away to a planet lorded over by a grand master (a lovely performance, that I will leave anonymous here)\nwho pits new gladiators in an arena against his latest champion. Youll never guess who his champion is? Well, OK (cos\nthe trailer gives it away) hes big and green! The films script is hilarious. It generates an enormous volume of\nentertainment with laugh-out loud moments throughout; the unforeseen involvement of other Marvel characters; some\nstartling cameos all mixed with the usual brand of spectacular fights and action. Some of the action is surprising: a\nreal eye-opener you might say.The lead cast (Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett and Ruffalo) all perform admirably and are\njoined by heavyweight cameos from Anthony Hopkins (\"Westworld\") and Idris Elba (\"Bastille Day\") reprising their roles\nfrom \"Thor: The Dark World\". Particularly impressive is Tessa Thompson (\"Creed\") as Thors Valkyrie warrior side-kick\nand Karl Urban (\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\") as the turn-coat Asgardian Skurge.Directed by young New Zealander Taika\nWaititi (behind last years successful indie hit \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\") its a breath of fresh air for the Thor\nfranchise, more similar to the style of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" rather than the previous films in the series. Waititi\nalso saves all the best comedy lines for himself as the rock warrior character Korg: his New Zealand twang delivering\njust side- splitting dialogue. As with most Marvel films, its a little bit flabby in places, running to 130 minutes:\nsome of the dialogue, particularly scenes between Hemsworth and Ruffalo, feel like they needed tightening up in the\nediting suite. This time of course includes the scrolling of endless teams of visual effect artists in the closing\ntitles which \" naturally \" 90% of the audience stay for to see if there are any \"monkeys\". In fact,there are two: one\nfairly early on; the other right at the end. (To be honest, I thought neither of them was particularly worth waiting\nfor). However overall the movie is highly recommended for a fun night out at the cinema. By the way, this is a film best\nviewed cold if someone tries to tell you the surprises, cut them off quick!(Thor (sic) the full graphical review, please\nvisit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks!).",

    "reviewTitle": "Get ready to Ragnarok  Roll - this film is the most fun youll have in a cinema all year!",
    "reviewBody": "In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of\nliteral doom and gloom, its an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that\npretty much describes the world in which we currently live, its actually rather fitting that Marvels 17th studio film\nis something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a\nraucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes. Thank Thor\n(and director Taika Waititi) for that!We reunite with Thor (Hemsworth) - still free of new Infinity Stones, freshly\nconfident that hes once again warded off the fabled Ragnarok - just as he discovers that something is rotten in the\nstate of Asgard. As teased at the end of Thor: The Dark World, Loki (Hiddleston), his shape-shifting trickster brother,\nhas been impersonating their ailing dad, Odin (Hopkins). When Odins strength finally fails, the dark secret hes been\nkeeping at bay storms into the lives of his sons: Hela (Blanchett), their bloodthirsty older sister, is back to claim\nthe throne she believes is rightfully hers.For (largely) better or (occasionally) worse, Thor: Ragnarok doesnt dwell as\nmuch on the royal family drama as its predecessors did. Instead, its second act plays out on the candy-coated,\ndeath-dealing planet of Sakaar. Ruled by the whims and fancies of the Grandmaster (Goldblum dialled to 11), Sakaars\npeople are relentlessly entertained in their very own battle dome. (Think the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome,\nwith holographic screens and super-powered alien beings.) Following an initial devastating confrontation with Hela, Thor\nis stranded on Sakaar, and brought in by the mercenary Valkyrie (Thompson) to stand against the raging primal force of\nthe Hulk (Ruffalo) - not quite the \"friend from work\" Thor remembers. If that all sounds like serious business, rest\nassured its very much not. Theres a gentle wit threaded through every frame of this film - a glorious, big-hearted\nsilliness that fans of Taika Waititi will remember (and treasure) from such indie comedy gems as What We Did In The\nShadows and Hunt For The Wilderpeople. Miraculously, Waititi has managed to infuse this gargantuan, green-screened epic\nwith his trademark offbeat vibe, best exemplified in the way key plot points are revealed (via sardonic monologue or\nironic stage play) and the character he plays (Korg, a chirpy rock monster who befriends Thor before our hero heads into\nthe arena). Waititis involvement is a blessing for pretty much everyone involved in the film, but especially for\nHemsworth. Its not that he hasnt been good in his previous appearances as the God of Thunder throughout the franchise\n- he was suavely charming in Thor and resolutely grim in The Dark World. But hes so remarkably good here, switching\neffortlessly between bright-eyed puppy and care-worn leader, that it feels like hes finally come home. Hemsworths\nperformance in this film is a fantastic balance of sunshine, silliness and subversiveness, and its a joy to behold.Its\nclear, too, that everyone in the cast - including respected veterans like Hopkins and Blanchett - were delighted to\npartake in the films mirth and mayhem. Ruffalo continues to play the dual aspects of Bruce Banner - looming brute and\nmild-mannered professor - with so much winning charm that you want him to get his own Hulk movie, stat. Hiddleston is\ntotally game for playing up the odd- couple comedy of Lokis rivalry with Thor, while shading unexpected complexity into\nhis characters machinations. Thompson swaggers off with practically every scene shes in, finding the heart, humour and\nheroism in an Asgardian warrior whos lost her way. Perhaps more impressively, Waititi handles every Marvel\nblockbusters requisite action scenes with more clarity and flair than youd expect from an indie director. He manages\nto find character and comedy beats even in swooping spaceship chases and bruising hand-to-hand combat. Theres a\nthrilling fluidity to the action sequences - whether its Thor soaring towards his enemies like lightning made flesh, or\nHela unleashing her multiple projectiles of death with a dark, graceful beauty.Thats not to say Thor: Ragnarok is\nperfect. As it turns out, the films greatest strength - apocalypse as afterthought - is also its biggest flaw. Waititi\njust about manages to find the emotional weight in Thor coming to terms with his power and leadership (a driving theme\nfor this character), but it does get a little lost in all the knockabout comedy. Thanks to Blanchett, Hela is never less\nthan terrifying: she oozes gleeful malevolence in her wake, forcing Thor to confront his own gold-tinted ideas of\nhimself, his family and his history. Alas, shes also one of that peculiar breed of antagonist whos immeasurably\npowerful and strangely ineffective, all at the same time. For years, Marvel has been making brave choices in terms of\nthe directors to whom it has entrusted its stories and characters. This strategy has yielded films that are, for the\nmost part, creatively diverse, ranging in quality from decent to excellent. Even so, handing the reins of the Thor\nfranchise to a director with such a unique voice as Waititi might have been its biggest gamble yet. Fortunately, it pays\noff in spades. Smart, silly and self-aware, Thor: Ragnarok is a blockbuster that feels like it snuck into cinemas by way\nof the art-house. Its also that rare threequel which isnt just as good as its predecessors - its easily the best of\nthe lot.",

    "reviewTitle": "An utter blast",
    "reviewBody": "Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children\nof the MCU, and when theyre two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two\nhavent really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though Im a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on\nboard to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is\npitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to\nAsgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.Its\ntestament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce\nwork as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with\nsuch vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so\nfar.With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny\nit ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and\nHulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. Its the screenplay from Eric\nPearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters were introduced to, Korg\nin particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCUs most welcome additions.The action, of which there is\nplenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaughs score and even Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song, which kicks\nthe finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobes cinematography combines seamlessly with the\nexpectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.Coming to the\nperformances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts\nat one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness\nand naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just cant imagine\nanyone else playing Thor.The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work\nas the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role\nof Loki and hes expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why hes such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer\nTessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as\nValkyrie. If youre a fan of Jeff Goldblum then Id just like to say you wont be disappointed with his performance as\nGrandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of\nthe piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she\nsuited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why cant the villains have\nsome as well?Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs\nand plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait.",

(whether or not\n\"Justice League\" could live up to that title, I guess well never know until November the 17th arrives) Some critics (or\nmaybe just one, I dunno) say that \"Thor Ragnarok\" is the boldest Marvel movie to date, in which I say its true! I mean,\nhow they stir and twist one of the greatest and the most well- known mythology in the world into a super-hilarious comic\nbook movie (that perhaps upsets some people in the Scandinavian countries, from which the epic tales of Thor originated)\nthat people and fans love is the key to Marvel Studios success. I never knew who Taika Waititi was before, but after I\nsaw his movie yesterday, I can confidently say that he is one of the most promising new names in fully-packed-\naction-movie genre in the history of Hollywood.now that I have watched this movie yesterday, Im now looking forward to\nwatching other Marvel Studio movies in the years to come such as Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Guardians of the\nGalaxy vol. 3, Captain Marvel, and the most importantly, Avengers: Infinity War and its sequel.

It is easy to see why they would choose to duplicate the comedic\nstyle.This is my favourite of the three Thor films by a clear margin. I was chuckling quite regularly from the very\nfirst scene. However I did think are they taking the balance of comedy and drama a bit too far at times. Often you feel\nyourself hanging on waiting to see if there is a punchline coming even in the more dramatic moments. Even when the\nbodies are piling up. (The Sokovia Accords have no jurisdiction in the wider universe.) For the most part the directors\napproach of encouraging improvisation does appear to work very well. But sometimes it does feel like there is a real\nlack of the \"straight man\" to add structure to the chain gun of gags.On the whole I enjoyed Thor Ragnarok.

So that set the movie off at with very high expectation indeed. Helas part in the story was as expected,\nand nothing changed from the trailers. Shes very powerful, and also very single-minded. Hulks treatment in the film\nwas in two parts - when he was the Hulk, he was a star, but when he was not hulk, he was a bit part player. Im not sure\nI liked how his role was handled in the film, but I suppose anymore exposure of the Hulk, would have taken the shine off\nThor himself. So maybe its understandable. I personally felt that more could have been made of the Hulks character.\nWhat did make the film stand out though was the comedy. It was very unexpected, and also brilliantly done! Along the\nway, Thor meets a minor gladiator, who turns out to be the funniest guy ever! Youll have to see for yourself, but his\ndeadpan delivery turns the film almost into a comedy, every time hes on the screen! The battle scenes were good, but\nnot to the level of LOTR, for scope and spectacle. I enjoyed it, but I feel that it fell just a little bit short of the\nstandard that Wonder Woman delivered. But it did set up the forthcoming space-based Marvel films very well (Black\nPanther was not referenced).",

Hulk and Thor were\nbrilliant in this film, CGI was the best Ive seen for the Hulk, and his scenes with Thor are hilariously funny. Hella\nwas hellish and I loved it, her story interestingly made sense tying her into the movie and not making it feel forced.\nSupporting cast of Valkyrie, Skurge, Korg, Grandmaster, Loki, Odin etc... all had their place and they all had their\nmoments to shine, which is hard to do in a movie with a plethora of characters. Only thing to note is the pacing is\nsometimes a bit abrupt going to and from other stories happening within the movie, but its not a biggy at all. One\nsmall thing is some impactful and emotional scenes (which youll know what Im talking about) didnt feel like it had\nthe depth or impact that it should of \" Maybe its just me, but Ill see this movie a few more times over and maybe edit\nthis as I would have had more time to reflect on it. All in all, from start to finish Ragnarok is a roller coaster ride\nof beautiful action pieces, quirky and snappy humor and a flagship for other Superhero movies to strive Thor!",

    "reviewBody": "Thor has never been my favourite avenger. Although I quite enjoyed his first movie, I hated the second one, and didnt\nquite know what to expect with this one. However, I absolutely loved it! In the opening scene the humour felt a bit\nawkward but it quickly gets better throughout, and had the whole cinema of people laughing. Ive seen several people\ncompare it to Guardians Of The Galaxy which I think is quite accurate.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) was brilliant in this\nmovie. He suited the humour really well and played it up quite a bit. It also wouldnt be a Thor film if we didnt have\na shirtless scene at some point, and whos complaining to be honest. In my opinion the character was a lot better\nwithout the annoying love interest of Jane, who for me personally brought absolutely nothing to the first two movies.\nShe is conveniently tied off when some random human mentions that she dumped Thor, and thats all we hear about her at\nall. I think the Valkyrie is supposed to be the new love interest, and she shared one or two little moments with Thor\nthroughout the film which was nice. Shes a drunk, feisty Asgardian and at least she has more personality than Jane.\nJust saying, sorry to any Jane fans out there. The dynamic between Thor and Hulk was pretty fun too and he was a welcome\naddition to the film.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is amazing as always. Im a bit of a Loki fangirl to be honest so Im\nslightly biased, but he was funny as ever. We still dont really know what hes doing, as at some points he tries to\nsave Thor and the next he betrays him again, which is kind of annoying. The thing that still hasnt been explained from\nthe first movie though is if he is a frost giant why does he have godly powers? I dont understand! Anyway at the end\nthere are some brotherly bonding moments, and all seems pretty good between them. For now.The absolute best new\ncharacter was Korg. A lot of the best jokes came from him and I hope we see more of this character at some point. Hela\nwas also quite a good villain, she had a straightforward aim and plan, which makes a change from Lokis confusing plots.\nKinda feel a little sorry for her but not really.Lets talk a little about the plot. Thor wants to prevent Ragnarok,\nwhich you probably know as basically the doomsday of Norse mythology. Whilst on Midgard discussing it with Odin, Odin\npasses away, meaning Thors evil sister is released from wherever Odins magic was containing her. The thing that seemed\na little strange to me as that nobody knew who Hela was? She was around when Odin was conquering the nine realms, so do\nno Asgardians remember that? Im also not sure about the whole evil sister thing, we kind of already had that with Loki\nbut oh well. Also if Hela is literally the goddess of death why cant she just kill everyone with a click of her fingers\nif shes so super powerful and everything, like how Thor can summon lightening. Oh well.As usual with Marvel films,\ngreat songs, cinematography and special effects. Fight scenes were good, plenty of badass moments.Honestly this is the\nbest Thor film, go watch it. Its a good laugh and great action and you wont be disappointed.",

    "reviewBody": "If you like your comicbook superhero films full of one-liners, nonsensical plotting, drastic character changes,\nunderdeveloped villains, missing important characters (for no other reason other than they were probably unavailable)\nthen Thor 3 is right up your street. For me, its another wasted opportunity. For the record, I loved Thor 1, disliked\nThor 2 and Thor 3 is perhaps a slightly better film than the second one, but Im rating it lower because it had the\nopportunity to be so much more than what it was. Ragnarok should not be a comedy buddy film. The consistent comedy\nplayed throughout this film (which is literally from the first scene until the last) just feels so out of place in a\nfilm that has what should be an epic and profound story. In the context of the film, it removes any semblance of doom,\nor indeed care to the main characters - if they are able to laugh and joke about the situation, why the hell should you\nas a viewer care? This comedic attitude spoils what could have been an epic story line. Right from Thor uncovering\nLokis deception (and his reaction to that most heinous crime which is somewhat unbelievable) to Kiwi Gladiators\nconstantly cracking jokes in the arena which should be a life or death situation (and in turn, reducing the middle act\nto a ponderous, overtly long section that is only there to bring Hulk and Thor together), to the most ridiculous\ncharacter motivational change in the history of Marvel films (looking at you Valkyrie), Thor 3 is a completely wasted\nstory that fails to live up to the hype on almost every conceivable level. I say \"almost\" as the Hulk once again proves\na success, adding a layer of development we seem to get to his character in every Marvel film he is in. Other new and\nreturning characters do not fair so well. Im trying to understand why Tessa Thompson was raved about so much. Forgiving\nthat the character has been completely redesigned from the comicbooks, she is so underdeveloped I have little\ncomprehension why she hates Asgard in the first place, and then returns so quickly by Thors side. Perhaps the tequila\nwore off. Theres nothing wrong with her performance, there just isnt anything three-dimensional to her character.\nLoki. God Loki. Hes just Loki. Again. It doesnt matter what this guy does, hes just constantly forgiven - for\nabsolutely no reason when his crimes are looked at in the cold light of day. For Gods sake Thor, Hela was attempting to\ndo nothing that Loki had already done. It makes no sense. As for Scurge...was he actually even in it? Why was he in it?\nWhat purpose did he have?Hela - well, as a design and character, she looked the part, had an awesome power set and an\ninteresting take on things. She probably had some really great reasons for doing what she was doing, when she was doing\nthem. We just, like every other Marvel villain, never get to fully flesh them out. I cant help but think there was a\ngreat character there, played by the right person, but its never truly allowed to flourish and gather weight. The\n\"re-writing\" of the Universe is also a little hard to take with her introduction. Nobody seems to question it. Everybody\njust accepts it. Not for me Im afraid. Heres hoping that Avengers 3 can bring this MCU ship back, cause at the moment,\nthe last two films have veered massively off course.",

    "reviewBody": "Thor RagnarokFor me the first two solo outings of the guy with the 80s hair and big hammer were average at best. Thors\nturn in the two Avengers movies was much better, but his ability to carry a movie by himself seemed too heavy for those\nridiculously large biceps of his. Not that this was anything to do with Chris Hemsworths performance. Certainly not, it\nwas more to do with the blandness of the actual character.In this third solo movie the creators have gone to town. This\nis a full blown comedy first, superhero movie second, and for the most part it works well. The storyline is pretty much\npainting by numbers superhero stuff but its the way its delivered that makes this movie such an enjoyable experience.\nHemsworth is allowed to exercise his comedic chops and many of the improvised scenes work to side splitting effect. An\nequally funny supporting cast all seem to be having a good time. Cate Blanchett brings a level of sophistication to her\nsexy villainous role and Jeff Goldblum lights up the screen at every opportunity.The hulk has never looked better. Far\ngone are the days of early CGI Hulk when he looked like a cartoon superimposed onto screen. He is given a bit of depth\nhere instead of just being the big green angry guy that smashes the snot out of everyone. Still, he does do quite a lot\nof snot smashing, but hey, it wouldnt be the hulk otherwise. Karl Urban does a cockney accent, at least I think thats\nwhat it was and Idris Elba shows up. Most likely to honour his contract. His appearance is welcome though as hes cool\nin everything he appears in.I havent gone in to too much about the plot as to be honest I cant remember what the hell\nthis was all about. I just know I had a good time and by the looks of it everyone involved did so too.",

    "reviewBody": "I will try not to give out any spoilers, but at the same time I must warn you about this movie, yes, you read it right,\nwarn you.We all know the Thor movies are not exactly the brightest gem in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but after the\nmistakes of Thor: The Dark World you would think they would have learned their lesson, after all this movie is the end\nof the trilogy and I am personally happy it finally ends.The movie tries to mix two classic stories from the comics:\nRagnarok and Planet Hulk, very ambitious I must say, but this is a blend that will make you ill, let me explain you\nwhy.The movie is 130 minutes long, yet one of the greatest and more powerful villains the MCU has ever had, Hela, only\ngets about 20 minutes of screen time, and in those 20 minutes you can see Cate Blanchett trying her hardest to give\ndepth to the character, but even someone as immensely talented as her cannot pull the impossible, Hela, The Goddess of\nDeath has been turned into a 2 dimensional cartoon.The first act is pretty weak, and you can see the script rushes as\nmuch as they possibly can to get to the second act, which is where they try to adapt Planet Hulk, and that part takes\nmost of the screen time and it is so boring it is not even funny. They tried to integrate a space opera of revolution\nagainst an evil dictator into the story of Ragnarok, but it is rushed, contrived and boring, and I mean mind boggling\nboring.Then we get to the third act where the battle takes place in Asgard and Helas army fights \"The Revengers\", I\nwont spoil any further but I will say that when you think quality will improve, it does not, not one bit.This entry has\nto be hands down one of the worst movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am an MCU fan boy but I have to be truthful,\nand I give it 6/10, and I am being nice. This was an amalgamation of two stories that could have been great as separate\nentities, but not combined, at least not in the incompetent hands of Taika Waititi, who does not deserve respect at all.",

    "reviewTitle": "A much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok is the third standalone Thor movie and the fifth film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nDirected by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), this installment gives the Thor films a much needed jolt of life\nthat was lacking greatly in its two predecessors.Two years after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (Chris\nHemsworth) finds himself imprisoned on a distant planet where he is forced to do battle in a gladiatorial duel against\nhis former friend, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Meanwhile, Thors home realm of Asgard is under attack by the powerful Hela\n(Cate Blanchett), who plans to bring it to an end during the oncoming apocalyptic event known as Ragnarok.Considering\nhow bleak and serious the first two Thor films were (mainly the second film), Thor: Ragnarok thankfully takes a\ndifferent route by injecting more humour and colour into the story to become one of the most fun and entertaining films\nin the MCU to date. All of the films comedic moments worked well, and didnt feel as though they were just inserted for\nthe sake of generic comic relief. Another issue I feel is that the original two focused too much on Loki (Tom\nHiddleston), making us forget that Thor was supposed to be the main character. Thankfully, Loki, while still having an\nimportant and amusing role in the story, is merely a supporting character and Thor himself is given the proper\ndevelopment needed to move the film along nicely. As with all films in the MCU, be sure to stay after the credits for\ntwo bonus scenes.I rate it 8/10",

In the meantime, he has to race against time to stop an evil force destroying Asgard.Perhaps\ninspired by the success of \"Deadpool\", \"Thor: Ragnarok\" has comedic elements beefed way up. It gets to a point where I\nthink there is too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, the balance of comedy and heroic action is\nsuccessfully struck by the middle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film induces giggles, but do not\ndistract viewers from the story. The story is intense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yet chill\ninducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any of her previous film. I feel a little sad about what\nhappens to the main character, and I wish it did not turn out that way. I enjoyed watching it, even though I wish the\nsuperhero elements is emphasised more.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor: Ragnarok Review",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok is coming out at a time where people are starting to ask if we have reached comic book fatigue. To that,\nThor: Ragnarok puts a big cross through that thought. Thor changes the game. We cant get tired of a sub-genre when the\nfilms keep reinventing themselves every time.Ragnarok is a blast start to finish. If you are someone who liked laughing,\nthen you will have a smile from start to finish. Every bit of humour hits and if you are an Australian like me, you will\nget a kick out of a few jokes.If Ragnarok was a chain, there would not be a weak link. While some links are weaker than\nothers, there is no outright weak part of the film. Everything was at the minimum, just solid.Every character felt like\nlike they were used close to their potential. Every actor and actress put in the performance they needed. You felt like\n99% of characters were done perfectly. The only slight complaint that can be had about characters in this film was the\nvillain of Hella.Like most Marvel villains, she is terrifically performed by Kate Blanchett and she is a force when she\nneeds to be, but by the time Black Panther comes around next year, she will be quite forgettable. What they did do well\nwith her however was use her to set up some terrific Thor history.As mentioned, the humour was outstanding, and I think\nthat comes down to Taika Waititi. While he didnt get a writing credit on the film, you know by the style of the humour\nthat he had a lot of input into what was happening on screen.While still on Taika, his directing was fantastic. There\nare some shots in this film that I want as a wallpaper because they are look like they should be paintings. The action\nwas shot really well, the emotional moments had an intimate to them and of course the wide shots of the landscapes were\nbrilliant.Something I really noticed this is the use of the music. They really tapped into the Guardians music style and\nit worked so well with what was happening on screen. They had a nice balance of using songs when needed but working in\nscore when it is much needed.Ragnorok is a film that if you are going to have a problem with something, chances are it\nis going to be something personal. For me, what stood out as a negative was the pacing, however that comes of the back\nof a massive positive. This film is trying to balance two stories that could have easily been a film separately, and\ndoes a really good job of it, however I felt as though the Ragnorok story line did feel a bit short changed at the end.\nThey weave the two stories well but at the end of the day, Thor can only be present in one story at a time.Overall,\nThor: Ragnorok is a blast from start to finish. It captured the humour and light hearted fun that the first Guardians\nhad and took it to a level you wouldnt of been able to think of. Taika Waititi was by far the stand out of the film\nboth infront and behind the camera, and it couldnt have been achieved without him. As mention, if the film was a chain,\nthe weakest link would still be over 90% strong.9.5/10",

    "reviewTitle": "This movie failed in every possible level.",
    "reviewBody": "Im not a hater of comic book-based movies, and it is difficult, considering 2/5 of the movies that appear in movie\ntheaters are based on comic book, if you want to see a movie with action and effects, in the end you always end up with\none or another of this type of movie. Blame Hollywood and the mentality of wanting to get the milk from the cow in\ngreater quantity in the shortest possible time.And this movie fails on almost every level, first, the movie begins with\na set piece when Thor confronts a fire demon, before this, begins a monologue of this demon on Ragnarok. Honestly, who\nwas the amateur puts such a big exposition before an action scene. And in the midst of these two things, Thor begins to\nmake jokes about being attached to chains. Honestly the editing of this movie is horrible.And that goes for the whole\nmovie. Another example, Odin ends up dying at the end of the first act, and soon afterwards appears an action scene with\nHela. The public still barely chewed Odins death scene - scene loses all emotional impact - a set piece appears which\nshould have an emotional impact - the destruction of Thors hammer - turns out to have no impact at all. Worse, both\nscenes lost their impact and ended up canceling each other out.The editing is so horrible, the pace is so fast that not\nonly the emotional scenes lose their emotional focus, the action scenes are flawed and the suspense scenes do not work\nand the whole movie is gone down the drain, in which the movie can not be chewed and the movie looks like a Mcdonalds\nmeal. Just a factory product. In addition, the film addresses the destruction of a civilization and a race - in this\ncase Asgard - of such a simplistic manners, and in such a hurried way. This film needs (at least) 3 hours for\ndevelopment and make an satisfactory establish for the final battle (considering how many subplots this movie has),\ninstead this is a 2 hours film of second-rate jokes.A movie to fill your eyes, but nothing is left in the mind and\nbecause of this movie is easily forgotten after the credits pass. Even the special effects are horrendous. The Hulk\ncontinues to be a digital doll and being made by a computer - whats the point of putting the Hulk in the film, but as a\nway to call more fanboys and sell more tickets, if the Hulk were not in the movie, this movie would make a smaller\nbox-office and less money would went into Disneys account. Not to mention the big wolf, like the hulk, is a\ncomputer-made digital doll. The effects that should have been the decoy of the film are amateurs and lousy. Everything\nin this film fails. In other words, this movie as blockbuster fails to show grandiose special effects and action scenes,\nthe movie fails at all levels. Look, I hate Avatar, but James Cameron knows how to make a great visual spectacle with\ngreat action scenes, a beautiful but empty movie. Thor 3 is rubbish at all levels, especially in its proposal (special\neffects and action scenes). And this for me this is the biggest sin of this movie, because this movie failed in all its\nobjectives.",

One of the biggest positives of the movie is it has the right amount of known/beloved\ncharacters and new/exciting characters. However, as a negative aspect of this movie, I would say this is the most\nMarvelish movie yet. They treat everything as an opportunity for a goof. However, thanks to the chemistry between\nHulk-Thor-Loki, it will be a stand-out movie in the highly crowded MCU. To sum it up this movie was a riot from start to\nfinish.

If you dislike Marvel Studio\nfilms (why?) then this one isnt going to convince you to jump on board with the MCU. Thor and Hulk/Banner team up and\nthe banter between the two is at times very funny. Tessa Thompson did give a decent performance as Brunnhilde, but to be\nhonest, Id rather have had Jaimie Alexanders Sif in this flick as weve got history with that character. However, I\ndefinitely see Brunnhilde becoming integral part of the MCU and can see her character being expanded upon if they make a\nThor 4.The soundtrack (which I loved), CGI, and action all complement the movie. Taika Waititi directing was, as always\nsuperb and I would love to see Marvel Studios give him more projects to work on. I think his humor would fit Spider-Man\nor Iron Man pretty well. The reason this doesnt get ten stars because yet again the villain is underdeveloped and\nalthough were told time and time again that Hela is this all powerful Goddess I dont quite feel it. I cant really\ndiscuss it without going into spoilers, but I found the character underwhelming a bit. However, Cate Blanchett was\namazing both to look at and her performance. I would highly recommend you go see this. Probably best Superhero movie of\nthe year in my opinion.",

Unfortunately your failure in the past was to have sold the copyright to some\nof his heroes to other producers, that tactic was used not to break in a time of crisis of movie heroes. With the\nexplosion of movies from Spider-man (2002) the company carried on and went back to producing movies of their heroes. The\nfirst Thor movie was released in 2011, and it was a great movie. I recall the success this film has done at the time.\nbut the second film Thor the dark world (2013) are no longer managed to be so good. Film has multiple errors in the\nnarrative and it was very confusing, and had no villain.Thor Ragnarok begins two years after the Avengers (2012). Thor\nis the defending world and still does not know that your brother seized the Throne from his father in the second movie.\nUpon returning to Asgard discovers that your brother is leading and that your father is missing.

Film is very well written, has amazing graphics and\nimpresses in the narrative. Hulk works great the hero is in your best shape and performance since the Avengers (2012),\nwho had an excellent performance and left the film even more complete. Cate Blanchett (Hela) has an impeccable\nperformance to me she was a great villain of the Marvel movies, your character really scary. The film is full of action\nwith a quality humor without being forced. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) still has a great chemistry\non screen that has been creating over the time together really work well and makes the story even more fluid. Marvel hit\nmovie and managed to overcome other great long as, Avengers (2012) and Civil War (2016).The third film of Thor is the\nbest Marvel movie ever made! Time for fun is guaranteed.

    "reviewTitle": "Ugly, badly paced, thinly written, tonally uneven and worst of all: unfunny, despite its desperate attempts.",
    "reviewBody": "Disorienting, loud and ugly, often all at the same time, Thor: Ragnarok boasts a cast of great Marvel characters and\nrich mythological storytelling--but squanders its potential by being nothing more than a paint by numbers action/comedy\nwith a tone stuck somewhere between a Michael Bay film and a bad SNL skit. What makes it worse is that every attempt at\ncomedy fails completely, and either kills the tension (not that there is much in the first place) or distracts from the\nplot. The plot is thin and glossed over, and the characters... there are none. Every character in this film is doing\nroughly the same thing-- a bit. A comedy bit to make the audience laugh. There is no real depth or humanity to this\nfilm, just jokes and bad CGI held together with more jokes. Awful choreography and sound design and basically no camera\nwork at all, the film is shot like its a Clerks movie and is very bland to watch. I hope director Taika Waititi keeps\naway from blockbusters in the future--if only to save himself from anymore embarrassment. The already weak Thor trilogy\nends on its lowest low. How Marvel has fallen.",

    "reviewTitle": "Fine for what it is....",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok (2017, Taika Waititi) In last years mega-hit film Captain America: Civil War we saw pretty much all of\nthe earthbound Marvel characters turn up except Thor and The Hulk/Bruce Banner. So now its time for us to see what they\nhave been up to in the meantime. New Zealand indie director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) works with a\nbudget for the first time to bring us the third entry in the Thor series that looks and feels more like a Guardians of\nthe Galaxy film in many ways. We have a film set mostly in space and other planets with colorful and goofy characters\neverywhere and jokes inserted into every scene... but unlike Guardians and the other better MCU films.. this one lacks\nany emotional resonance.The story telling is a bit of a jumbled mess but tries to blow through plot points so fast that\nyou might not notice. The action scenes are effects heavy but lack excitement, stakes or tension. Despite its many\nshortcomings though it is fast enough and funny enough to entertain throughout. The highlights for me were Mark Ruffalo\nas Bruce Banner and the director himself as a humorous side character names Korg. Hemsworth was great as always as Thor\nand Tessa Thompson did not disappoint as Valkyrie.The new thing that I noticed atmosphere wise was a much more\ninteresting score than the traditional MCU films have had with a mostly Synth based score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh\n(The Lego Movie), who is an unusual choice for score but it paid dividends. In the end the film is not a great film, nor\na bad film but an inconsequential yet funny film.5.5/10",

    "reviewBody": "I honestly came to the cinema with high expectation, especially knowing that Hulk and Doctor Strange will feature in the\nmovie. However after I spent the hours of watching, I would like to say that it was an okay movie but not really\nsomething really memorable.Aside of the stunning CGI, the humor are pretty much not as hilarious as usual. They still\nare funny, but some came to be failed though.The plot were pretty predictable, and it was lack of depth. I would not put\nthings in detail since it will be a spoiler but overall, it did not impress as much as other Marvels project this year.\nThe villain was cool, but the battle and how they get the victory was pretty, how would I say it, not as thrilling as I\nexpected.As the sum up, this movie was more to classic super hero plot where the hero get some problem then gain\nincredible improvement in his power then win the battle thing than something with surprise and lack of depth or plot\ndevelopment aspect. But it will still be a good movie for you to watch at home on your laptop while needing something\nentertaining as a companion.",

    "reviewBody": "Went to see Thor: Ragnarok with an open mind as I am a regular movie goer, at least once a week year in year out. Was\nnot expecting anything beyond the usual Marvel output which is usually reasonably entertaining. Ragnarok, falls short in\na number of ways not the least of which was the annoying attempts at humor. The humor was puerile and aimed more at the\nprepubescent rather than anyone with a developed sense of humor above the most rudimentary level, as evidenced by the\nfact that in a theater of some 400 mainly Millennials there was only one collective laugh and that was Thor and the\nbowling ball. Apart from that there only a couple of isolated titters. The movie on the whole appears to be aimed at a\nGrade School intellect, starting from the ridiculous lead in intro with Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Waititi, and a movie fan\nprior to the movie commencing. The movie relied far too much on CGI which wasnt up to standard and over the top at\ntimes. Hemsworths performance is generic and bland while Ruffalo puts in his usual average effort. Blanchett was the\nStar of the show while the rest of the cast were OK but dont blink or you will miss Idris Elbas performance. Looking\nat the 10/10s given on IMDb on opening day one can only assume they are from studio/corporate hacks to boost the ratings\nrather than from genuine IMDb contributors.

    "reviewTitle": "My head is Thor",
    "reviewBody": "I went in to this film maybe a little too expectant, I love Marvel, love the Thor comic character, and love the way\nChris Hemsworth portrays him on the screen. However, this film is COMPLETELY different to every other portrayal of Thor\nand it doesnt work. Thors comedy has generally stemmed from his failure to integrate with humans on earth, when he was\non Asgard he was this regal, well versed, humble, albeit slightly cocky character, yet from his first scene you can tell\nthe film is taking a completely different route with him. And this is where the main problem of the film lies. For a\nfilm called \"Ragnarok\", which is basically about the death  destruction of Asgard, there is too much of a light tone\nthroughout this film and WAY TOO much \"comic\" dialogue - I put that in speech marks as a lot of the one liners do not\nwork and fall flat, and this is purely because of the sheer volume of them in the film. Comedy only works when there is\na straight man to work off, yet nearly every character in the film is written the same and thus loses their\nindividuality. This is such a shame as it causes the film to lose all impact on the sad or serious moments. Within the\nfirst 30 minutes Thor discovers the Loki is posing as Odin and, instead of being A: amazed hes still alive, and B: Hes\nsomehow banished his all powerful father, he simply laughs this off as a little joke Loki has played, then when they\nfind Odin and he subsequently \"dies\" just before they meet Hela, who then goes on to destroy Mjolnir, there is no\nmourning period and before you know it were on Sakaar being treated to no end of electrocution jokes.(Though isnt Thor\nthe god of Thunder and can summon lightning?? Why would he be incapacitated by an electric shock?)Its such a shame\nthat, as Thor has just lost 2 of the most important things to him, this isnt given time to sink in or be dealt with and\nis just glazed over with a quick childish argument with the Hulk.Its not all bad though, I found once on Sakaar the\nfilm picked up somewhat. The Hulk/Thor fight doesnt disappoint, and there were a couple of nice character additions\nhere, the Grandmaster was better than I thought he would be and wasnt too \"Goldblum\", Korg is probably the funniest\npart of this film and his comic lines do work well, I would like to see him return again. Hulk is fleshed out a bit more\nas well and we continue to see the internal struggle between him and Banner during the film. Another addition is Skurge\nwho, the less said about him, the better..! Pointless, waste of time being in the film. Valkyrie is a strange character,\nI know she was completely changed from the comic books, but I dont think that the character is particularly well\ndeveloped and thus I wasnt really invested in her at all during the movie. I also think the part quite easily could\nhave been portrayed by Lady Sif, (who is strangely absent in the film despite the warriors 3 appearing??) And would have\nhad more impact in the plot than the reasoning behind Valkyries self imposed exile. But the main plus point from the\nfilm, which is music to Marvel fans ears, is Hela is a success as a villain, it has been a long time since weve had a\nvillain to rival Loki (who FYI is wasted in the film and is getting a bit annoying now) but Hela is great, we got some\ndevelopment in to her character, albeit a little small, but I very much look forward to her appearing in Infinity War so\nwe can hopefully develop her further.So whilst its not the best Marvel film, its certainly not the worst by a long\nshot. I did enjoy it, it was just the constant barrage of jokes wore very thin very quickly and definitely detracted\nfrom the overall story. But with all this said, my non fan boy friend loved the film....!",

    "reviewTitle": "Many things frustrated me",
    "reviewBody": "This isnt really a review per se, I just needed somewhere to get things off my chest about this movie.So heres a list\nof things that bothered me:One thing I love about the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe is the continuity. Most movie\nfranchises are fairly relaxed on continuity (which I am very opposed to), or in some cases blatantly disregard it (Foxs\nX-Men franchise, for example), so its really nice to have a big franchise where everything little thing adds up.\nHowever, unless Im missing something, Ragnarok screws that up.In The last Thor movie, The Dark World, it is stated that\nAsgardians live for roughly 5,000 years. This is later corroborated when we learn the convergence of the nine realms\n(seemingly coincidentally) also happens every 5,000 years, and Odins father, Bor (then King of Asgard), was the one who\ndealt with Malekith at the previous convergence (therefore, implying that Odin had either not been born at this point,\nor was a baby / young child).Yet in Ragnarok, the history revealed between Odin and Hela suggests Odin has been around a\nlot longer than that, even that he may have been the first Asgardian, but from The Dark World, we know he had a father\n(Bor) and a grandfather (Buri). And in the first scene of Ragnarok, Thor says he thought his father killed Surtur the\nFire Giant \"half a million years ago\". This just doesnt add up.The huge cliffhanger at the end of The Dark World, Loki\nsecretly being on the throne of Asgard, disguised as Odin, is simply disregarded, thrown away as a joke. People had been\nwaiting for the pay-off from that cliffhanger for four years, and its just wasted.The Warriors Three, Thors closest\nfriends, are all killed off nonchalantly, and there is no recognition of that whatsoever from Thor. His three closest\nfriends all killed, nothing.Where is Lady Sif? She isnt mentioned once. No concern from Thor, its like she doesnt\nexist.Supporting characters from the previous Thor movies are disregarded, no mention of them, bar Jane, who is written\nout with two lines of dialogue explaining her and Thor broke-up. Again, played for laughs. It renders the relationship\nbetween them built up in previous movies pointless.It ruins one of The Dark Worlds few good scenes. Lokis sacrifice.\nCompletely makes a mockery of it, now it will never be able to be taken seriously by anyone watching The Dark World\nagain.The previous points show this movie is disrespectful of what came before it and the work others had put into the\nfranchise.Loki is wasted, nothing interesting happens with his character this time around, hes just there for laughs,\nlike everyone else in this movie. Bear in mind he is a fan-favorite who hasnt been seen on- screen in four years.Doctor\nStranges role in the movie doesnt feel natural at all, its very out of place, and somewhat jarring. It isnt even a\ncameo really, its blatant product placement for his movie. Theyre hoping people who skipped Doctor Strange will pick\nit up on Blu-ray / DVD after seeing his scene in Thor: Ragnarok.With Mjlnir seemingly permanently destroyed (There would\nbe no reason to bring it back, as Thor would have no need for it now anyway, seeing as it was revealed it simply helped\nhim wield his power, rather than provide it), does that mean we wont get the long fantasied (and teased in Avengers:\nAge of Ultron) scene of Captain America triumphantly lifting it in a future Avengers movie?The attempted humor in the\nopening scene makes me cringe. Half of the gags after that are just people falling over or being knocked over by\nsomething, as if its written by Miranda Hart. Without Jeff Goldblum or the character Korg, the humor in this movie\nwould be painful.There is no sense of threat or weight to anything that happens because of the relentlessly slapstick\ntone. You just dont care about any of it. If the characters dont take their situation seriously, why should the\naudience care?The entire population of Asgard seems to be less than a hundred people. Honestly, I think I must be\nmissing something here, it was bizarre.Iron Man Three was originally meant to have an alcoholism subplot, which\npresumably would have been dealt with in a serious manner, yet Disney shot it down and so it didnt make it past the\nfirst draft of the script, presumably because they didnt think it would be suitable for children. Yet, here, in Thor:\nRagnarok, Valkyrie is very openly and repeatedly shown with her own alcohol problem, yet in this movie Valkyries\nalcoholism is played for laughs (as is everything else). Surely thats worse? Treating alcoholism as a joke, rather than\nportraying it in a serious manner in Iron Man Three. Which would you rather your children see alcoholism portrayed as? I\ndont understand the thinking here.So there you have it, thats what bugged me. Is it a fun movie? Sure, a few moments\nthat will make you smirk here and there, and some colorful action scenes, its entertaining, but for me, thats not\nworth all those issues I mentioned. Maybe Id feel differently if it had a good story or an interesting villain, but\ntheres just nothing of substance to it.",

    "reviewBody": "AfterSpider-Man: Homecoming andGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,it is time forThor: Ragnarok to try and finish a very\npositive year fortheMarvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), in great fashion.I find the previousThor movies very\ninterchangeable, they are not exactly great films, but they are still entertaining and enjoyable.However,Thor: Ragnarok\nelevates that same entertainment to a whole other level ... This is one of the funniest (!) and best movies of the\nentire universe.Opposed to the previous installments of the series, this one is tonally very different. The amount of\ncomedy implemented in the screenplay and the outstanding humor make this film surprisingly hilarious and extremely fun.\nIt is definitely a marvelous time at the theater and money very well spent.Taika Waititis(Hunt for the Wilderpeople)\nfantastic direction is all over the movie. He is able to achieve a flawless balance between comedy, drama and action,\nsomething that most directors have trouble with. Consequently, the pacing feels incredibly controlled throughout the\nwhole runtime. The 130 minutes fly like the blink of an eye and the film never has a dull moment, but it still slows\ndown when it needs to, without becoming boring.Waititialso applies a very interesting, intriguing and unconventional way\nof storytelling, which truly helps the movie carry itself since the overall narrative isnt really unusual. The visual\neffects and cinematography are both remarkable but in the last act, the action requires a lot of CGI, which becomes too\nheavy in some brief moments. Due to the mostly fictionalAsgard in the background, when the CGI isnt perfect, it feels\nlike a video game ... Thankfully, I am just nit-picking acouple of shots that, in the end, didnt bother me at all.Eric\nPearsons writing is distinctly exceptional with extremely hilarious lines and quite few exposition scenes (the ones\nthat exist dont feel forced at all, except for one or two very concise bits). I believe that he is responsible for a\nbig part of this films sense of uniqueness and creativity, considering he provides excellent scripts for every\ncharacter, upgrading each and every one of them and obtaining a more exciting movie.As for the cast, I just need to once\nagain praiseMarvel for its amazing choices, they keep nailing every single actor and actress they introduce to\ntheMCU.Cate Blanchett is unbelievable! She is such a wonderful actress that she can portray a super clich villain\nlikeHela (Marvels \"default\" villains are something that I honestly hopeThanos can change) and bring a whole other\ndimension to the character. Thanks to her and an extraordinary script,Hela does not feel like (what could very well have\nbeen) a cheap villain.Tessa Thompsonis another brilliant casting. Valkyrie adds a new layer of comedy and sass to the\nfilm, but her backstory is what gives both herself andBlanchetts charactera bit more of depth. The surprise of the\nwhole movie isKorg, a Kronan fighter portrayed by the one and only ...Taika Waititi! You are right, the director ofThor:\nRagnarok has the funniest performance of the film! I am far from joking, his lines almost steal the whole show, there\nisnt a single scene withKorg where I didnt laugh like crazy. It is going to be the audiences favorite, without a\ndoubt.As for the superstars,Chris Hemsworth proves that he is a perfectThor. Both his acting and body shape are\nexcellent for the portrayal of a god, he is able to be very compelling but also incredibly funny, carrying the story\nwith no slip-ups. His chemistry withMark Ruffalo andTom Hiddleston (Loki)is palpable and their dialogue scenes are\nalways at a great level of quality, both comedy and story-wise.Hiddleston is great as the evil brother, butHulk is the\none that stands out. The big green guy speaks more in this movie than in all of the others combined and he is freaking\nawesome! His witty one- liners hit every single time and his action scenes are amazing. There are also some short but\nvery cool appearances fromBenedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange),Idris Elba (Heimdall) andAnthony Hopkins (Odin), plus a\nsurprise performance from someone I wont spoil for you.Jeff Goldblum is always great, but his character ... I know this\nis not going to be a very popular opinion, but I findGrandmaster a bit annoying.Karl Urban has a good performance\nasSkurge, but just likeHela, both characters feel unexplored and pretty under- developed.My only real issue with the\nfilm is something I already mentioned above, which is the story itself. Even thoughWaititis uncommon storytelling\nelevates it, the overall narrative is pretty much the default superhero story. Basically, if you have been alive for the\npast 10 years, there is nothing about the screenplay that is going to surprise you or blow your mind. Thankfully, the\nmovie is so damn entertaining that the narrative becomes secondary to the all of the action and comedy predominant in\nthe film.In conclusion,Thor: Ragnarok is definitely worth your time and money. It is undoubtedly the best movie of the\nseries and one of the funniest in theMCU.Taika Waititi(with the help of Eric Pearson)molds a clich narrative in his very\nunique and humorous way of storytelling, packed with hilarious comedy and phenomenal action scenes. A splendid cast\nwithChris Hemsworth,Mark Ruffalo andCate Blanchett at the top of their game pull off some fabulous displays, but it\nisTessa Thompson andWaititi (!) that steal the show with their distinguished performances, plus a big green badass that\nhas a lot of funny one-liners.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)",

    "reviewTitle": "This Thor is Thor-some!",
    "reviewBody": "Frankly, I didnt like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old \"save the world\"\nroutines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same\nblueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and\nridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God dont die, hurt as much and can always employ one last\ndeus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost\ninto an unknown territory, making it this years best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended,\nbut looking at the trailer it doesnt take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.New Zealand\ndirector Taika Waititi seems like an unusual choice to helm Thors third standalone movie. He has the indie root in him\nand he makes superbly smart comedies with oddles of heart, just watch What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the\nWilderpeople (2016) to see his outstanding oeuvre. Apparently, the Marvel-Disney studios have given him full reins and\nhe went ahead and make a comedy. But how do you inject an indie comedic vibe into a superhero franchise that has not\nbeen done before?Essentially, Waititi throws out all the cumbersome weights that hampered Thor and tells a simpler but\nno less cool story about a superhero trying to get back to his home to clean house. In between he gives Thor ample\nopportunities to be a beer-swigging beefcake, negotiate some treacherously outlandish situations and strip him off the\none thing that makes him Thor, the Mjolnir. At one point, Odin even asks a defeated Thor \"What are you, the God of\nHammers? \" that had me laughing till my tears rolled down.The tone is light but no less serious, populated by so many\ncolourful characters in a vivid world trapped in impossible situations. At first I thought the introduction of Hulk in\nthe early trailer is a misstep, but Mark Ruffalos casting would have been close to impossible to keep under wraps. By\ngiving Planet Hulk comic fans a look-in would have been a better move. The repartee between Thor and Hulk/Banner is so\nhilarious. No less funny is also the dialogue between Thor and Loki, gone is that \"he aint heavy, he is my brother\"\nvibe and this is a Thor that will give Loki a smackdown if he is out of step.Cate Blanchett plays Thors estranged\nsister with evil relish and you dont cast Jeff Goldblum without allowing him to be Goldblum. Waititi even voices a\ngladiator-mentor character named Korg that practically steals all the scenes he is in. Chris Hemsworth hams it up just\nto a safe degree and nails all the one-liners with an A+. In fact, the whole cast seems to be having fun.Thor: Ragnarok\nembraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all\nthe bullseyes. In the midst of it all, it still manages to tell a super duper cool story of a superhero saving his\npeople. Yet it manages to remain fresh and zip along with a zany lightning pace. What an inspired choice for a director.\nThe risk taken will pay huge dividends. This has superb rewatch value and I already feel like buying another ticket just\nto catch all the one-liners one more time. This Thor is Thor-some!",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor reinventing himself with the backdrop of an 80s synth",
    "reviewBody": "Thor must stop Ragnark! Its back again: The Marvel machine. Pumping out more and more movies for you. This movie is\nwhat you expect. Its a fun, enjoyable party. Its difficult to hate it, because you realize the movie itself isnt\ntaking things that seriously. This time around they are more self-aware than usual. I liked that addition. Its true\nthat we are so many movies in and you question when it will get tiresome. But to my surprise they shape-shifted the\nfranchise again and got out on top. I never expected that I would like a third \"Thor\" film as much as I did. Its\nunexpected, but Im so glad they took some chances by not making the same movie again. If youve had a stressful week or\njust a bad day, then you will not have a good time watching something thats too dramatic. Thats when something like\n\"Ragnarok\" steps in. Its a nice refresher. Forget your problems for an hour and follow Thor while he jumps around with\n80s synth music. The first act is basically a classic \"Thor\" sequel. But things pick up as soon as our hero lands on\nSakaar, and the film enters an edgy science fiction zone. Its funny, full of great jokes. Its distracting at first\nbecause its obvious how much the humor has been turned up compared to some previous chapters. I easily started enjoying\nit though. Everyone had fun making this movie and that fun feeling transcends to me as well.Cate Blanchetts Hela is one\nof those scenery chewing villains. Its classic, but whenever we cut back to her it does feel like an entirely different\nfilm. Like with \"Homecoming\", I enjoyed the character interaction scenes more than the action. The final battle feels\nlike an easy training match. Its like we are on autopilot, but then again we get some neat visual elements. Every\nsupporting character is great for this story. The Hulk, Loki, Grandmaster, Valkyrie.. They are all like-able. Jeff\nGoldblum is playing himself and its fantastic for what it is. Also, the director of the movie plays one of the best new\ncharacters. There really isnt much that I can add to the things that everyone else already is saying. It would sound\nthat Im just repeating every other review for this film. The truth is that \"Ragnarok\" is a very laid-back watch with\nsome retro feels sprinkled in just the right scenes. Know this though; It doesnt strive to become emotionally engaging\nor inspirational in any way. It wont hit you in the feels as they say. But its a funny space party where every friend\nis included and appreciated.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor is uneven but just so much fun",
    "reviewBody": "This film is ridiculous.Lets get that out of the way but really any film with Thor in it let alone any of the Avengers\nis by definition, batshit crazy.The exception here is that Taika Waititi embraces the Crazy, he fosters it and it does\npay off. Remember how bad Thor: Dark World was? Probably not, because like most traumatic incidents you have lost the\nmemory. Where could Thor take a standalone film that was enjoyable and still maintain a link to the Avengers universe?\nPlanet Hulk is where! The Marvel alchemists have taken numerous strands of lore and swirled them together to concoct the\nbreathiest and most colourful confection in their short history. Guardians was funny because the characters were funny\nwhile Thor is funny because he is in on the joke.The problem then becomes one of tone. The film is peppering so many\njokes and self deprecating nods that the structure becomes uneven which is most seen when the film creaks into Hero\nmode...you can hear the gears grinding.I am not a huge fan of Hemsworth but he is his most likable here and seems\nreinvigorated once that famous haircut takes place. The rest of the cast is amazing: Blanchett, Goldblum, Ruffalo,\nHopkins and so on. There is just not enough time to go round. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Hela and totally absorbs\nthe screen whenever she is on. The character is underwritten and she still wrings something memorable from it.The film\nlooks fantastic and most especially when they save their money shots for the big battles. Waititi employs a specific\ncolour palette at times such as the Valkyrie battle which resembles a moving Renaissance painting and it is\nmagnificent.The big question will be whether audiences buy into Waititis gamble. Will they laugh at the NZ accents as\nKorg says \"Bro\" and \"New Doug\"? If they do this will be a huge hit and a shot in the arm for the extended Marvel\nuniverse.",

But damn it was awesome to be blown away like\nthat.For anyone who might not have loved the first two Thor movies, should not let them keep you from seeing this\none.Its so utterly different, colorful and funny, its like Avengers/Guardians mixed together.There was several truly\nepic scenes, and lots of awesome action scenes throughout the movie, with lots of humour and soul to it.The story\nworked well, without trying to be complicated, but enough twist here and there to keep the movie from feeling\ntransparent.If you are looking for a funny and very entertaining movie, Thor Ragnorock wont disappoint at all.Very\nlikely to rank as the best MCU movie yet.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Film Ive seen yet!",
    "reviewBody": "The film started off with more than I expected. A few issues I did notice was that several trailer bits were cut out of\nthe film. The three warriors could have had a bit more to do before dying. Sif should have been in the film as a hero\nbut as long as Marvel still use her. The new characters Korg, Skurge, Hela and Valkryie were very interesting. Another\nclever thing the film did was put the Doctor Strange post credit scene into the film which was quite clever. This film\nwas way better than the first Avengers. A lot of the films are better than Avengers but people just dont get that.\nUltron was better, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 should be rated higher than\nAvengers so I expect any true fans to rate Thor Ragnarok higher.It deserves 10 or 9 but certainly no lower than 8.\nAvengers Infinity War I fear may ruin the ending for this film, especially if all the surviving Asgardians are killed by\nThanos like the Infinity War trailer showed.Loki and Thor did some funny things like the \"get help\" thing. Bruce Banner\nremained as Hulk for two years is a bit bizarre. If he does now permanently stay as Hulk then it suggests that his actor\nis quitting. Korg and Heimdall need to return some day for more action. Now that you know some viewpoints, go and watch\nthis. Youll definitely be pleased if you do.",

    "reviewBody": "Ive been rather tepid towards the MCU since the get-go. Dont get me wrong, Ive enjoyed individual films but Ive\nnever really been hanging out for the next installment. However, the previews for this one did pique my interest so when\nI was invited to go see it by some friends I decided to make the effort (rather than waiting for it on Foxtel like I\nhave for the last few).Im glad I went.The best word for this film really is romp. Its fun, its energetic and its\noften hilarious to watch. Its a complete tone change from the previous two Thor movies - the second in particular - and\nits all the better for it. While its a shame that some familiar characters couldnt make an appearance, and some did\nonly briefly, I dont think the movie suffers horribly for their absence. The story holds together pretty well, in my\nopinion, and I didnt notice any glaring plot holes.Kudos to everyone involved in this film, especially director Taika\nWaititi. I had a lot of fun watching it and I hope that other people will too.",

    "reviewTitle": "Guardian of the Galaxy : Ragnarok",
    "reviewBody": "I dont know where to start. I love MCU superhero movie. Thor is my favorite after Captain American and Doctor Strange.\nThe first movie was good, the second was outstanding, and when I hear Ragnarok will be the third (and probably last)\nThor movie, Im thrill. I hope this movie gonna be majestic like lord of the ring movie, aaaaand we got this awful\nmovie.Ragnarog should be the perfect conclusion for Thor trilogy, especially when you have Anthony Hopkins and Cate\nBlanchett in it. F**kin Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett !!! Whats wrong with you people !!Dark and gritty theme is\nnot for all superhero movie. And vice versa, not all movies can be made as comedy budy action. Leave that genre to\nGuardian of the Galaxy. Thor is meant to be be Shakespeares Norse mythology movie. What makes GOG works, because they\nable to develop their great characters and the relation between. Hell even GOG Vol 2 know how to pull a line somewhere\nbetween their jokes and make me cry in the end of the movie. Thor : Ragnarog is just bad rip off from GOG with plenty of\nmiss-placed jokes.I also disappointed with wasted talents of great actors. You will be fascinated in the first 10\nminutes Cate Blanchett. But after that, just bland acting, bad dialogue and the editing is the worst. At least make\npowerful and touching dialogue between Thor, Odin and Hela, as theyre presented by great actors. but noooooo. Hela has\nno special motivation, no expression, only an unclear desire to rules Asgard and other 9 realm.I dont get it with all\npeople who rating this movie above 5 and said it it the best MCU experience so far. Have you no respect for Winter\nSoldier, Doctor Strange, Civil Wars and the noise mythology? you guys need to watch more movie. certainly whatever my\nopinion, this movie will still make a lot of money. and I also have good time. Not great, but good",

The movie feels almost like a reboot that takes the Thor character in a new, less\nserious direction. The action remains but is surrounded by brighter colors and more campy characters (Jeff Goldblum as\nGrandmaster is a hoot and the wonderful Rachael House brings a sly tongue-in-cheek shade to Topaz). It looks like it was\nfun to make and it was fun to watch and, as Taika Waititi also bring a sweet emotional edge that resonates by the end.\nIf I have a question, it would have to be \"Where next?\" It seems that Thor is assembling his own team that includes The\nHulk and Loki. Will they go off on their own adventures? Will The Revengers return? I hope so.",

Its sad how creators only think of how to bring masses to\nthe theaters and thus the quality of the creation suffers. The main villain has no originality and all of her actions\nwere predictable, which has happened to most of the superhero villains recently. Theyre brought in for the sake of only\nthat one movie and get cast out before the end. Except for Loki. But in the end, nothing happens to him. (Tom Hiddleston\nlooked so hot in that all-black suit, though.) The acting was really great on most parts, but Mark Ruffalo was so\ndisappointing. Mostly it was bad script-writing for Bruce Banner, who was a joke in this movie, but he couldve\ndelivered his part so much better.Im mostly bringing out the \"bad parts\", but I really did like the movie. It just\nwasnt what it couldve been. I hope Marvel wont keep using the same pattern for all upcoming movies, soon it wont\nentertain even the masses theyre aiming for.",

Thor Ragnorak works in the sense that everyone does a pretty good job in the acting department, weve got\nCate Blanchett for Christs sake. If I have a problem with this movie, its that like most Marvel proper movies before\nit, its a cartoon. This is a movie for 14 year old kids, and thats OK, but its not a thinking mans movie.The other\nproblem is that suddenly cgi Hulk can carry on with coherent conversations, with no real explanation.

ILL TELL YOU BEFORE A SPOILER*THOR: RAGNAORK - 2017Directed by\nTaika_Waititi{Hunt for the Wilderpeople}Starring Chris_Hemsworth{In the Heart of the Sea}, Cate_Blanchett{Carol} and\nTom_Hiddleston Kong: Skull Island}Plot_Overview: Imprisoned on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds\nhimself in a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against the Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger. Thors\nquest for survival leads him in a race against time to prevent the omnipotent Hela from destroying his homeworld and the\nAsgardian civilisation.So far, Ive been disappointed by Thors solo outings. The first was average at best and I\nconsider The Dark World to be a quite frankly awful movie. Therefore, I had NO expectations going in and ignored the\noverwhelmingly positive reviews. But after watching it, I loved it. And while I dont agree that its this legendary\ntitan of cinema that some are declaring it as, I certainly think that its a VERY fun and enjoyable way to spend a\ncouple hours of your time. If you like superhero movies, be sure to check it out.What SPECIFICALLY is good about this\nfilm? The drastic change in tone and style is probably by biggest praise. For me, Thors previous outings have been dull\nand monotonous chores to get through so the new focus on comedy was welcome to me. And thankfully a lot of the jokes hit\nbullseyes. I was laughing constantly throughout this movie; it was a genuine COMEDY.The action sequences in this movie\nwere excellent and thoroughly entertaining. They were also, thankfully, well shot; like the rest of this movie. Thor:\nRagnarok is an excellently shot, edited and lit movie. Javier Aguirresarobe does an EXCELLENT job in shooting this\nmovie. Combine this with the jaw dropping effects and 3D and you have one heck of a good looking movie.Chris Hemsworth\nwas an actor I didnt like before. Ive always thought he was very one note and had a limited range. This movie proves\notherwise. Hemsworth does excellent in the action sequences of this movie, but also has an excellent sense of humour and\nfulfils the quota for a couple dramatic moments reasonably well. I commend the man for proving me wrong. Accompanying\nThor is his quirky brother, Loki, as portrayed by Tom Hiddlesticks Hiddlseton. Hiddlesticks was great in Thor, eh in\nAvengers Assemble, okay in Thor: The Dark World and, Im pleased to announce, great in Ragnarok. Hiddlesticks\ndelivers his best performance of the year(screw Skull Island) and returns to form as the extremely charismatic Loki,\nthat we all love to hate. Mark Ruffallo{Avengers Assemble} also co-starred. Granted, he is Hulk for the majority of the\nrun time but for the moments hes not, he does a great job. Expanding on the decision to include Hulk, I liked it. They\ncertainly give Hulk a lot more personality, and make him feel a lot more relevant to the plot, unlike in other movies.\nHulk is now a CHARACTER, no longer a giant green monster that smashes stuff. But dont worry, he is still a good\nsmasher. Tessa Thompson{Selma} also appears in the movie as Valkyrie. Thompson does a reasonable job as this character\nand succeeds in the action segments of the movie. Alas, I dont think she was that good in the more sombre moments, or\nat making jokes. Jeff Goldblum is my spirit animal. I love the man as an actor and I thought he was pitch perfect in\nthis movie. Hes one of the brighter spots of the movie, despite not appearing in it THAT much.As for issues, I\nunfortunately have a couple. Firstly, the story was very weak and the conclusion unsatisfying. The concept of Ragnarok\nis a TERRIFYING idea, especially for the characters on screen. But its not really that important to the plot. In fact,\nits brought up at the start and then once more at the very end. So I dont really see the point in labelling the film\nas it. The actual story that we got was a very dull one. I wasnt expecting much but the story was so meaningless and\npointless that I really wish more time was put into it. Furthermore, I also hated the conclusion of this movie. I was\nvery disappointed about something. The thing I was disappointed about is TECHNICALLY a spoiler so if you have watched\nthe movie, please read on. But if not, then please skip to the next paragraph from now!!!! Right, the thing that I wish\nhappened but did not, was that I wish that Thor_would have been killed off. I know that may seem morbid but its true.\nRagnarok means the end of everything, so what better of a way to have one of the movies that lead into Infinity War,\nhave a main character die. Itd bring stakes back to this universe and give the Avengers something to Avenge. And I\nthink its be an EXCELLENT way to wrap this film, and Thors saga, up.Okay, there are no more spoilers no so feel free\nto read on. My second major issue with this movie is Cate Blanchett and the villain. I understand that Marvels villains\narent typically good, but even by their standards: this was pretty poor. Hela, who is the GODDESS OF DEATH, is the\nvillain of this movie and guess what she does? Sit in corner for the entire movie and contribute NOTHING to the plot.\nThere was no point to her being there. In fact, I believe this film wouldve been better without a villain, and just\nhave it be a buddy comedy. Blanchett wasnt AWFUL as Hela but she wasnt that good. It was a passable\nperformance.Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun and a passable way to end the Thor saga. I definitely recommend you\nwatch. Ill rate it 8 Haircuts out of 10!",

    "reviewTitle": "Easily the best Thor movie!",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint! On the contrary, it actually blew me away. Out of the 3 Thor movies, this is without\ndoubt the best one. Some say the humour is futile and aimed at 12 year olds. Well I am mid-30s and I had some really\ngood laughs throughout the movie. It is cool to see the other Marvel superheroes pop up. If youre like me and not\nreading too much about the films and what characters theyll feature, before going to see them then youll get a nice\nsurprise. Also some new characters are being introduced. Korg is bound to crack you up. Everyone does a good job in this\nfilm though. Loke is still a bit of a scene stealer, but not like in the other films where he rules the roost\ncompletely. 130minutes flew by. As always the CGI is astonishing. And the Valkyries flashback scene is beautiful. Fight\nscenes have you excited! And frankly, any film that opens and closes with Led Zeppelin deserves an extra star! I have no\nproblem giving Thor: Ragnarok 9 out of 10. It is up there with Guardians of the Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised! A great\naddition to the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Ragnarok (2017)",
    "reviewBody": "After actually being quite a fan of the previous Thor movies, I was incredibly excited to hear that Kiwi, Taika Waititi\nwould be directing this as his previous films, Boy, What We Do In The Shadows and Hunt For The Wilderpeople were\njust amazing and incredible works of fiction. This film did not disappoint though it did lack in certain areas.Chris\nHemsworth gives his best performance as Thor Odinson along with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner although I thought we\ncouldve seen more Bruce then Hulk. Tom Hiddleston is living it up as Loki and gives yet another great performance as\nThe God of Mischief.Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban and Idris Elba are all fine members of the supporting cast and I actually\nreally enjoyed Urbans English accent and his character in general. Elba is just badass in every sense of the word.\nAnthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel House, Clancy Brown, Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke\nHemsworth also gave great supporting performances. Props to Taika for bringing in Rachel House his long time friend into\nthis role and she had some great moments.The cameos of Hemsworth, Neill and Damon were just incredible. The humour is\njust sidesplitting and has Taika written all over it. The action was actually very good considering the Directors lack\nof experience and The Valkyrie sequence was just visually stunning. The story was simple and easy to follow, the film\nflowed really well and it was just really really enjoyable.Cate Blanchett was a bit meh for me, she was good but she\njust wasnt very memorable. Tessa Thompson was just boring. Uninspiring and uncharismatic and sadly that was the result\nof the actress not the writer. Some of the effects were a bit naff, they were a bit ragdolly and some shots in Norway\nwere clearly a green screen. But that comes with the inexperience of a big budget with Taika.The biggest con of this\nfilm was what happened to the Warriors Three as they were legitimately some of the best parts of the previous Thor\nfilms. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and especially Tadanobu Asano deserved much more then to be unceremoniously killed\noff with barely putting up a fight. Such a shame, a massive shame.Overall this film is fun, exciting and a really\nenjoyable experience, there are some minor flaws that tarnish the overall film but this is a great addition to the\nMarvel Cinematic Universe and a great boost to brilliant director Taika Waititi.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Movie but for ...",
    "reviewBody": "If I had just gone by the previews, and not been so caught up in the Marvel storyline, I probably would have given this\nmovie a miss. Well, it turned out that it was just Cate Blaunchetts really bad acting (or overacting). It seemed as if\nshe really couldnt play a superhero bad guy, or even sit well in a superhero movie. Sure, she may have won and Oscar or\ntwo, but this role was certainly not Oscar worthy (not that any of the Marvel films ever make it into the Oscar fields\nas it is). In fact her portrayal of Hella was so bad that I literally cringed whenever she opened her mouth.Anyway, the\nfilm begins with Thor in a cage. He has been travelling the galaxy looking for the infinity stones, with little to no\nluck, and is now a prisoner of Surtur, one of the Asgardian bad guys. Anyway, to cut a long story short, and after an\nawesome rendition of The Immigrant Song by Led Zepplin, he defeats Surtur and finally returns to Asgard to discover that\nLoki is up to his old tricks again. Unfortunately this latest trick has resulted in Odins death, and their sister Hella\nbeing set free to rampage over Asgard. Meanwhile Thor and Loki are banished to a trash world where they (or at least\nThor) needs to escape. Along the way he also discovers that The Hulk has also landed up here.This isnt a new story, if\nfact it is one that I have seen time and time again. The hero is banished from his home and a malevolent force takes\nover. The Hero must escape the prison, return to his home, and defeat the bad guy. Sounds simple, well not quite,\nbecause this is Ragnarok, which basically signals the end of Asgard. While the story was old hat, and Blaunchett\nhorrible, the execution was near perfect. Interestingly the director was born in New Zealand, and when he appeared in a\npre-opening scene, I suddenly discovered that he played a minor role in the film (the South Pacific accent stands out a\nmile, at least where Im concerned).Oh, I should also mention the jokes. As one reviewer pointed out these later Marvel\nMovies seem to be really ramping up on the humour, and in part it is starting to ruin them. Some of them are really\ngood, but others of them are forced and unnecessary. In fact a part of it seems to be turning into something like Galaxy\nQuest than a serious science-fantasy superhero movie, which is actually a little disturbing. For instance the name of\nthe singularity that they used to escape from the garbage world was quite unnecessary. Still, it is a pretty good movie,\nbut I do feel that they need to start toning down on the humour a little.",

    "reviewTitle": "Asgard is Dead",
    "reviewBody": "The concept of Ragnarok for a Thor finale was unexpected and amazing especially since the Norse myths on which the event\nis based on and the comic arc is based on were great sources for this movie and I think Taika read exactly none of\nthem.The whole grandiose Ragnarok was the 5 minutes Surtur trashed Asgard.As for the characters:1)Thor:Had some\ndevelopment,learned to work together with people,trust in his power and the responsibility of a leader,after 3 movies he\njust learned that.His attitude towards the whole situation was unnecessary to be honest,most of the times he felt like\nhe either didnt care or was unaware of the real danger.I liked that for once he could stand his own against Hela(for a\nwhile),defeated Hulk and the monsters in Hell and Helas army of the dead.I loved his version of Thorforce(his true\npotential).2)Hulk/Banner:It finally gave the big guy some development,some conciseness,some feelings of his own,it was\ngood to see him caring for his friends and acting like a sentient being for once.It was refreshing to see the man and\nthe beast coming at terms with their mutual need for each other.I dont really understand yet why Banner would disappear\nforever if he ever should turn into Hulk again,which he did.So is Bruce forever gone? 3)Hela:Blanchett by far was the\nbest part of the movie,her stellar performance and her look were amazingly accurate to the comics,she looked convincing\nand acted royal and for once I saw an evil character enjoying her colors and proudly wearing them.Personality wise she\nwas Hela mixed with Angela and Gorr and her powers were mostly drawn from Gorr which while cool was disappointing,her\naction scenes were cut short,her screen time was unfairly small for the one supposed to be THE VILLAIN of the movie and\ndespite all this she was the best developed character in the movie in my mind.The most disappointing thing about her and\nValkyrie was that their epic fight was reduced to a few shots and that was all,not event a small 3 minutes scene.Her\ngetting stabbed or kicked by the asgardians felt weird since she is presented as Odins right hand,not that it damages\nher but looks pretty careless for the general who helped conquer the 9 realms.Also Fenris was reduced to her pet gal\ndog,while nice to see her it was a very stupid decision.Even if her scenes were meaningful,she was super underutilized.\n4)Odin:His death was rushed and I didntt really feel the tragedy in it,his joke about the God of Hammers was good\ntho,I would also like to point out that I liked him giving Thor that extra boost of confidence to let his power loose\nfor once.I also loved seeing his true face,a war hungry powerful being,who along his daughter knelled the 9 realms into\nsubmission but after all,had a limit which made him question Helas sanity and purpose in all that.5)Loki:Arounded\ncharacter since the Avengers,he is in the movie to add to Thors relationship,has a few good jokes and some nice\nmoments.6)Valkyrie:Thessa did an amazing job playing a legendary warrior,hunted by the past who succumbed to alcohol and\nman hunting to bury her pain and loss but it was weird how she was so easily convinced to join the Revengers.I loved her\nsuit and her action sequences. 7)Surtur:2nd best addition to the movie,it was great to see him in the beginning,his\ndesign was superb but even in his weakened state I felt he was defeated too easily.Him being reborn and fulfilling his\ndestiny while facing Hela was pretty epic but short lived,the true meaning of the movie was brought to life by this guy\nand he was at his job for 3 minutes or so.8)Grand Master:The character seemed like a Psychotic ruler of a trashy\nplanet,didntt feel powerful or truly evil,just mad,if that was the intention than bravo to Golblum but I feel the best\nparts that came of the characters like his speech at the end,the talk in the arena,etc were his work and not the\nscript.I liked his way of dressing and how quick he would switch between moods and ironically how he hated violence.\nCGI:Looked very good sometimes like Hela vs Surtur scene,Hela vs the Valkyrior,Thor vs Hulk,everyone vs the army of the\ndead but the scene they changed,where Hela emerged from her prison was bad in terms of effects,they filmed a new\nsequence and then added the old,alley one reaction when she caught the hammer. Soundtrack:It was formidable,especially\nthe Immigrant song added to the biggest action pieces throughout the movie. Landscapes:I was beyond happy with what we\ngot,Skar,Asgard,ruins of the old cemetery below the Throne room,the secret fortress,Hell,Helas prison,Norway,Sanctum\nSanctorum and of course New York. Personal observations:1)Hela as a mix of characters I felt ended up doing more bad for\nher than good,her comic self is so much superior to this mixed bag they did,it ended up being good thanks to Blanchetts\nacting.I was so disappointing we got no throne in Niffelheim but a cheap prison set up by her father,powered by his life\nforce. 2)The Asgard scenes while more meaningful than Skar were too short,very insightful but short. 3)Taikas directing\nwas wrong for this movie,the comedy was good but it needed more seriousness,more cosmic action,more Ragnarok and less\nimprovisation,because not everyone is Goldblum or Blanchett to rock at these things.4)I sure Hope Hela takes over\nDeaths role in MCU and we will get her back,she deserves this,both her and Cate unless they want to waste another Oscar\nactress...",

Some of the action\n scenes to music were very good but just not enough to save the film.\n Thor comes across as more \"Johnny English - bumbling fool\" than\n superhero.

    "reviewTitle": "Thor Ragnarok has the dumb, colourful bombastic fun cinema sorely needs right now.",
    "reviewBody": "Thor Ragnarok is an absolute ball of a film: its the MCUs most enjoyable film since the first Guardians of the Galaxy\nfilm, and doesnt focus too much on sequel building like previous MCU films. Ragnarok is the kind of film that will\nappeal to even the most ardently cynical critics of superhero movies; its stupid but it relishes in its self-aware\nsense of joy and fun.Ragnarok is eons ahead of Thor: The Dark World in my eyes, and is even better than the first Thor.\nIts one of those rare threequels thats better than the films which came before it. And considering how supposedly\nformulaic people are starting to perceive the MCU films, thats saying a lot of great stuff about this movie. Thor:\nRagnarok has the mythological scale of something like The Lord of the Rings, the over-the-top fun of Richard Donners\nSuperman movies, and the extra sprinkling of The Hulk in a gladiator costume to top all this insanity off in a perfectly\ngorgeous combo. Oh, and it accomplishes the other-world-liness of films like The Star Wars Trilogy.Thor: Ragnarok is the\nThor film Ive been waiting for easily. It uses the character in a way that we unfortunately had to wait several films\nfor to justify this payoff, but I promise you the payoff is surprisingly satisfying.",

The film was hilarious and makes this action packed film seem like a great 90s comedy, the one where you\nlaugh at funny jokes and not silly skits or genital reference. The film had really awesome colors and amazing\ncinematography.The acting in the film was for most part great, few exceptions can be listed, and there were few moments\nwhere you can see actor trying to stay in character and they are trying to not to laugh, but it can be excused as 80% of\ndialogue was improvised, and i guess its just natural reaction of people laughing at something. One of the funniest\nthings of the film was definitely the director, the amazing great job he did directing, as well as his hilarious\ncharacter Korg and that funny Kiwi accent that makes you laugh every time he spoke.Like I wrote at the start, this is\nhow comic movies should be made.",

    "reviewTitle": "The God of Thunder-ous Laughter.",
    "reviewBody": "Let me get this out of my system, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the most fun I had at the movies in 2017. Its one of those\nmovies that had everything. Action? Check. Comedy? Check. Amazing VFX? Check. Hulk being a God-smashing maniac?\nDouble-check. This is definitely the best out of the Thor series. The two previous ones were just generic superhero\nmovies. They werent bad, they were pretty good. But as soon as you left the theater, you wont be thinking about it\nanymore.This one, however, wasnt generic. It was different. We were used to seeing Thor as this almighty God with a\nhammer that nobody can lift. And thats pretty much it. To be honest, I never cared much about Thor. He just wasnt that\ninteresting. But this movie drew sort of a parody of his image and it was really fun to watch. And lets not forget\nabout the Hulk. He is so lovable in this movie. How do you even make a person want to cuddle a 10-foot green\nabomination? You got to be a genius or some kind. Marvel appointed Taika Waititi to direct this movie. An indie darling\nfrom New Zealand that made comedy hits like What We Do in the Shadows, Eagle vs. Shark, and most recently, The Hunt for\nthe Wilderpeople. They all have this unique dry humor that I adore very much. And he brought his signature style again\nfor this movie. I respect this move by Marvel because a lot of studios are afraid of trying new things. A lot of\ndirectors were left with minimal creative decisions when it comes to big blockbusters. One of the case was the Fantastic\nFour reboot by Fox, two years ago. Josh Trank was so frustrated at Foxs dominating involvement in his project that he\neventually took his frustration to the social media. Marvel dont want this to happen. They bravely take the risk of\ngiving directors creative decisions. Though sometimes it could result to a mixed bag like Iron Man 3, it could also be a\nsmashing hit like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok.In the end, this movie is a total blast from start to end.\nIt may be different than the other Marvel movies, but I swear there is nothing to regret. Whatever this movie lacks in\ndramatic aspects, it makes up in its comedy and fun characters along the way. And by today, I know that Thor isnt on my\nTop 2 Most Boring Avenger list anymore. Though Hawkeye is definitely still there. Make the poor guy relevant Marvel,\njeez.",

The villain Hela is also great in the movie and recreation rally\nadds to movie as a whole whole also adding to list list of great casting choices by Marvel. To summarize Thor Ragnarok\nis Marvels best Thor movie to date with its dry humour and its weird and wacky tones.",

    "reviewTitle": "Hell Yeah!! Good Job Marvel",
    "reviewBody": "This movie was a really solid one. It was really funny and and just lots of fun. I didnt like the first 2 Thor movies\nthat much and this is obviously the best one so far and probably one of the best mcu movies. Taika Waititi did a really\ngood job both directing and voicing the funniest character in mcu history probably. His character Korg was probably the\nfunniest character in the movie, his lines were hilarious,he had the funniest accent ever probably. And all the\ncharacters were really good. Hela is probably my favorite mcu villain right now. Cate Blanchett is really good in this\nmovie, she is really sexy, funny and intimidating and her little fight with the Asgardians was really fun and cool.\nChris Hemsworth was also really good in this he was really funny and had more character to him compared to the other\nThor movies. Jeff Goldblum was awesome in the movie. Karl Urban was really good (I couldnt realize him in his\ncharacter). Tessa Thompson was great. Tom Hiddleston, Mark Rufallo and Idris Elba were great as always. This movie had a\nbasic plot and story that was just fun. Also this movie was visually stunning (not BR2049 stunning but very pleasing in\nthat regard. Had really cool set pieces and action. Soundtrack was also really pleasing with its synth wave-y 80s feel\nand pretty much the whole movie had the 80s feel with neon color usage. I dont have much problems with it and I\ndefinitely would recommend seeing this movie if you have the time.",

It is closer to a comedy infused movie like the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" than it is\nto the first Thor movie witch I really liked. And while the movie made me smile a few times, I cant help but thinking:\nis this what the viewers want these days? To see distant, magical worlds on the screen, and magical, eternal, godlike\nbeings acting and making jokes like in some sitcom like \"Will  Grace\" and \"Friends\"? If the answer is \"yes\" then you\nwill enjoy this movie.",

    "reviewBody": "To be honest, I really satisfied after watching this movie because it is really fun, funny, and brings joy to the\naudience. They succeed again at making superhero movie with comedy style like Deadpool or Guardian of Galaxy. The jokes\nare good, and with experienced and well known actor like Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Rufallo, and Idris Elba\nmake this movie even better !Marvel did the right decision to make this movie into comedy, because it makes this movie a\nlot more fresh and interesting to watch. Many people can enjoy this film and will make you feel happy till the end of\nthe day !But, I think at some point Thor Ragnarok is lacking many of important point. The plot seems decent with nothing\nspecial in the story, lacking some emotional touch and too many CGI effect involved sometimes make the movie kinda too\nunrealistic. And I feel a little disappointed with nothing special involved Loki. Loki is somehow that makes Thor movie\nand Avenger movie more interesting, with his sneaky tricky style sometimes pick a good side or bad side. At last, with\nthe title Ragnarok that means the big war that can brings doom, I expect they can make this movie much better, not only\nsome funny comedy movie !",

    "reviewBody": "When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber\ntake, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the\nfew and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for\nconquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation\nwith his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, theyre stuck in\nSakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the\nnext). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion \" The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the\nroles vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos \" albeit not far enough. It doesnt extend to properly exploring what\nhes been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was\nliterally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The\nsupporting players are appreciated, though).This trilogy has gotten a lot of criticism from the onset, some of it\ndeserved, a lot of it borne out of the natural difficulties with making this kind of world work, especially within the\ngritty, realistic one Iron Man set up. In this entry, Earth is nearly completely absent, and certainly the only human\nwho has screen-time is Dr. Strange, who is also \"beyond\". Yes, Jane Foster, Darcy and Erik Selvig are gone. Broken up\noff-screen. I hate that. However, with this newfound freedom, this goes full cosmic. The tone approaches Guardians of\nthe Galaxy. Its superior to Vol. 2, but not up to the level of the original. Honestly, a few minor things seem to be\nthere specifically to redo that, and theyd be better left on the cutting room floor. The jokey subversion/drama mix is\nnot as strong as that, nor of the third Robert Downey Jr. solo picture. With that said, relatively little of the actual\nweight is lost to laughs. This still has gravity and tension. The action is fast, frequent and enjoyable, if also by far\nthe most MCU aspect of this. Many will find this to be bland, not fun, a corporate product. Certainly, theres still a\nlot of room for diversity and flavor. Fingers crossed that Black Panther will push the envelope there.I recommend this\nto anyone who finds the trailers appealing. You can go into this completely blind. Stay through the credits. 8/10",

    "reviewTitle": "RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?",
    "reviewBody": "There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What\nI mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didnt have the maturity required, both\nbecause of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark\nKnight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.Thor: Ragnarok couldve taken\nitself seriously in the good way, but rather than doing that, it didnt take itself seriously at all, unnecessarily so,\nand ended up becoming a good thing still, but in a bad way. Its weird and begs the question(s); Is Marvel bending to\nits fans will, or is Marvel forcing its fans to bend to its will? Is Marvel being smart and trying to revolutionize\nComic Book Cinema, or stupid, and completely losing the plot?Tension is one of storytellings best and greatest tools,\nand Marvel seems to be slowly abandoning it, for another great tool, humour. However, is this Marvels doing, or is it\nthe fans/critics/audience? Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Serious, dark and amazing = $714 Million Box Office, 89%\nfrom critics and 7.8 IMDb. Guardians of the Galaxy: Colourful, silly, funny = $773 Million Box Office, 91% from critics\nand 8.1 IMDb. GotG beat TWS (even though TWS is a sequel, and sequels tend to do more, and, our first look at Steve\nafter The Avengers) in every way according to numbers, but was GotG actually the better film? Batman Begins, Captain\nAmerica: The First Avenger, Man of Steel and X-Men: First Class suffered similar fates.I love dark, serious, tense.\nRagnarok is not that for the most part, but its still a good watch. There is a lot that is good about this movie, like\nThor and Lokis moment in the elevator, but there is also a lot that is bad too, like the fact that for 4 years weve\nwondered how Thor would react to Lokis impersonation/imprisonment of Odin, and what we got left much to be desired.I\nthink Ragnarok took a very different approach here, and, because of Marvels appeal and reach, it maybe shaking something\nloose. Also, they could afford to take this route with Thor, as it is the least received franchise, so, they perhaps\ndidnt have much to lose, and more/everything to gain.Ragnarok being this \"light\" also, could work very well for\nInfinity War, as long as IW is \"hella\" dark. The contrast maybe a very welcomed surprise.I will say this though, if\nInfinity War takes Ragnaroks path, it will undoubtedly, dismantle its opportunity of being a legendary classic, that\nhas been 11 years and 18 movies in the making.Personally I think that at this point, it may be difficult to judge any\nMCU film by itself, because each installment is now telling the stories of something bigger, so when you factor that in,\nthere maybe more to what meets the eye.Anyway, in the spirit of judging each on its own merit, Thor: Ragnarok; 7/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Crazy colorful space warrior adventure on the big screen,",
    "reviewBody": "The movie is great. Its a new experience. It does have deep flaws that affected my experience though, but a good\nenjoyable fresh movie overall.The movie will be a pretty fresh experience. 80 percent of it its outer worlds adventure\nextravaganza. The planets and designs are incredible. The story is pretty cool too. But...My problem with it its not\nwhat some people have pointed out: The movie is way more of a comedy than the previous two. Its just that Taika Waititi\ndidnt care about taking the plot seriously at all, like in purpose. You dont need to have a loose plot to be hilarious\nand a comedy masterpiece, look at the first Hangover, look at how high the stakes were in that movie. This movie jumps\nfrom point a to b without any regard on how or why, a clear example of this is the Hulk. I have expected since Age of\nUltron for marvel to answer how Hulk left for another planet and the answer is \"He just did\"? This is true for all the\nplot points in the movie. This is just the sort of thing the Russos would have polished completely while keeping all the\njokes.I thought the story was full of missed opportunities (Fan Fic incoming, skip if you hate Fan Fic mindsets) why not\nhave the hammer be a limitation of Thors true power created by Odin to limit him so what happened to Hela becoming evil\nand unstoppable never happens to him. Making not only Thors unlocking of his true potential logical but also symbolical\nnow that he lives in a world where his father, the most powerful man wont be there to protect his world. The Thor Hulk\nfight was cool as hell, even if it was a little simple, it looked incredible. They gave it a definitive space pay per\nview filter or something. It looked awesome. Hela was cool as well. AND HEREs my biggest defense for the whole movie:\nThor himself was great. It felt Waititi designed the whole process of the movie on getting who Chris Hemsworth is, how\n(Chris Hemsworth) HE sees Thor not how Kevin Feige or Marvel or we the fans have told him to act. How he could actually\nconnect with a Thor he was frankly disconnected from more and more. And I think in this aspect for what the movie is,\nthey had a freaking home run. Hemsworth is fresh again and better than ever. He is awesome, he is Thor and he enjoys it.\nIt feels more like a psychological acting directorial procedure milestone more than a movie merit. But directors should\nlook at whatever Waititi did, because he might have unlocked Chris Hemsworth potential to be awesome to watch on camera.\nThere you have something I can not stop giving props to. So yeah objectively a 7/10 but I would re watch this a thousand\ntimes over the 2 previous ones. Also I can not give enough merit on how this movie readjusted Thor incredibly well\nwithout him feeling at all like a new character or forced in any way. Its just great overall.I would like to see him in\nother movies. He could have a serious role in a war movie or a criminal thriller. Hemsworth rocked, and Loki as much as\nI hated him in the past due to his popularity is freaking incredible as he has always been.",

    "reviewBody": "I just got home from Thor: Rganarock and boy, it was a fun movie. I am really happy that they went in a different\ndirection with comedy rather then with the boring suffering and seriousness of Thor 1 and 2.Thor has short hair which\nworks, mjollnir getting destroyed does not affect the story, and maybe will be a future objective for Thor to restore it\nin upcoming movies.They made the Hulk talk which is awesome, this also makes him have a personality and he becomes quite\nlikable.Cate Blanchett is amazing as usual, also heads up for Idris Elba and Tom as usual, he being regarded as a fan\nfavorite.As I mentioned there is a lot of comedy, but its not overused and this time it actually works, Guardians of the\nGalaxy 1 style, which gives a great tone to the movie.The end is maybe a little confusing, where Asgard is being\ndestroyed. I mean Thor cant defeat Hela, but the fire monster can, but Thor at the beginning of the movie destroyed the\nfire monster ? Maybe cuz he had Mjollnir ? Whatever. I reckon they needed to destroy somehow Asgard to move the story\nforward, but they could have done it in a different way.Also very good visuals all around, but heads up for the\nscavenger trash planet looks absolutely amazing, they they made it look really sci-fi looking, the city, spaceships etc,\nlike something you would see maybe in star wars, or blade-runner, well not actually but sort of, which is kinda good.The\naction is very good, the story is simple so there is not much not to like.All in all a very good viewing, if you like\nhumour, good action go and see it.I give it a 9/10.",

None\nof the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which\nwere getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. I cant even begin to describe the\ndisappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed\neverything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I\nwould like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate\ndoom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making\nfools out of themselves made it even worse. If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might\nbe fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch\nInfinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant\nattempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and\ndistractions instead of a good story and directing.",

So many cheap laughs, it was almost like a spoof more than the real thing. I got\nthe feeling from the clip on Youtube of \"Team Thor\".The characters lack depth because of all the humor and I feel like\nMarvel are redirecting its movies to fit a younger audience. I feel like the volume of comic relief is what keeps this\nfilm from being a great one, just like Guardians Vol.2.The movie is enjoyable, bright, fun, colorful and with an awesome\nsoundtrack. If you like that kind of movie this is the one for you!

    "reviewBody": "Have to say right away that this was good. The third solo outing for Thor sees him stranded on an alien planet and\nforced to fight in a contest of champions organised by The Grand Master (Jeff Goldblum - kooky and funny as ever). With\nAsgard in danger of being conquered by his older sister Hela, the Goddess of Death (Cate Blanchett), Thor must find a\nway to escape and rescue his fellow Asgardians. This might prove a bit difficult as his opponent in his first contest\nis....The Incredible Hulk.Ive skipped a lot of plot here to avoid too many spoilers. Quite frankly the story is all\nover the place, being mainly an excuse for a string of jokes and wise-cracking. Some of these dont work, but most do.\nChris Hemsworth has never been better as Thor, and hes well supported by the usual suspects. No Lady Sif, though. No\nmention of her at all.Standouts for me were Goldblum and Tessa Thompson, who adds a bit of spice as a drunken\nex-Valkyrie. Blanchett is a very good villain, but somewhat underused. Still better than Malekith any day,\nthough.Basically Marvel have delivered three out and out comedies this year. Hopefully Black Panther and Infinity War\nwill restore some semblance of depth, as the movie is very shallow. This does have some serious plot points, but its\nglossed over in favour of the next one-liner.Sleek, entertaining; check your brain in. Now its time for Marvel to get\nserious.",

Everything in this movie\nbecomes glitterous and stupidly irritating, transforming the atmosphere into an Action movie where you need to make the\nspectator laugh with any kind of joke, taking away the little credibility left to the Thor package. Once my position was\nclarified on this point, I would like to say that the actors seemed compelling and the special effects perfect without\nany banging. The plot that has been developed has no big flaws even though its too trivial, even for a Marvel movie.

    "reviewBody": "Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series\"generally the\nleast liked within the MCU\"it wouldnt be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It\ndoesnt, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand\ndirector Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititis comedy background is noticeably\nin full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy \"\nthe movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCUs funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side\ncharacter made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchises best one-liner\nsince Chris Pratts Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and\ntheres plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising\ngladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the\nbreathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s\natmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelins\nImmigrant Song, for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho\nGod of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela,\nTessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome\ncameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting\ncharacters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesnt quite work, and the narrative-retcon work\ncouldve been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably\ntaking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering\nof the highest order.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor goes wild in this 80s infused superhero comedy",
    "reviewBody": "Its hard to know how Thor acolytes will feel about the God of Thunders latest solo adventure, with New Zealand\ndirector Taika Waititi turning the previous Shakespearian meets modern day blockbuster like first two outings on their\nheads with his laughter focused/80s infused action comedy that is likely to appeal to a broader audience while also\nalienating some hard-core fans in the process.Its not like Thor from 2011 and Dark World from 2013 are exactly overly\nwell-loved properties, Thor the character finding a broader appeal and resonance in the Avenger films, but Waititis\ndeparture from what has come before is one of the greatest change of paces for a series Ive ever seen.Gathering a\npassionate if small fan base from his work directing films Boy, What We Do in the Shadows and the critical smash Hunt\nfor the Wilderpeople, those that have adored Waititis work on a small budget will be pleased to know his oddball sense\nof humour and playful directing is still well and truly in-tact with a Marvel budget behind his every wish and\nimaginative idea.Barely taking a chance to catch a breath over 2 hours of runtime, Waititi throws the audience headfirst\ninto Thors newest life or death outing as the muscled god with a freshly minted haircut (courtesy of a particularly\nexcited hairdresser) finds himself trying to escape Sakaar, a planet run by Jeff Goldblums camp Grandmaster all the\nwhile dealing with his dastardly adopted brother Loki, his angry green friend Hulk/Bruce Banner and most pressingly Cate\nBlanchetts new villainess Hela, who has taken over Thors home world of Asgard.Its a multi-stranded plot line but its\nall there as an excuse and fodder for Waititi to showcase a new side of Thor whose grown into himself and learnt more\nabout the universe from his time on Earth, as well as a reason to team Hemsworth with Mark Ruffaloos Hulk as the two\nshare a great on screen chemistry as mismatched friends.As to be expected with a Waititi film, the characters and humour\nare what makes his features resonate with audiences around the world and he gifts Hemsworth his best take on Thor yet\nwhile newcomers to the series Tessa Thompson as feisty warrior and likely fan favourite Valkyrie, Waitit himself doing\nthe voice of rock fighter Korg, Goldblum as Grandmaster and Blanchett as lead antagonist Hela all fair well, clearly\nhaving a blast with Waititis wacky and often inventive situations and executions.As fun and visually captivating as\nmost of Waititis movie is, Ragnarok still struggles to bring the narrative arc of the story full circle and with\nWaititi still undoubtedly needing to mould his film into what lays ahead for the Marvel universe, as a whole the final\nsection of the film suffers from a rather forgettable and bland finishing act that feels incredibly lacklustre to what\nhas come before it.Caught up also with the arc of Thor being on Sakaar, Waititi struggles to make the most of\nBlanchetts Hela and her whole period on Asgard never really gets out of first gear and it becomes an arguable statement\nthat perhaps Waititi took on board to much at once and sections of the film feel the pressure from so many things going\non at once.Final Say \" Ragnarok is Thor gone wild, a film thats an over the top colourful mash-up of 80s stylings,\naction tics while on a constant search for the next punch-line.A Marvel experience that will once more light up the\ninternational box office and become a quick-fire audience favourite, theres not a lot of lasting appeal to Waititis\nfilm other than the likelihood of it being a guilty pleasure of the Marvel film series but its one of the years\nsilliest and sensory overloading blockbusters that provides a great bang for your buck adventure and more laughs in a\nsingle scene than most mainstream comedies could conjure up in an entire runtime.3  eager hairdressers out of 5",

    "reviewTitle": "A very fun movie that sheds new light on the future direction of the MCU",
    "reviewBody": "I think that this newest installment in the MCU, Thor:Ragnarok truly solidifies the MCUs new direction that has been\ncommencing in phase 3. Contrary to the previous Marvel Phases this new Phase focuses on a new direction, in Phase 1 we\nhad the origin stories which came together in the first Avengers movie. In Phase 2 we got some further world building in\nthe different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But, other than these entries\nMarvels Phase 2 also gave us some experimental projects like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Now in Phase 3 this\nexperimental Marvel is coming in full force. In order for a franchise like Marvel to survive I think this new direction\nis very important if not necessary, it is very interesting that Marvel is now employing directors that are not\nnecessarily the usual big budget movie directors but rather, directors of low budget movies such as Taika Waititi.\nMarvel Phase 3 seems to be all about having this ensemble of films with drastically different tones. Weve had 2\ncomedies Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians 2. But weve also went into mystical/fantasy genres in Doctor Strange or serious\ndramas like Civil War. Not to mention the coming Black Panther that has a very estranged setting. All this is what the\nNew Marvel has become and I think it is perfect. So, after discussing so much on the direction of the MCu I would like\nto pull the focus back to Thor: ragnarok, I can understand that many people did not like this film for its lack of\nsignificance in the greater scene/setting of the MCU. In fact there wasnt much stakes that carry through to the MCU and\nit seems very self contained. However I think that it is important to enjoy this movie as it is, the fun action sci-fi\nthat is probably the funniest Marvel movie to date. The thing is we as audiences get so much superhero movies nowadays\nthere is a case of superhero film fatigue and having large stakes in every single movie is just going to dilute out\ntastes. This current way, we can enjoy these characters in their own side stories/adventures and enjoy the big explosive\nmoments when they come together, like a comic book crossover event! What Thor: Ragnarok does so well is that it really\nredefines the Thor franchise, the character of Thor himself and even the Hulk character. All the while maintaining the\nsense of fun and adventure. I did enjoy that they further characterized Hulk so he isnt just a raging monster but a\nsimple minded character who has more complexity than is previously perceived. However, the comedy does come at the\nexpense of certain climactic battle sequences and serious moments and this is sure to put certain audiences off. But\noverall, a thrilling, fun action movie that is sure to evoke certain controversies.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply epic",
    "reviewBody": "Well for what its worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this years MCU\nmovies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didnt like\nabout Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good.\nIts explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You\ndecide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the\nGalaxy and while I dont fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the\nGuardians movies, but certainly not in a bad way.What makes this film so good is its associates. Theyre not out of\nplace and theyre not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for\nexample. I was thinking, \"Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite.\" Well,\noverall, I think its a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather\nthan Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalos Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include\nis its humor. Some say its either a little forced or its just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were\nfunny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, \"Ehh.. okay\", but\nfor the most part, theres some solid laughs here and there.Jeff Goldblums role was unique, to say the least - but did\nkind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I dont know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you\nknow. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say hes pretty good. Hes not amazing, but hes an\ninteresting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood\nout to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor\ntogether. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is\nsuperb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest\nchoice.Theres also a very good cameo like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesnt lose\nits identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, its first and foremost a Thor\nfilm.Heres what I didnt like (or, who I didnt like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character\nare pretty much simplistic and generic, but theyre not invalid by any means- shes annoying. Shes boring. Thats\nreally all I can say. I mean, theres a scene in which I do love that includes her, but its spoiler-ish, so maybe\nanother time...Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the\nthird act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy\nVol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier,\n2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and its one of this\nyears best.8.5/10",

Could be considered a good or bad thing but I liked it. Furthermore\nsome minor characters like Heimdall are expanded upon, which is great because I really enjoy his character. However you\nneed to be a marvel fan to understand some scenes, dont watch this if it is your first as you may be confused. It moves\nquite fast in the beginning but gradually the pace gets a bit better. Overall I would hold this in high regard, just\nunder Captain America: civil war and The Avengers.",

    "reviewTitle": "Packed with Marvel references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute blast!",
    "reviewBody": "After a total of seventeen films in less than ten years, its pretty safe to say that Marvel has safely established\nitself as a popular, successful franchise with its own identity. Known for comedy, references to its other films and\ncomics, and epic, fun action, every Marvel film is at least enjoyable. However, there are some that peak; some that can\nbe included in the best Marvel films - and sometimes best films in the superhero genre. Films like this are the first\nAvengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy - and also Thor: Ragnarok. Definitely a highlight so\nfar in the Marvel anthology, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best, delivering everything you want and expect with a little\nbit more, brimming with fun, personality and action.Anyone whos seen director Taika Waititis vampire-comedy\nmockumentary What We Do in the Shadows will likely expect his inimitable and delightful brand of humour to extend to his\nMarvel entry (perhaps theyve learned since getting rid of Edgar Wright from Ant-Man). Its fortunate that he kept his\ncomedy as it really delivers and fits in well with the comedic personality that Marvel has crafted itself; some of their\nbest films are also, by no coincidence, also the funniest (something DC fails with) and Waititi has continued this\ntrend, while keeping the laughs fresh and genuinely funny. Not that this is a out-and-out comedy - not all the jokes are\nintended to make you laugh out loud; but they never feel forced and all lend themselves to the personality of the film\n(and the franchise) and really maximise the fun we have watching the movie. After all, this is a film about a\ntraditional Norse God as a superhero fighting alongside a big, angry, green rage monster - its important to have fun\nwith it!Fun is certainly one of the best words to describe Thor: Ragnarok and it doesnt extend to just the laughs.\nOther enjoyable elements include references to the wider MCU to excite geeks and non-geeks alike. They all fit in well\nand seamlessly, not a shoehorned, forced reference or cameo; they all seem organic and make sense to the plot. Its\ndelightful to see Dr Strange, even just for one scene, and to be able to spy glimpses of the Tesseract and a fake\nInfinity Gauntlet. These add to the rewatch value in a few years time.The crazy, kinetic action really does extend to\nthe whole of the film, from beginning to end, each sequence excellently choreographed. It doesnt shy away from its\nroots from comics as some of the fights are just as delightfully eccentric and over-the- top. Still they never cease to\nentertain and, more than that, some are just stunning to behold; the flashback to Valkyrie battling Hela the first time,\nher army atop a hoard of winged horses soaring through an orange sky only to be cut down by swords and spikes flying\ntowards them in slow- motion. These are gorgeous scenes and Waititi and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe should be\nproud; the beauty of some of Zack Snyders superhero moments, but in a good film with much more personality.Most of this\nmovies joy lies in its characters though; at the end of the day, it might be funny and the action might look cool, but\nif we dont love the characters, we wont love the film. Back again we get the usual ensemble of returning characters -\nThor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall. All are as regal, fun and charismatic as ever, Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular;\nits wonderful to see these actors develop their characters over the last few films into lovable parts in a franchise\nfull of heroes we already love. I feel Hopkins deserved a little more screen time and a chance to get more emotional,\nbut, ever the professional, he makes the most with what he has (and is exceptionally good as Loki pretending to be\nOdin). Returning characters from elsewhere in the MCU Dr Strange and Hulk also add to the delightful ensemble; its nice\nto see Strange solidifying his presence in the franchise after just one film (particularly when comparing to Tony Stark\nhaving been in six so far, not including post-credit cameos). Its a relief too to finally give Hulk a decent amount of\nscreen time and for us to get to know him as opposed to just Banner; theyre two distinct characters within each other\nand its about time we get to see more of everyones favourite rage monster.The new characters introduced in this film\nare all excellent worthy additions to the Marvel roster and bring a refreshing touch with them. Tessa Thompson is\nexcellent and charismatic as kick-ass female hero Valkyrie, able to confidently stand among Thor, Hulk and Loki. Korg\nmay not be quite the same character he is in the comics, but Waititi takes this part (who wouldnt give themselves a\nminor role in the MCU if they can?!) and really makes it his own, saving lots of the quirky laughs for himself. Cate\nBlanchett too is a particularly fantastic villain, sure to stand amongst the best Marvel villains so far, heads and\nshoulders above the likes of Malekith and Ronan. Shes less generic, less monologue-y and never boring; able to kick ass\nand be just as evilly sexy as Helena Bonham-Carter was as Bellatrix (or is that just me...?). And of course theres Jeff\nGoldblum whos as Jeff Goldblum as hes ever been - who doesnt love that?!Thor proves himself to be the God of Thunder\nand Thor: Ragnarok proves itself to be one of the Gods of Marvel, standing proud amongst the best so far. The whole\nmovies an absolute blast, packed with references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies. An\nexcellent film to round off Marvel in 2017 - lets hope Black Panther keeps up this level of excellence.",

I just cant pass the fact that images seems to small, spacecraft that\nlooks like flies, people that looks like dummies for being so small on screen and jump straight to looking normal\nsize...anyway those are technicalities.Now to the movie - Am I wrong or is this using the same soundtrack as DCs\nLeague? Works! Great sound editing great soundtrack that fits the mightiness of Thor. As always not a lot of swirl\naround the story line, that continues to be for me one key ingredient for the success Marvel Studies have been gaining\nwith its movies when comparing to the DC Universe. Simple, straight to the point and straight to the action (after all I\ndont believe people going to watch super-heroes movies are expecting reality) - so the key is then entertainment. And\nMarvel does this well. It treats super heroes movies like comic books with motion. Thats it.The action is good - (again\n3D damages some of it) - The Lord of thunder is awesome the special effects plus the sound mix - makes it really\nentertaining. Kate Blanchet - how do they do it? If being a goddess of death is this hot...nice refreshing act from\nher... on less common note that the one shes known mostly for...A Hulk that have conversations? straight funny.\nValkyrie, nicely played, Loki always entertaining and one Idris Elba that is simply convincing as the one that sees it\nall...Apart of the 3D, if one thing I would like more - Hulk and Thor fight.It feels this is not the last stance - so\nlooking forward for the next one... if possible 3dless.",

    "reviewBody": "To say Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is best of the three solo Thor films, which it almost certainly is despite its tonal\ndifferences, may be faint praise but its praise nevertheless. This generally entertaining, if somewhat messy piece,\ngets better once its plot is properly underway, which sadly takes around half of its runtime. At this point, the new\ncomedic approach meshes with the pseudo sci-fi aesthetics to create a truly distinct entry in the MCU. Though this\nunique approach isnt entirely successfully and is occasionally feels a little at odds with the core characters, it\nultimately makes the piece a lot more fun than it likely otherwise would have been. It doesnt quite manage to hit all\nof its emotional beats, but it does manage to keep you entertained (again, much more in its second half) and is actually\na lot more plot-focused than you may expect. It typically does a good job with its characters, although the villainess\nis a little weak, and is often genuinely enjoyable. Its funny at times, too. The first half is a bit of a slog, though,\nand the end result isnt as compelling or affecting as youd hope. Still, it will probably satisfy disillusioned Thor\nfans, so long as they dont mind changing his DNA a little; its certainly better than either of his previous two\noutings. 6/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Good fun but lacks depth",
    "reviewBody": "As a fan of Taika Waititi I was very excited to see him at the helm of an MCU movie, especially a Thor film the\ncharacter I have always felt was the weakest Avenger and the one that nobody seemed to know which direction to take in.\nWaititi fixed this issue and all of a sudden made Thor a more likable and interesting character, Chris Hemsworth\nproviding a hilarious and brilliant performance like the rest of the cast. The comedy created a jovial atmosphere that\nis not present in most marvel films and this alongside the vibrant use of colour in the film appears to mark a turning\npoint in the MCU.However I couldnt help but feel slightly disappointed by this film. Firstly Cate Blanchett was\nexcellent as Hela, proving to be one of the best villain the MCU has to offer, however she was slightly underused. Also\nthe film lacked depth, almost trying too hard to be humorous in certain places instead of focusing on backstories or\ncharacters emotions which may have been more effective. Whilst the upbeat, fun of the film was welcome it felt wrong\nduring particular moments that involved the planet Hulk story line, a fantastic more serious story. It was a shame that\nsuch a rich story was merely brushed over. Furthermore, Taikia Waititi may need to work more on producing grand, large\nscale films because, even though the his personal touches were nice, for a film about Ragnarok (the end of everything)\nit felt very small and didnt occupy the grandeur it possibly deserved. Also maybe just because I love Taikai Watitis\nstyle of comedy I went in expecting more humour similar to that of the character Korg (played by Waititi) however that\nis just personal preference.Overall this is a fun, enjoyable and visually epic (except on some of the occasions when\ngreen screen was used ) film, but for everything good about it there is an equal number of problems with it.",

    "reviewBody": "Men the missus were looking forward to seeing Thor: Ragnarok. Wed seen the shorts and were impressed. So off we hopped\nto see it in a manner that holders of the Holy Seniors Card grandly imagine to be nimble. It was made in Australia\nand has Australians in it and some New Zealanders too who arent yet famous enough to be claimed as Australians.Odin,\nThors dad has flown the coop and left Asgard to live in Norway and look at the ocean. Thor, and his brother Loki the\nDodgy, go to visit him via Dr Strange in a bit that I didnt quite understand. Loki, I discovered is/was Taylor Swifts\nsqueeze! Thanks, Doctors waiting room magazines! Next visit Ill try and find out who Taylor Swift is.Odin tells the\nThorster that he isnt really the firstborn and he has a big sister and she has been hidden away because she is\ntemperamentally questionable, in the manner of a youth who might feature in the first episode of a Kids who Commit\nGenocide documentary series is temperamentally questionable. Not only is she super-mean, but shes really REALLY strong\nand has no need of a hammer; she has attitude! She is called Hela but is really darkside Galadriel who has covered her\nears up. Being the firstborn she has dibs on the throne.Thor ends up in a sort of fighting pit run by Wilderpeople and\nJurassic Parkers. I didnt really understand how he got there except there was a drunk chick involved. Doesnt really\nmatter, but. It was pretty funny. Thor meets Korg who is a gladiatorial support act made out discarded drystone and is\none of my favouritest characters. They become friends. Thor takes his shirt off and there was a sharp intake of breath\nfrom the female audience members, as well as the two blokes sitting behind us. He also gets a haircut.Thor fights the\nHulk in the fighting pit. How the Hulk got there isnt explained but it doesnt really matter. Its a good fight too! I\nwant to know who makes the Hulks trouser because I too have gotten heaps bigger over time and a pair of expanda-pants\nwould be handy.There is a sort of alliance formed and they all head off to Asgard to take care of Darkside\nGaladriel/Hela. Its not going to be easy. Making up a name for the alliance is tricky too.There is a big battle and\nImmigrant Song is played. I still think it should be our national anthem. I grandly consider myself a visionary, and\nas such it is my lot to have my great ideas ignored. I wont ruin it by telling who wins.Is it any good? YessirreeeBob.\nIts directed by the same person who directed Hunt for the Wilderpeople and that is a fave. Hes a New Zealander at\nthe moment but well adopt him soon. Its good enough that Ill prolly buy it on Blu-ray and take it away on golf trips\nto entertain the drunks.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvels most audacious film to date.... and it pays off",
    "reviewBody": "Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvels most audacious film in their\ncinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and\nentertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor\nis pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititis trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish.\nHowever, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot\nof the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and\nvisuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth\nhas embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more\ncompelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent\nHela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her\nhead- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-\"thats what heroes do\". The \"Revengers\" as he names them includes\nthe Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), \"his friend from work\", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki\n(Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an\nappearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of\ncracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititis style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident\nthat everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why\nThor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.",

    "reviewTitle": "Blackwashing, too many jokes, but very funny okayish movie",
    "reviewBody": "Not sure what to say or think about this movie. It is hilariously fun, and the jokes are well woven into the narrative,\nthe acting great, the action amazing. In almost every aspect this is the perfect action-y superhero movie, but I still\ndo not like it... Out of all the Thor movies, this is probably my least favorite, and that is saying something. The\nreason? Well, the blackwashing for one. Again we see Hollywood destroy a great character only because they want to get\nrid of white people. It is racism, and that racist idea of exchanging white characters with black ones leave a bad taste\nin my mouth. Secondly there are way, way too many jokes in here. And worse: they joke when people are dying. Oh, a\nplanet is destroyed and millions are dying? Well, let us joke about it. And laugh, and laugh... This is probably the\nblackest, darkest, most world changing movie (or topic of a movie) Marvel has done, but it ends up being slapstick\ncomedy within a buddy road-trip. This movie feels like theyve almost made a spoof move about something serious, and I\ndo not like it at all. This movie should have been dark, gritty, serious, and the focus should have been on the blood,\nthe dying, the ending of a world, but instead we get characters making jokes. This is not the movie I wanted and it is\nnot a movie about Ragnarok. This is a comedy movie about friends going on an adventure. No... I do not like it... Also\nthere are tons of topics just glanced over. Warriors three dying? Well, lets skip over that quickly shall we. Sif not in\nthe movie? Nah, who cares. Loki was Odin the last time around, well let us joke about that and move on. I still give\nthis movie a 5. It is very entertaining, it is funny, and the action is mostly fantastic. I can however not get over the\nfact that this movie should have been something completely different and in combination with bad taste jokes, and the\nracism, I cannot give it a higher score. Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far and I hope that this movie does\nnot spill over into other future Marvel movies, because this is how you kill a franchise...",

Big\nplot holes like Sif not even being mentioned, or favorite secondaries like Volstagg and Fandral being discarded in an\nunworthy fashion. Why is Hogun leading the Asgard army when he was disbanded by Thor in the second movie to remain in\nhis home-world? Why is Heimdall suddenly a traitor to the crown? Why does Odin pass away (as expected) so seamlessly and\nwithout a worthy scene like Friggas? Oh, i get it, all of this was done to be unpredictable, right?Well... leaving\naside that if you carefully watch the trailer, you know the entire movie in advance, the movie was very predictable. Big\nthumbs down Marvel for setting this tone, and an even bigger thumbs down to all those publication who call Thor 3 a work\nof awesomeness filled awesome art.

    "reviewTitle": "Guardians of the Galaxy but with much less interesting characters and storyline",
    "reviewBody": "Much anticipated and hyped Marvel entry this year is undoubtedly Thor:Ragnarok. There are # of rave professional reviews\nout there already on this movie. I saw it this week, the first day it opened in Korea, and I am absolutely puzzled what\nthe rave reviews were all about. Yeh, it is lighter in tone, yeah, it has more humor, and yeah there a lot more special\neffects, but nah, sum of all gives us a very familiar movie, some scenes very similar to this years superhero mega hit,\nWonder Woman, and some scenes even more similar to Thors soon to be avenging teammates, Guardians of the Galaxy. You\ncan tell that Taika Waititi who directed this movie, wanted this one to be something very different and new from the\nprevious two Thor entries, a Thor movie that can standalone, but what we get is a very differently toned Thor entry that\nis not new or fresh, but rather remindful of Guadians of the Galaxy. In my view, this is a wrong turn of direction for\nMarvel. First, you dont have Chris Pratt or talking raccoon, nor the cute, adorable treelike humanoid, Groot. You have\nChris Hemsoworth who can be funny at times but does anyone remember any of the movies he starred in, aside from MCU? So,\nthis time, it was talking Hulk that played the worthwhile sidekick role, and believe me, Hulk was funnier and more\ninteresting to watch. He saves the movie. Thor-Ragnarok also goes retro in its soundtrack, but also this is far less\ninteresting, auditory experience, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy. What they share in close similarity is that the\nwhole story mostly takes place outer-space and this is where fatigue comes to play. We like our superheros because we\ncan relate with them, and they team up and help weak, normal human beings in saving the world, while we watch with awe\nat their awesome superpower. Mostly this happens here at Earth. That is when it is most fun. Outerspace is already\ncovered by the Guardians team and we dont really need to add more. Also, their superpower status gets bit cloudy and\ncan get less interesting, since our creative human minds will always think and may assume that some big, wonderful\ncreatures, monsters, villains, may just well be hiding deep in unknown space, waiting for their chances to crawl out\nwith their undeniable power. The moviess most efforts are poured into showing good vs. evil fight scenes in dark,\nouter-space, by the means of visual effects. Story is very simple, something kids may like, but adults may find this\nmovie boring and puzzling by the time end credit rolls up. Hela, the goddess of death, is the main villain here, but\neven with her awesome, evil power, power that is great enough to destroy Mulnir and to hold back her better known\nsiblings, meets a quick death by another evil power who was somewhat easily handled by Helas less powerful sibling at\nthe beginning of this movie. Hmmm...Asgard is completely destroyed so, we wont see anymore of Asgards spectacular,\ngolden, futuristic sculptures, and buildings. We wont see Odin either. We may see Asgardians on Earth someday in some\nMCU entries. Dont know how that will all play out, but my curiosity is not peaking. Ah, I forgot to mention about the\ngrand master, played about Jeff Goldblum. He wasnt all that funny nor did I feel he played the role all that well, but\nmany reviewers seem to think otherwise. The character felt very annoying and forgettable. Because this one was so keen\nand focused on just being different, the story leaves out most of previous characters, characters interesting, and\nimportant enough, from the last two Thor entries. These efforts to be different and wildly light and humorous while\nhaving very little story to back it all up, may work this time around. The movie has a plenty of explosions, spaceships,\ninteresting weapons of destruction, etc. but what next ? By being a standalone movie, Waititi has left Thor alone, lost\nfar out in the space, very well disconnected. This will be a costly misstep for MCU to recover from. They will recover\nthis time, but a couple more of these misteps, and MCU will be competing much harder than now, with DC counterpart.",

    "reviewTitle": "Zeppelin, Cate, Goldblum",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. The ultimate cinematic dilemma  how to make the next comic book movie stand out from\nthe (many, many) others? The brilliant answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle\nand Christopher Yost \" a screwball superhero action film that delivers not only the required alien war scenes, but also\na campy villain for the ages in a movie that may be the funniest of the year.For those who prefer their superheroes dark\nand brooding, this one will be a shock. Prepare for Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster \" the most polite villain weve\nseen in awhile, and one who looks to be straight out of the 1960s \"Batman\" series. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is one of\nmany returning actors/characters, only this time he really gets to flash his comic timing on top of his Thunder God\nbiceps. His love- hate, trust-no trust, see-saw relationship with brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in full force, as is\nthe Bruce Banner banter with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Its certainly more in line with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY than the\nprevious movies for Avengers. As much fun as Goldblum brings to the party, this is really Cate Blanchetts show. She is\nthe frightening (with a dash of camp) Goddess of Death, and long-lost sister of Thor and Loki, and daughter of Odin\n(Anthony Hopkins). With a headdress that puts everyone at the Kentucky Derby to shame, Helas enormous powers are such\nthat she crumbles Thors mighty hammer with little effort \" just to remind everyone that big sisters are renowned for\nmessing up younger brothers toys.Of course, with that title, we know that the story revolves around what could be the\nend of Asgard. Joining in the fun are: Idris Elba who is back as Heimdall, Tessa Thompson as a master of one-liners\nValkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge - rewarded with a wonderful exit scene, Ray Stevenson returns as Volstagg, and rocky\nalien Korg who is voiced by director Waititi. Fans of the series will be happy to know other familiar faces pop up\nperiodically \" one especially magical sequence teaches Loki a quick lesson.In addition to the main rescue story line,\nthe powerful villains, and crazy aliens, there are numerous nods and tributes to previous versions (notably Planet Hulk,\nand Fantastic Four), and a hilarious early stage play with three cameos that make it clear, big time laughter is here to\nstay. Its fun to catch the reunions from such previous projects as Star Trek, JURASSIC Park and Westworld. Special\nacknowledgment goes to director Taika Waititi for hilariously taking the comic book film world down a different path.\nHes known for his comedic projects like HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (one of my favs from 2016), WHAT WE DO IN THE\nSHADOWS, and his work on the brilliant but short-lived \"Flight of the Conchords\". Its still very much a Marvel movie,\nwith visible fingerprints of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. Its also a fantastic adventure film that sets the\nstage for next years AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, while also featuring the best use ever of Led Zeppelins \"Immigrant Song\".\nSo get ready to rock, roll and rollick in a film that is just about as much fun as you can have in a theatre.",

Joining him is the enigmatic Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Mark Ruffolo as\nBanner/Hulk and Idris Elba reprising his role as Heimdall. We once again find ourselves immersed in a gladiatorial\ncontest between good and bad with Thor the central character binding it all together. This outing to Asgard is very much\nmore slapstick than the previous ones and there are many more moments of genuine mirth amongst all the fighting and\nslaying. Having said that, it in no way detracts from the story and from the core characters that have formed the stable\nof Marvel stories over the years. Add one Jeff Goldblum as a larger than life caricature of himself into the mix and you\nhave a thoroughly entertaining film. I want to see this again and soon.

    "reviewTitle": "Good but not 10/10!!! Really!!! 10/10 is a masterpiece",
    "reviewBody": "HOLD ON! before you click \"unhelpful\" let me just say that this movie is great and easily the best in the Thor trilogy\nhowever it does have flaws and that is why it is not 10/10. The comedy in this is really great and I like the overall\nfeel of the film, there is a big difference in the plot compared to the other two that makes this film feel much more\nfresh and enjoyable. However there are pacing problems, some of the actors seem stilted and dull (especially the grand\nmaster).The comedy is the foundation of this movie. Whilst The Dark world was a serious mess and the plot was really\ndark and boring, this movie keeps it very light and playful. Honestly even in the serious scenes there is a slight\ncomedic side that doesnt take away any of the seriousness. Waititi is a great comedic director having done some really\ngreat films such as Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do In the Shadows.He has always thrown a bit of New Zealand\nhumor and stupidity into all his films and it really helps to lift the tone and make it a bit lighter which really works\nwell in this film. Honestly I would really recommend his other films as they are all beautifully done. The actors who\nreally stand out in this are Chris Hemsworth who has taken a tone shift with Thor and made him less serious and \"more\nrealistic\" as a hero. Tom Hiddleston is great as always. He has not lost his gift of playing Loki well. The Two I really\ndid not like and Jeff Golblum and Cate Blanchett. Goldblum plays a really dull, goofy character which would work well if\nJeff Golblum could play anyone else except himself. All of the characters he plays in every movie are the same character\nand this takes me out of the film a lot of the time. Luckily he is not a main character thank god.Cate Blanchett plays a\nvery boring baddie with no real personality or charisma. She is the \"goddess of DEATH\" and keeps on saying through out\nthe movie that she is which doesnt add anything to anything. WE GET IT!!!!! you like death no can you try and have a\npersonality. Her helmet as well is stupid as fu#k (which is just a side note of something I hated). The plot of this\nmovie is stilted with random scenes thrown in but I still enjoyed it the story. When the plot was moving forward and the\npacing was actually good then the film got a lot more enjoyable. Unfortunately it was hampered by lots of \"random\ncharacter\" moments. One thing I really did not like is that random characters are in this for no fu$%ing reason!! Doctor\nStrange is in this for 5 seconds and really does nothing to help that could not have been done by Thor or Loki. It is\njust a pointless scene that doesnt advance the plot and probably was a studio executive decision so that they can plug\nmore movies.The technical side was interesting but had a little flaw. The CGI was meh with no real use other than to\nlook pretty but thats the problem now. CGI should be used to advance the plot and not really as a \"look at this\"\ndevice. If you like CG more than plot and character development then good for you I guess.I loved the music in this, it\nfitted the lighter tone Waititi was going for and worked well. It is a lovely score of 80s synth that fits the space\ntheme and tone and gives a sense of other world wonder. Honestly I hold music in high regard in film and this is one of\nthe better fitting soundtracks that Marvel have done. Its mostly all score as well with only one Rock song being used\nto great effect in the fight scenes. The colour palet of this movie is more vibrant than the last two films as well.\nMore neon and less dark colours make this film a lot more enjoyable to watch visually speaking. This goes hand in hand\nwith the music and the cinematography to create something which is really good and different from most of Marvels\nmovies. Overall this film is really good and I did enjoy it, however it was in the end another marvel movie with a few\nsmall changes and a great jokes. In a world where we have TONS of superhero films I just want one that breaks the mold\nand does something different from the norm. The last one to do that was Logan and I wish Thor Ragnarok had done more to\nfight against the Marvel plot conventions.",

He does some pretty epic sh*t in this movie and he is definitely not under-powered\nanymore. Thor in unleashed in this, I love that.2) Marvel did a damn good job in hiding some spoilers in the trailers.3)\ndesign-wise, the movie is totally beautiful. not a single bad effect in the movie. even the scene that changed from city\nto field looks better on the actual big screen.4) the freaking soundtrack. absolutely perfect. Immigrant Song FTW.5)\nHela is totally bad-ass too. powerful, commanding, with just the right amount of scenery-chewing. hell, a lot of\ncharacters are so delightfully over-the-top in this.6) great supporting cast too. Valkyrie owns everything the moment\nshe enters the movie. even Surtur was pretty darn hardcore. and Korg is freaking hysterical. Man I loved Korg!7) the\nmovies got a lot of humor. that may be a problem to some..but, when its time to take things seriously, the movie does\nexactly that. specially towards the spectacular third act, when real sh*t is going down, the humor dials back a ton. It\nis only during the Sakaar portions of the movie where most of the humour is, not without several moments of sincere\ncharacter interaction of course.8) I thought what they did with the \"Ragnarok\" part was kind of genius. this may not be\nthe Winter Soldier of Phase 3 they told us, but it does make some significant changes to the overall MCU, or at least,\nthe Thor section of the MCU.9) The pacing of the movie was perfect. Plus there wasnt a single scene in which I felt\nbored.Overall this was one of Marvels best films for me. It would definitely be in my top 5 marvel movies along with\ncivil war, winter soldier, guardians of the galaxy and iron man 1. Ill probably rank it at 2nd or 3rd!!!",

This movie has none of that.\nStorytelling has been shoved to the side to make way for unnecessary comedy, reducing every character to the comic\nrelief. Loki and Bruce Banner are two complex and sad characters who were only in the movie to satisfy fans and add more\njokes.Had it not been for the brilliant acting of Tom Hiddleston and Cate Blanchet, I probably wouldnt have seen the\nentire movie. This is not a superhero movie, this is a badly made action comedy. And as a long time Thor comic fan, this\nhurts my heart to write.",

    "reviewTitle": "Welcome to the Marvel Cosmic Universe!",
    "reviewBody": "Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells youd guess yourself after seeing\nthe trailer, is that its nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The\ntone is completely different. In fact its probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with its\nstraight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvels Cosmic\nUniverse in full swing. How this makes me feel isnt quite so clear. As I said, I really didnt mind the other Thor\nmovies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days,\nseems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and hes on top, What We Do in the Shadows form\nhere.Ragnarok is jam-packed full of jokes and gags, and every single one of them lands with aplomb. From Thor asking\nSurtur to pause while he helplessly spins around at the beginning, to the Grandmaster declaring a tie in Sakaars\nrevolution, each and every slither of humour is guaranteed to earn a laugh. Its typical Waititi humour; awkward,\nmodern, and using juxtaposition to great effect. Korg, a large being made of rocks, talking about his revolution failing\nbecause he didnt hand out enough pamphlets hits so hard because its so against what youd expect from that kind of\nalien.Waititis also in his element with running jokes, coming into a franchise nearly twenty movies in full of\ncontinuity to adhere to, poke fun at, and address in one way or another. Loki taking Odins place in Asgard is dealt\nwith swiftly, with a couple of gags thrown in, including surprise cameos. Hulk disappearing at the end of Age of Ultron\nis addressed with heartbreak and a couple of touching moments between Thor and Hulk/Banner. And Hela knocking over the\nInfinity Gauntlet in Asgards vault because its \"fake\" was a great way to plug such a tiny yet significant plot\nhole.Despite how humorous Ragnarok is, it doesnt shy away from more serious themes and ideas though. Thors companions\nin the Warriors Three are dispatched of quickly and without remorse, Hela raising an army of the dead from the Asgard\ncrypts is a pretty dark idea, and of course theres the whole Ragnarok thing. Not only is this movie one of the funniest\nentries in the MCU, but it also has some of the biggest stakes so far. By the end of the film, Thors life is\npermanently changed in a massive way. But Ragnarok is still not perfect. It still doesnt quite reach the heights of\neither of the Guardians movies or Winter Soldier. Its opening act feels a little messy, rushing through plot points to\nget to the meat of it. Thors tied up in chains at the behest of Surtur, now hes in Asgard unveiling Loki, now hes\nwith Doctor Strange looking for Odin, now hes in Norway bracing for Helas arrival, now hes on Sakaar about to face\nthe Grandmasters champion. Its almost all rushed, and some of it feels pointless. Like, Doctor Stranges role is\ncompletely unnecessary. Hes just put in for an Earthling presence in a movie that frankly didnt need it.Hela is also\nanother in a long line of lacklustre MCU villains. Shes the first female villain to pose as the main antagonist, which\nis great, and Cate Blanchett is perfect for her (I think Im in love). She has an interesting backstory, but its never\nreally developed. Hela ends up just becoming another two-dimensional mustache- twirling villain with a plan thats\nflawed from the offset and no motivation beyond just being evil. Her being the Goddess of Death is never really\ncapitalised on either, outside of her resurrecting dead soldiers of Asgards crypts reasonably early on.That said,\nalmost every other character is great. Thors sense of humour is brought to the forefront with some surprisingly great\ncomedic chops from Hemsworth, without it taking away from his more serious moments. Hes still Thor despite the tonal\nshift around him. Likewise, Loki is the same old Loki, with his tricks and betrayals, and his history with Hulk is\nplayed up to perfection. Valkyrie and Skurge both enjoy character arcs that help to develop them, and both Tessa\nThompson and Karl Urban make their mark on the movie. Waititi even gets to add some of himself into the movie as Korg,\nwho promises to steal every scene hes in. And of course Mark Ruffalo manages to play Hulk completely by himself for the\nfirst time and gives us the best Hulk weve ever had.Ragnarok is another part of Marvels current hot streak, and heres\nhoping it continues just a little bit longer at least. Its a massive tonal shift from the rest of the Thor franchise,\nfeeling closer to the Guardians franchise, which is a win/lose depending on your point of view. The music is a step in\nthe right direction, utilising Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song really well, as well as adding some 80s synth/video game\nmusic underneath Marvels standard, dull strings arrangements, but its largely still unmemorable and unremarkable. The\nvisuals are fantastic, employing a style closer to Snyders approach in the DCEU than Marvels usual grey realism, which\nI personally consider a massive plus. But of course its the humour that keeps Ragnarok afloat, and the massive stakes\nleave me begging to find out what happens next. I give Ragnarok a high 8/10. Easily the best Thor movie so far.P.S.\nWhere was Sif?!",

    "reviewTitle": "Good Fun, But Is That Enough? (SPOILERS)",
    "reviewBody": "Thor hasnt had a great track record in terms of films. I get the feeling the first film is met with a strange\ncontention, some think its a good time, others thin its okay, I personally really like it, I like its\nShakespeare-esque qualities and Im a sucked for inner family conflicts, the like of Thor and Loki. The second film,\nThor: The Dark World, is generally seen as being pretty meh and understandably, its pretty lifeless and without any\nreal interesting plot points at all, its a totally missable movie. Now comes Thor: Ragnarok, a pretty serious storyline\nin the comics but played a bit more for comedic effect here.Ragnarok is a good time, of that I wont contest. Youll get\na feel early on the film has been Guardian of the Galaxy-ised, that is to say its approaching the film with a more\ncomedic and tongue-and-cheek attitude rather than serious and Shakespearean vibe of the first film. The comedy, for the\nmost part, works well in the film. It doesnt always land perfectly, and especially in the first act I felt it felt a\nlittle off, but once you really get into the swing of it it works well and lands well and the actors land their lines\nwell.But I cant fully endorse Ragnarok, and its annoying, because despite how the comedic tone works Im not sure it\nreally aids the movie or the story its trying to tell. At the beginning of this film Odin meets his end, with Loki\nhaving been sat in Odins place for far too long it is now Odins time to pass, and he does, but now Hela, Odins\nfirstborn daughter, returns to take the throne and lead Asgard to war and domination, a conquest Thor must avert, but\nThor is weaker than Hela and is thrown from Asgard so now he must pull together a team to thwart the new evil. It sounds\nfairly Shakespearean-esque, and if you watched only the scenes in Asgard with Hela you might think thats the way its\ngoing to spin. Helas scenes are dark and brooding, serious, whilst Thor on Sicar (I think I spelt it wrong?) are light\nhearted and carefree. Its a feel I think clashes harshly because theres some real stuff Thor has to deal with\nhere.Firstly, Odin is dead, and secondly, Loki is essentially to blame for said death. I was expecting some kind of\nserious confrontation here. Everything that Hela is doing in this film is nothing Loki hasnt already done - Loki did\ntry (did?) blow up an entire one of the nine realms in Thor 1. Thor also though Loki was dead whilst Loki instead just\nsat on Odins throne and sat about. I think the film may have benefited if had worked more towards what Helas character\nseems to push towards. Hela speak of the lies of Odin, of how Odin was no great and honest king but also a tyrant. It\nwould have been interesting to have a three way struggle between the siblings of Odin about the treatment they were\ngiven under their father, the sins of the father, if you would, that would make for some very interesting a deep\nconflict.Its problems like this that prevent me from really liking Thor: Ragnarok, in many cases the motivations and\ncharacterisation of characters makes no sense in context to their actual character. The Valkyrie decides to help Thor,\nfor no reason I can discern, I completely get why she wouldnt help him. Loki seemingly decides to ally himself and\nstand by his brother by the end, despite the massive discussion they probably still have to have. It doesnt add up to\nme. In a medium that I love due to its story and character I think theres much wasted here, much that could have been\ndeveloped into an insightful, more character fuelled film.On a side note, I am worried about Marvels dramatic swerve\ntowards humour as of late, I get that the company wants their films to be light hearted and fun, which is completely\nfine, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier pulled off a really good story whilst incorporating comedic elements and\nstill told a good character driven story, I was hoping the same for Thor and I hope to see more stuff along those lines\nfrom Marvel soon.",

    "reviewBody": "With the third Thor movie called \"Ragnarok\" which means the apocalypse, you would think it would be the darkest entry in\nthe saga yet. Not so!By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in his special vision and kiwi\nhumour into the mix, this an amazing, kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride. Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is\nwonderfully funny, Tessa Thompson as Valkerie, a hard-drinking Asgardian warrior is a total breath of fresh air and Korg\n(played by the director) is just as eccentrically wicked as Rocket Racoon. The Age of Ultron got criticized by some for\nincluding a bar scene where the Avengers have fun with Thors hammer. But to be honest, Id always welcome the Avengers\nhaving a good old time, making jokes, bantering and insulting each other in the process.Doctor Strange makes an\nappearance, which is amazing. He takes his job as the Sanctorums gate-keeper very seriously and has no time for Lokis\nmischief. A very welcome change indeed in these troubled times.",

    "reviewBody": "I saw many people in the internet complaining about the \"fun vibe\" of the movie. Well, guys, ITS A MARVEL MOVIE! What\nthe heck are you expecting?! The trailer sell me a fun movie, and this was exactly what I receive. Didnt you?Look, Im\na really critical about the excess of jokes in the Marvel movies, I really believe that in some of them it doesnt work\nat all (like Civil War, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange). But here in Ragnarok for me was a improve, comparing with the\nother Thor movies (the first one suck, and the second its fun, but not that much too).Chris Hemsworth has amazing comic\nskills (way better than his \"dramatic\" ones), Mark Rufallo is great too, Tom Hiddleston, etc etc (you get it, the cast\nis great).The movie isnt a master piece (like Joss Whedon said), far away from that, they bet on the save (again), but\nthis time works. Cate Blanchett is F#CKING INCREDIBLE on the movie! And that is a improve when you think in the MCU (you\nknow... the majority of the villains in the movies suck). So, in short, for me Ragnarok is another very entertaining,\nfun, and well done Marvel movie. Doesnt will win an Oscar or something, but its good, and mainly, a lot better than\nthe first two.",

    "reviewBody": "*Just to note, \"Do You Find This Review Helpful?\" doesnt mean if you agree with the reviewers opinion or not, but\nrather, it means if the review actually describes the film, and what are its pros and cons. So please, dont just click\nNo below instantly. Thanks!*Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I brought that up just\nto tell you that Marvel is still standing strong until today, even at its seventeenth film, and the fact that this is\none of my favorite Marvel films.Im glad the film takes Thor differently. Unlike the first two, which are both mostly\nboring and trying to be very serious, this film is fun, and energetic.The best thing about this film is that its\nprobably the most fun entry of MCU. Its 90% filled with humor. Almost all of the main actors in the cast steals the\nmovie. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, and even Taika Waititi as Korg. They were all very interesting\nand funny characters, thanks to these actors that did great in their roles.I also have to give props to Taika Waititi\nfor his direction. The film feels very fast-paced (in a good way), energetic, and fun overall. The reason why its\ndifferent to most of what MCU gave us so far is that, again, its filled with humor most of the time. Its just a\nstraight up superhero-comedy film. And thats what makes is MCUs most audacious film yet.Sure, the previous MCU films\nmay have humor, but throughout the film, its laughs and giggles. Though it sounds bad that the film is mainly comedic,\nthe way the comedy is executed is very well done.Another plus for me is the action is very well-executed and visually\nstunning. The film is very colorful, and I loved the animation for the closing credits.The only flaw for me in this film\nis that there may be a lot of jokes in some scenes. Theres this one joke, and then theres another. In return, the\nviewer wouldnt handle all of it. Its a minor flaw, but I thought of it, so I had to include it here.Overall, its a\nvery fun and colorful film. Easily the best of the Thor films, one of Waititis best works as a director, and one of\nMCUs best efforts.Final Rating: 9/10  A",

This time it was not the case. Marvel universe movies have been my\nfavorites from the very beginning of the story and Thor:Ragnarok as the latest edition has surpassed my expectations. I\nwas hoping for a another good entry in the Marvel universe but this was on another level entirely. This movie is fun,\nfunny, full of action, well acted, fits the story perfectly and what is most important it feels fresh and original. It\nis different from the other Thor and Marvel movies and stands firmly on its own while still being a bridge to the\nculmination of the Marvel universe. Its light tone is in my opinion a good set up for the final chapters of the Marvel\nuniverse which are no doubt going to be much darker and more dramatic. But make no mistake Thor Ragnarok is a serious\nmovie with a thin layer of drama and darkness as well. Its not perfect but its flaws are tiny and barely noticeable\nwhen compared to the big picture. Without a doubt in my top 3 Marvel movies for now.",

    "reviewTitle": "My Thoughts On The New Thor",
    "reviewBody": "The plot of this hulk sized film is imprisoned the mighty Thor finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against\nthe Hulk his former ally. Thor must fight for survival and race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from\ndestroying his home and the Asgardian civilization. They actually did it they did a Planet Hulk film i had to say that\nbecause it pretty much is Planet Hulk and i have to say that to me the story was really well told and really well paced\nwhich is to be expected since the film is only two hours and ten minuets long.Returning as New Doug (if you dont get\nthe joke then watch the film) is Chris Hemsworth , Tom Hiddleston , Cate Blanchett , Idris Elba , Jeff uh ah uh ah uh ah\nGoldblum , Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. I have to admit i loved the chemistry between Chris and Tom at this point\nthey might as well be brothers and the same goes for Chris and Mark id say the only one that Chris doesnt have\nchemistry with is someone i cant mention since its spoiler. The rest of the cast do a solid job i know we make a lot\nof fun about Jeff Goldblum but damn he was good in this film you can tell that he was having a blast playing this\ncharacter and i hope to god that we get to see more of him in future movies and once again Tessa kills it i loved her in\nCreed and i love her in this im calling it right now shes going to win a lot of awards.Its taken them awhile but\nfinally Marvel have created another great villain at least in my eyes Hela was a true badass. The only real gripe i have\nwith her is more personal then anything and thats the fact her motivation wasnt that clear others might think the\nopposite but thats my opinion and she can actually beat people up and be an actual challenge for our hero and i hated\nher helmet.Wow this film has a lot of humor and i do expect a lot of it to go over peoples heads especially with the\nmusic choices but this film had me laughing out loud and hard we all know of the scene where Thor and Hulk first meet up\nand thats still funny but for me one of the best jokes in the movie is what happens after that scene and if youve seen\nthe first Avengers movie youll know why i laughed at that scene.Honestly at this point theres no point in my even\ntalking about the CGI because we all know its going to be good so instead ill jump right into the action which\nhonestly was rather refreshing just due to the fact that not a lot of it boiled down to who can hit who the hardest and\ntheres a badass scene with Thor near the end of movie which i was going to make a joke about but then i thought it\nmight be a spoiler.Damn the soundtrack for this film is really something and when i say the soundtrack i dont mean the\nscore used by composer Mark Mothersbaugh.i mean the songs they inserted into the film i kid you not one of the scenes\nuses \"Pure Imagination\" from Willy Wonka while not one but two action scenes use \"Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin and i\nwas OK with that.Overall i cant say this is the best Marvel movie because i think there are better movies but i can\nsafely say that this is the best Thor movie and the best Hulk movie for me this film gets an 8.5 out of 10.",

    "reviewBody": "I say this as a massive fan of Taika Waititi, but the Ragnarok and Planet Hulk comics are both such heavy weight story\nlines that easily could have been the Logan of their series for either Thor or Hulk and had been set up as such but they\nwhere just played for gaff humour there was no weight to this film because literally nothing was taken seriously.Im not\nsaying it wasnt funny for some people or have some very pretty shots like the Valkyrie shot used in the review I just\nthink that this film was so bad because they could have used another story and saved these to do something of weight\nwith it was a couple of hours of jokes and CGI and in a years time I dont think anyone will remember this film and for\nme it ranks in line with Ironman 3.......",

    "reviewTitle": "THOR Ragnarok \" the best of the 3 standalones",
    "reviewBody": "This is the third standalone Marvel Thor film, a swashbuckling superhero fantasy that continues directly after where\nThe Dark World ends. The premise is that Asgard is in peril, Thors objective is to prevent the destruction of his\nhome planet. This film introduces the villain Hela, she is the Goddess of Death, she is also Thors sister, who has\nbeen in exile for many years and appears to be a very powerful character, possibly more powerful than Thor! During a\nparticularly colourful action sequence, Thor is transported to a remote dump of a world, on the other side of the\nUniverse, this planet is full of rubbish and discarded people and is ruled by the weirdo Grandmaster outstandingly\nplayed by Jeff Goldblum. In order for Thor to get back, he first needs to beat the champion gladiator, who happens to be\nthe HULK. This is also the point where were introduced to another excellent show stealing character, Korg, voiced\nby the director Taika.The entire film is full of relentless adult comedy sketches and humorous dialogue, which was\ninspired by the humour and success of Guardians of the Galaxy. With a great soundtrack, this is a hugely entertaining\nfilm that balances humor with drama. Highly recommended.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Thor Outing Too Date",
    "reviewBody": "One of the biggest challenges with an ongoing series is crafting a story that is on par or better than the prior\noffering and that the characters continue to grow so audiences do not get a rehash of what they have seen before.With\n\"Thor Ragnarok\" Chris Hemsworth has returned for his third solo outing, and fifth outing overall as the heroic Asgardian\nwarrior Thor. This time out Thor is on his quest to track down the Infinity Stones and finds himself plagued by visions\nof Ragnarok: a legend detailing the fiery destruction of his home of Asgard.With an action laden opening, Thor believes\nhe has ended the threat and returns home to find his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), has been sent to Earth and his\nevil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assuming his place.Thor ventures to Earth with his brother which sets a series of\nevents into motion, the result of which unleashes the long imprisoned Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans the subjugation\nof Thor and Asgard. Naturally Thor is not going to put up with this, but finds himself mid battle knocked out of his\ntransit home and on a remote world called Sakaar.As if being stranded far from home is not enough of a challenge, Thor\nis forced to become a gladiator for the erratic Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), whom Loki has managed to charm and become a\npart of his inner circle.As fate has it, Thor becomes matched with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and must find a way to\nsurvive and make his way home before Hella can destroy all that he holds precious.The film is the best of the Thor films\nand it is engaging from start to finish. There is a significant amount of humor in the film but it does not feel forced\nand is very appropriate to many of the scenes. The film also has plenty of action and the blend between comedy and\naction is deftly handed by Director TaiKa Waititi who never lets the film become a parody of itself nor take itself too\nseriously at times. He knows when there is a time to laugh and when there is a time to be deathly serious.This allows\nfor a deeper and more enjoyable and engaging Thor than has been previously seen. He is not as one-dimensional as he has\nbeen in the past as the strong, quick to anger muscle that I would love to see explored in further outings.I had worried\nfrom the trailers that the movie might be more of a video game as it seemed heavily dependent on retro style CGI and\ncamp humor which made it seem like something out of the 80s. While there are elements of that, the film mixes the old\nand new to create one of the most authentic and enjoyable comic adaptations seen to date. It continues the winning\nformula of Marvel Studios and of course, sets up the next outing for Thor in \"Avengers: Infinity War\" as well as the\nlarger Marvel Universe as we a whole. The film also has some great cameos and I am curious to see how the addition of\nthe newly introduced characters will be explored down the road. The return of Hiddleston was also a real treat as he is\nso good as the mercurial but always sly and dangerous Loki that he commands your complete attention every time he\nappears on screen.Marvel has once again set very high standards for comic based movies and has again delivered another\nwinner that you will not want to miss.4.5 stars out of 5.",

The constant jokes, the beautiful visual effects, the amazing soundtrack, even better than\nthe Guardians I think, are just the things I paid for. Totally worth the money and the time. And spoiler alert, some may\nwonder how the fire monster beats Hela but Thor beats him at the beginning of the movie. My theory is that the fire\nmonster is brought back by the eternal fire at the end, so it makes him much bigger, hence maybe more powerful.Anyway,\none of Marvels best movies, the very definition of entertainment, I will see it in cinema again.",

    "reviewBody": "EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THOR : RAGNAROKThe Movie was a total waste of time, the Hulk was shown to be with a childs\nmentality getting upset and doing childrens moves. No explanation was given as to how the quinjet ended up on Sakkar,\nAge of Ultron in the time line comes after Thor the Dark World so even the explanation that he drifted into a spacetime\nbridge due to the conversion phenomenon is out of the question. The Hulk is Talking and no explanation is given for that\nhe seems not angry anymore so why is he in Hulk mode in the first place.The second Stupid thing that the Marvel People\ndidnt Even Bother to check was that in Thor the first movie Loki opened the Bifrost with the staff of ODEN (you can\ncheck the scene if you dont believe me) So how in HELL did Hela miss that knowing that she might be as ancient as Odin\nhimself, not even once did she witness him open the Bifrost with his Staff?? They went to conquer the nine realms\ntogether so not knowing that is totally DUMB, if Loki knows it Hela should know it too.Before Loki screams \"BRING US\nBACK\" Thor say \"NO\" as if Hela couldnt reach Asgard without the Bifrost....? She appeared from HEL her Dimension into\nMidgard Earth without any Help why would she need the Bifrost to get There??? And if She so desperately needed the\nBifrost for her conquest for the sake of argument she should have taken the sword the minute she landed on Asgard.AND\nHow come the Devils ANUS gets you Directly to Asgard?? and if it does every time shouldnt the Grand Master know about\nit ? He seems not knowing what Asgard even is while his brother deals with Asgardians ??The Zombie Army is Stupid, they\nare slow, they are killable by simple asgardian citizens, what kind of an army is that?? Hela could conquer an entire\nplanet by herself why would she need the dead weight.If Hela cant escape her Exile why did Odin send the Valkeries to\nfinish her off in the first place \"knowing how powerful she is\" that was a dumb move on Odins side. And we still dont\nknow if Hela is bound to Exile because Odin is holding her off or how precisely because as mentioned before she can\ntravel through dimensions at will. And if thats the case then she should be able to escape when Odin is weakened... say\nwhen he falls into the Odin sleep..?How did Odin abandon his responsibility as Protector of the nine realms and just\nwent to Norway to enjoy the view is completely IDIOTIC and when confronted by his sons he just says \"its your time now\"\nand vanishes?? He isnt injured, He is still capable of doing wonders but no he chose to turn into golden dust... Thats\npretty helpful thanks Odin.This movie went out of the frame that the fans and the Marvel Studios agreed upon, We expect\naction, a coherent story and good visual effects, if one of these elements is missing the movie sucks and frankly you\nshould fire the scenario writers who put together Ragnarok because its the Stupidest Movie Marvel Has Ever Made.",

    "reviewTitle": "Unexpected fun",
    "reviewBody": "This is the not the film I was expecting. As the third entry in the \"Thor\" franchise, I anticipated a traditional\nsuper-hero movie like the previous two: lots of drama and threat and the occasional humorous one-liner. But this is\nactually the funniest by far of all the works in the Marvel canon (now 17 films) and has clearly been influenced\nsubstantially by the commercial success of the two \"Guardians Of The Galaxy\" movies which came out in between \"Thor: The\nDark World\" and \"Thor: Ragnarok\". This makes for an immensely entertaining outing but inevitably dials down the tension.\nAs well as different writers, we have to thank for the new style New Zealand director Taika Waititi who additionally\nvoices the granite character Korg who could have stomped straight out of a \"GOTG\" film.As always with super-hero movies,\nwe have lots of noise and colour together with splendid sets and effective special effects, but ultimately what makes\nthis movie work is the cast. As well as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as brothers Thor and Loki, we have the\nwonderful Cate Blanchett as their gorgon-like sister Hela, another enjoyable female actress Tessa Thompson as a\nValkryie, Mark Ruffalo as the Incredible Hulk, and the delightful Jeff Goldblum as an unlikely- looking villain called\nsimply Grandmaster. The plot is rather confusing (but essentially Ragnarok = the destruction of Asgard) and the humour\nsometimes juvenile (a cosmic star gate is called \"the Devils Anus\"), but the whole thing is such F-U-N.Marvel movies\nalways have a teaser clip at the end and this time we are treated to two: one early in the credits and one at the very\nend.

    "reviewTitle": "Satisfying muscular myth and light humor.",
    "reviewBody": "\"Asgard is not a place, its a people.\" Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but\neventually not the physical land. Its all about the people, a gentle allusion to the plight today of immigrants who\nhave become travelers while bringing home with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry the Biblical heft\nand a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC for that matter,\nis the cultural mash up that reflects our civilizations abiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e.,\nbecoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity we were meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and\nself deprecation is a welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre is maturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor\n(Chris Hemsworth) is not just a hemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with the death of his\nfather, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (Cate\nBlanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and my families, but in a figurative way, just the same\nwith its challenging relationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they\nstill fight with broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awareness that battles will never really be\ndifferent because they reside in the mind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs and lows, our\ngreatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or Willy Lowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and\nfilms, and although the time and technology may differ, we still love and deplore our bloodlines as we work our way to\ndusty death. This Thor carries too many explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms are satisfyingly\nentertaining and sometimes downright allegorical.",

I enjoyed most choices in the movie even the ones that are most criticized such as\neasy discarding of Fandrall and Volstagg. For me those simply were used as highlighters of how Hela is in a league of\nher own thats simply beyond challenge. The ease they let people perish (akin to hawkmen charge in Flash Gordon) along\ndisco music was also one of the factors where I enjoyed that nostalgic fan ride.",

    "reviewBody": "So far, they have managed to make a good(ish) balance of light and sinister moments, but in this instalment, the scales\ntipped waaay too much into the silly jokes side. Im not an expert on Ragnarok, but I remembered it to be the end of\nAsgard, its gods, and most of the \"world\" as we know it. Death, destruction and sorrow, followed by a thin ray of new\nhope over the ruins. How did they think that they can turn this into a joke, and that it would work? Throughout the\nstory,the embarrassing jokes just kept coming, to the extent that often I felt Im actually watching a silly sitcom.\nDont get me wrong: I expected some light-hearted fun and banter during the build-up to the final battle (what Ragnarok\nis supposed to be), but then I thought it would turn into a dark, epic, moving, bloody but heroic finaleinstead, we have\nsome of that, but broken to pieces by cheap jokes. Honestly, Im not sure even a 10 year old would enjoy this mixture.\nThe missus really likes Thor (big surprise there, I know), and even she was looking at me in pain many times, rolling\nher eyes. I know some of the previous two episodes had some silly moments, but trust me, not like this: it is a whole\nnew level.The critics seem to love it though, explaining things into it I dont see in there (Im sure it is my fault).\nI liked the previous two Thor movies (with all their obvious flaws), but this, Im not sure if I will even buy later (as\nI used to, to complete the set on the self). For me, this was really disappointingPS: I actually liked the \"80s\nscience-fiction\" look  feel (sets, costumes, music) present in many of the scenes, though it seems to be disjointed\n(again...) with the previous movies.

    "reviewTitle": "Officially one of the worst movie trilogies in my book",
    "reviewBody": "Thor:Ragnarok, the very movie that got crazy praise, the movie that everyone is gushing over it. The movie that people\nclaim it \"brought back\" the fun in superhero movies. But is it really worth all of this high acclaim? I can safely say\nthat it doesnt. Just another over- hyped, generic garbage from the MCU. And to make stuff clear, no I dont hate \"fun\",\nand I am no elitist (be it as a comic book fan or as a movie Buff). I simply want a quality movie, no matter how its\ndone or constructed. And this movie cares less about all of this and focuses way too much on humor that it overshadows\nother important elements of the movie. To explain myself, I have nothing against escapism. When the movie sells itself\nand doesnt lie about its nature (whether its a heist, a simple action film or just a comedy), I dont go there\nexpecting a cerebral masterpiece. But I dont expect it to be a mindless filler thats sole existence is to kill 2 hours\nof my time without any other context or purpose whatsoever. So far, the movie is getting insane reputation, having high\npraise almost as other great comic book movies such as logan and the dark knight. But for these two movies, I can\nunderstand why logan and the dark knight get such high acclaim. Both completely reinvented the superhero genre in their\nown unique ways, by giving moral subtext and an engaging story. Thor:Ragnarok doesnt care about such. And yet its\npraised for its entertainment factor. Now ask yourself: is there really anything worth of such praise aside from how\nmuch \"fun\" the movie is? I still dont understand the praise for this movie. Its entertaining, but it is a bad movie.\nIts another proof that the MCU cares more about avengers movie than having a satisfying film. It exists solely to fill\nin the wait for infinity war.It suffers what other comic book movies do: there is no conclusion or a satisfying ending.\nTheyre focusing way too much on the next projects. Character development is almost non-existent, as well as character\nrelationships. All of the relationships rely on cheap, gimmicky comedy instead of seeing real characters interacting\nwith each other. None of the characters feel natural. In fact, it feels like the actors are merely cosplaying. And as\nusual, marvel shows they have no respect for the source material. Im no comic book elitist, and my knowledge of Thor\nisnt that of a die-hard one, but I know enough to spot when the character is bastardized. Im sorry, but a Thor who\ncracks jokes left and right while being captured and his home world being destroyed isnt who Thor is. Thor was more of\na noble warrior who speaks in ye old English, almost Shakespearean style. The previous movies failed not because of the\ntone, but because the writing and acting was lazy, thus you dont care about him. And this movie suffers pretty much the\nsame problem. And the other stories, as well as the hulk and Valkyrie, feel wasted. They are used unwisely. Both deserve\nbetter than just being in a film. In fact, planet hulk should have its own movie, not being a pointless subplot in a\nThor film. And about the whole \"fun\" aspect, I hate that. I hate that mentality in which the movie is praised simply\nbecause its fun. Getting all of this love just because you are entertained. But aside from that? The movie has nothing\nto it. Its being treated like its the first fun comic book movie we had in years. Have people forgotten about guardians\nof the galaxy vol. 2? Or was it generic and forgettable that people DID forget it? Overall, over-hyped garbage that\ndoesnt deserve any of the praise. One of the worst marvel movies, and the most disappointing movie of the year (even\nthough I had no expectations)",

    "reviewBody": "Since its first movies, Marvel is consistently going for more and more jokes, punchlines and witty remarks, in its\nmovies. Why?They have solid characters, solid scenarios and a ton of money behind each movie. Why do they keep making\neach character the equivalent of Tony Stark or The Joker, where, no matter the stakes, they have to pull a joke from\nsomewhere? Why dont they let the gravity of the situation weigh in to the viewers and they have to lighten up the mood,\nevery damn minute? Not to mention the number of times one of the characters makes a reference to something, completely\nout of character, like when Thor says \"Oh my god\", or when they refer to Hell (from the Christian\nmythology)...Seriously, didnt anyone from the producers read the script and voiced ANY objection???",

    "reviewTitle": "A descent into total collective madness",
    "reviewBody": "There is an unprecedented general approval of MCU movies without any regard for how good these movies actually are. In\nall fairness some of them are truly brilliant (Avengers, Winter soldier, Iron man, Guardians of the galaxy), and some of\nthem are just, in lack of a better word, bad (Incredible hulk, Ant-Man). In the last couple of years we have been served\nwith extremely bland and generic action movies that lack any grit, power or, in some cases, story (Doctor Strange,\nGuardians of the galaxy 2, Spider-man Homecoming, Civil war). All of these movies are fun, the time spent watching them\nis extremely fun. But, regarding the historic importance of the cinematic universe importance (and the fact that no one\nso far has managed to do the same even though attempts are being made), is fun and entertaining all you aspire to?\nHerein enters Thor: Ragnarok.The trailers boiled ones blood. The adrenaline of the music, visuals and characters blew\none away and you simply couldnt wait to see it. The end result was a question: \"What happened to the movie the trailer\npromised?\"Lets break it down a bit.1) Story. There are several actually, and not one of them makes any sense. The\nSurthur story is seen in the beginning and the end of the movie, destroying one of the most powerful characters in Norse\nmythology/Marvel comics. The Hela story is underwritten, shabby in execution and a waste of a spectacular character\n(played beautifully by Blanchett). The gladiator story is a disaster in every possible way. The irrelevance of the story\nor unprecedented, the way it slows down the progression of the Hela story is just criminal. So, the viewer is presented\nwith multiple ongoing stories that do not have any relevance in regard to each other, they are stuffed together without\nany real idea of how to execute them. The result is that the story we were promised was never actually given to us.2)\nThe humor. That lighthearted approach to every situation, no matter how dark or difficult it is, that Marvel has been\ndoing lately (e.g. Civil war), has in this case actually killed the movie (Civil war does have a redeeming ending that\nis as dark and gritty as it needs to be). Comedic segments serve as wonderful relief in many ways. In horror movies, if\nimplemented correctly, can be a great layer to the whole experience (e.g. IT). In dramas they can create mixed emotions\nin viewers so that they actually laugh instead of cry. The key - IMPLEMENT CORRECTLY. Ragnarok not only overused comedic\nelements, it used them in all the wrong places. So, when one is supposed to feel sorrow - laugh; when on is supposed to\nfeel excited or filled with adrenaline - laugh etc. etc. etc. There was only one moment in the entire movie that was\nrelieved of the humor - the bridge and main fight scene between Thor and Hela. But, even in the very end when all hell\nbreaks loose (literally), we cant fathom the gravity of the situation because yet another character dropped a pun or a\njoke. So, enough is enough, really.3)The portrayal of characters. So, all of the above can be blamed on bad direction\n(the terrible way of telling the story and not knowing how and when to interlock certain story segments) or bad\nscreenplay (humor EVERYWHERE). But, the way the characters were portrayed was unbelievable. At the end of the movie one\nthing is certain: this movie was made just to depict where Thor and Hulk were during the events of the Civil war. Why\nand how certain story segments occurred - no answer. The criminally underused Antony Hopkins, the lack of screen time\nfor Blanchett or Elba (the only actor that took his role seriously, God bless him), the absolutely unnecessary Dr.\nStrange cameo or Karl Urbans forgettable and clich character just proves that bundling together too many characters\nthat have no relevance to the story(stories in this case) doesnt make it fun or good in any way.All in all, Thor:\nRagnarok just continues the general downfall Marvel movies have established. The once brilliant concept of a shared\ncinematic universe is now a money making machine that has no real idea of where it is going or how it is going to end.\nAt one point it will have to end, my concern is do the executives know that. I was really excited for Infinity wars, now\nI am just scarred to death they are going to do the same thing they did to all of the movies in the last couple of\nyears.Congratulations, enjoy a bland action movie, have a great laugh to the end of the world, because thats what the\nend of everything (Ragnarok) should feel like - lighthearted",

    "reviewTitle": "A more funnier Thor than youre used to...",
    "reviewBody": "It is a lot more funnier then its predecessors. To be honest, I was a little worried going in that it was going to have\nthe GOTG 2 treatment, and it was going to be too joke-y. (Not that I hated that movie or anything, I still really\nenjoyed it). But anyway, I am glad that it still managed to have scenes that were dramatic or heartfelt. It was a nice\nbalance. And surprisingly Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing. He was a highlight of the film for me. Tom\nHiddleston of course is great at Loki. Cate Blanchett plays Hela as very dark and sinister. Shes probably not my\nfavourite villain, but shes up there. I liked that she was kick-ass and actually felt like a true threat. I liked that\nwe got more of Hulk that wasnt just him smashing stuff in fight scenes. Jeff Goldblum kind of just felt like Jeff\nGoldblum playing another zany character. I mean, his character was fun but I dont feel like he truly transformed or\nanything. I liked Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. I especially liked her introduction scene. But somehow by the end when it\ncame to big boss battle, she didnt really shine. I remember other characters moments. Thor being able to summon\nlightning without his hammer is really cool, and is something I look forward to more once Infinity War arrives. And I\nalso quite liked that there was an overall redemption arc to the film. One part of the film that did bug me/didnt make\nto much sense (and this where I will get a bit spoiler-y) is that they make this claim that the fiery demon guy(forgot\nhis name) is the only one who can bring Hela down. And when he is released, Hela does have a \"Oh Crap\" look on her face.\nAnd yet, Thor destroyed him earlier in the film. So why is that Thor cant take Hela down himself? I also didnt like\nHogunn, Fandral and Volstagg were barely in the movie and got killed off almost immedietely. I think their characters\ndeserved a bit more. The CGI for the most part was really good, but theres a particular scene that takes place in\nNorway (or was it Finland?) that was a very obvious looking green screen. And this is a minor quibble, but its not\nbelievable that Hulks pants stay on. I know this happens in all the other movies (and they obviously cant show Hulks\nbits) but at least with past movies, I can buy that he wears baggy or bigger sized pants and just belts it so it stays\non. But in the film, they had this running gag that his pants are very tight (and had pull at his crotch a few times),\nso it just feels extremely silly that they stayed on. They should have just done away with it. But overall, I did really\nenjoy this film. Im not sure where I would rank it. I mean were 17 movies deep by this point, so I could use a re-watch\nbut I think this is one thats higher up.",

I mean there arent any variations to his\ncharacter to provide something different. Its just the same character villain again and again. Tom Huddleston is a\nboring actor. I hate his soft spoken voice. He thinks hes doing Shakespeare. And why are they making a Thor movie look\nlike a Custodians of the Cosmos (i.e. Guardians of the Galaxy) movie? The Thor movies had a Viking vibe to them which I\nliked. Also severe under usage of Heimdall. Im not running to the theaters for this one.",

    "reviewTitle": "Hippy Hippy Thor",
    "reviewBody": "Thor was always a tricky comic book character to bring to big screen. Kenneth Branagh managed to do it by making the\nfirst film as a mock Shakespearean action film fuelled by dysfunctional family dynamics. He was instrumental in casting\nTom Hiddleston as Loki.Unfortunately Thor:The Dark World was rather dreary. Marvel has taken a left turn for Thor:\nRagnarok by getting inspiration from The Guardians of the Galaxy film by underpinning the film with comedy.King Odin has\nbeen sent to a nursing home on Earth by Loki who has pretended to be Odin at Asgard. Thankfully Doctor Strange felt Odin\nwould be more at home in Norway.When Thor returns to Asgard he sees through Lokis disguise. When they go to meet a\ndying Odin, he tells both of an evil older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett) who will return and cause chaos.Thor:Ragnarok\nis a rather trippy neon lit 1980s infused adventure film. In some ways it nods a hat to movies like Big Trouble in\nLittle China.Thor is both aided and thwarted by evil brother Loki who sees Thor getting a painful bashing that he\nendured in the hands of the Hulk who is the main star in a planet where beings take part in a gladiatorial contest.It is\nAsgard and some of the regulars from there who get short shrift, characters such as Heimdall. Karl Urban who plays\nHelas henchman called Skurge is rather wasted of his talents as we know he is capable of giving much more. Even\nBlanchett is rather bland as the villainess, Hela. In some ways the film is rather dark and brutal but it is always\nundercut by the comedy.",

    "reviewTitle": "a director totally in sync with his cast - one of the funniest movies of the YEAR, nevermind MCU",
    "reviewBody": "In brief: this was a damn space craft full of fun. Thor Ragnarok is Douglas Adams by way of Jack \"King\" Kirby, both from\nhis Thor run and other (MANY) space fantasy comics in look and brawny, iconic feel (and this time, maybe the first time,\nLarry Lieber gets a screen credit!) Waititi is stupendous with his actors and they give back in kind.If only the action\nwasnt so been-there-done-that (or maybe its the CGI being so overwhelming that it consumed the actors in some shots).\nThat said, this continues the goofy-but-serious space-operatic look from the Guardians movies, and it ups the stakes\nfrom the previous Thor movies - its *easily* the superior of the three, the most human and with a more interesting\nvillain(ess), though I wish Blanchett were in it a wee bit more, not to mention Waititi himself playing a rock monster\nwith a droll sensibility - so it stands out from the pack very easily. Even Thor gets an arc this time, which was fairly\ntypical if there at all, and I dont even know if there was one in The Dark World (that movie was so forgettable I\ndidnt recall what happened to Odin at the end of that story.Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner gets fun stuff to do throughout (he\ngets to talk, a lot, this Hulk, so take that what you will), and everyone gets a moment to shine, from Tessa Thompson to\nKarl Urban (mostly his arc is serious, but he starts off the movie with a terrific jokey scene), to even the\nwhoever-she-is that has to work as the Grandmasters secretary. Its not as emotionally full of depth as the Guardians\nseries, but I did also appreciate where the movie ends up as far as the fate of Asgard; even if its a small way, it\nfelt like Marvel taking a real chance - the first time they did something like that since Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin,\nand like that it works - and while, again I must stress, much of the action doesnt carry much consequence, as a comedy\nwith that spirit of Adams (from Hitchhikers Guide AND Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, I almost forgot till a friend\nreminded me Odin and Thor and Loki were in that), its firing on as many cylinders as the other MCU movies this year.\nIts a breezy, wild space adventure. It knows its audience, and it gives winks and nods to how silly it all may be, but\nwhen it needs to be serious it can do that too (or at the least, Cate Blanchett gets to chew on some scenery, but not\nall of it, if you catch my drift - she knows what shes in and is having the time of her life in a way I havent seen\nsince Crystal Skull).",

    "reviewBody": "THOR RAGNAROK REVIEW :The one thing i always liked about Thor series is that they never gave a long run time film, they\nalways believed in keeping it short and grippy. Thor Ragnarok wins half race here, rest half is won by Terrific Visuals,\nMassy Writing and throughout tight screenplay. Film has a quick beginning and may be thats the point where film keeps\nyou hooked and it remains same till the End. Doctor Stranges Cameo is Pleasing. The villain Hela is powerful and her\nback story is well written. Thors \"Revenger\" team is Great, you see some more addition in Marvels superheroes list.\nThat anticipation of Hulks entry worths the wait as he arrives with the bang. Climax is well crafted, every thing is\nused perfectly by Director. Background music is decent. Cinematography is Excellent. Visual Effects are so good that i\ndeclare this one the as the most Visually spectacular film of Thor Series. Editing is Brilliant, no chance to point a\nfinger. Direction is Very Good, could have been better but when everything looks good i dont think its fair to talk on\nminor mistakes of director. Overall, Thor Ragnarok is a Perfect Money Making entertainer from Marvel. Marvel just cant\ndisappoint with a good Superhero film. If youre a Fan of Marvels superheroes films then Thor Ragnarok is a MUST SEE\nfor you. Classes and masses both will love it, especially mass lovers. No doubts, Film will be a huge success at box,\nget ready for Highest Grossing Thor Film. Go for this one and have a BLAST, i guarantee you will not be disappointed.\n7/10* by me, i would have loved to give 8/10 but i think a massy film does not deserve that rating even if its too\ngood.",

    "reviewTitle": "God Of Thunderous Applause and Comedy",
    "reviewBody": "Hes big, hes flashy, and he has locks of hair and a body that slays many. Yes, hes Marvels own Thor, and tonight is\nhis third solo movies release date. In hopes of smashing the box office, Disney has brought the God of Thunder back\nwith a darker twist in hopes of reigniting the magic of Marvel. Welcome to Robbie Ks movie reviews and tonight we\nanalyze, observe, and share my opinions on yet another movie to hit the silver screen. Lets get started!LIKES:Special\neffects: Disneys team is the master of money, which entitles them to deliver a dazzling display of cinematography\nmagic. Thor Ragnarok is another example of how the Marvel universe can be brought to life. Dazzling special effects fill\nthe big screen in the form of natures wrath, flying projectiles, and monsters of various designs. While certainly not\nthe most realistic of the graphics, Disneys group crafted fluid animation, colorful spectacles, and of plenty of\nspeaker blowing sound effects to go with it. If thats not enough of a selling point, then how about the special effects\nof Chris Hemsworths body will be happy to please the eyes of many female fans, plenty of shots according to my friends\ntonight. Action: Remember the first Thor where there wasnt much battling, but more babysitting? Yeah, well the Thor\ngroup managed to take the action of the avengers, and kind of cram it into this movie. Ragnarok, spares no time diving\ninto the action, and keeps it spread throughout the entire 130-minute run time. The darker themes of the story certainly\nallowed this, and thank goodness, the directors took hold of the opportunity. While Thor certainly gets more of the seat\ngripping battle scenes, this movie provides the other cast some rather impressive scenes. And finally, Marvel has broken\nthe cycle of lame villains, giving Hela (Cate Blanchett) some bite instead of just barking. With all these contenders\nand the edginess of the movie, you can rest assured that the dullness of Thor has been broken. Comedy: By far though,\nThor Ragnaroks biggest selling point is comedy the series is so famous for. The third installment is perhaps the\nfunniest of the bunch, trading whiny complaints of assistants and naked walks by old professors Instead, the writers\ndecided to fill the movie with a lot of diverse comedic ploys to keep the chuckles coming. Slapstick humor,\nwell-delivered one-liners, wacky catchphrases, sarcasm, and banter to no limits. Ragnarok has all this in fantastic\namounts to keep the movie as fun and entertaining as possible. Even better, is how the comedy is also integrated into\nthe action scenes, showing that the writers in Marvel havent lost their talent after all. The music itself is also\nfunny comedic relief, sounding like something out of an 80s video game, in all its dazzling, electric keyboard glory.\nDISLIKES:Missing Character Stories: Ragnarok has a lot of good with it, but one thing that was slightly annoying was how\nsome of the characters lacked complete background information. Valkyrie in particular was a little rushed, leaving out\nsome key things that could have made her an even deeper character. Even Hela herself has a rather shallow story, glazing\nover what could have been some cool sequences for some overdramatic banter about how hurt she was. Outside of Thor and\nLoki (who have had movies to weave their tale), the backup characters seemed slightly diluted in the grand scheme of the\nmovie. Over-hyped Action: Dont get me wrong, Thor had plenty of excitement to amp up the pace and excitement of the\nmovie. Unfortunately, the sequences are rather short-lived, or more comedic than actually exciting. With the bar set\nhigh for me, I was hoping that the scenes were going to be more intense, filled to the brim with fist punching,\nlightning throwing, and sword wielding incredibleness. And just as the momentum was building, they dropped it for more\ncomedy and banter between Thor and some other character. This particular scenario was especially true for Hulk Vs. Thor,\nwhich while entertaining, was disappointing on the exciting action part. While the conclusion managed to build up my\nhope, it too didnt have quite the zing I had hoped. Despite all this though, I still enjoyed the action. The\nVERDICT:Truth is, Thor Ragnarok, while being dark, is one of the more entertaining films of the bunch on so many levels.\nIts got a fast pace to keep things going, action to liven up the scenes, a villain who doesnt entirely stink, and\ncomedy to keep the dialogue fun as well. If youre like me you will be laughing almost the entire movie, but if you are\nones preferring over the top slapstick and innuendos out the wazoo, then slow your roll for this movie. While I would\nhave loved to see more character development (and use) of the secondary characters and a little more excitement in\nbattles, truth is this is one of the better Marvel films in a while. And of course, with all the special effects, this\nreviewer cant help, but recommend you see this movie in theaters. Beware thoughthis movie is a little more\ninappropriate for younger audience members not only due to the more adult comedy, but also for the language used in this\nfilm. Exercise caution please when choosing this film, and plan a babysitter if you dont want little ears hearing\ncourse dialogue. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",

    "reviewTitle": "Really funny if sometimes to its detriment, but certainly had me laughing.",
    "reviewBody": "The Thor films have been kind of average so far; can a quirky New Zealander change all that?Thor: Ragnarok is the third\nfilm in its own series and Thors fifth appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. This time its directed\nby Taika Watiti and also features the Hulk as a main character. For starters Id like to say I love Taikias work; his\nfilm Hunt for the Wilderpeople is hilarious to me and any interview you watch of his is a joy to behold. He has a very\nunique style of film so I can see why Marvel chose him to inject some energy and humor into this series. And he does do\nthat. Ragnarok is the most entertained Ive been while watching a Thor movie but its not without its\nproblems.Story-wise, there is a very quick set-up. You can tell that Taika and producer Kevin Feige wanted to completely\ndismantle what had been built up in the previous Thor films. I can understand why they wanted to do that but just seeing\nmythology, characters, and arcs that have been established since 2011 be wiped away or brushed under the carpet was a\nlittle disheartening, and this was all during the first act. It was very quick and we were going from scene to scene and\nlocation to location very quickly mopping up old plot threads and setting up what this movie was going to be. Once that\nhad happened, and Thor was on the planet Sakar, it became more enjoyable for me. The rest of the movie showcased Taikas\nstyle of humor perfectly and had me laughing out loud plenty of times. It did seem a bit like two films at times with\none set on Sakar and the other on Asgard as the story kept flipping from one to the other but I was entertained enough\nwith the characters.Chris Hemsworth has always played Thor brilliantly and we get to see a lot more of his comedic\ntalent here. Mark Ruffalo is always a highlight of any film for me and seeing him here was great both as Banner and the\nHulk experiencing this mad Universe. Tom Hiddlestons Loki, of course, appears again and although the character has\nperhaps lost some of his popularity since everybody loved him in The Avengers, I enjoyed seeing him because I like Tom\nHiddleston as an actor. Two new characters I absolutely loved in this film though, were Jeff Goldblums Grandmaster who\nis hilarious; Goldblum barely has to act, his own wacky charisma comes through perfectly. And Korg, voiced by Taika\nWatiti himself had some of the best lines. Id definitely say the characters were the best part of this film for me.In\nthe end, Id say I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok. The story is pretty basic and some of the green-screen wasnt great\nduring the re-shoots but I loved the aesthetic and the characters. I laughed a lot too even though I felt some of the\nemotional beats were lost due to quick jokes. I still look forward to following Taikas work and Im looking forward to\nseeing where the character of Thor himself is taken too.",

    "reviewBody": "If you are a die hard Thor fan, you may be sorely disappointed in this movie. Unless your idea of Thor is one of the\nMarx Brothers. The movie is fun. Key word, fun. It is a comedy throughout the entirety of the movie. It really doesnt\ntake the comic genre seriously but that might be what makes it enjoyable to watch.",
