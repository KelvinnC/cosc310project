    "reviewTitle": "I would not call it a masterpiece as some did",
    "reviewBody": "There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.",

    "reviewTitle": "Worthy Acting Performance By Phoenix Worth a Watch, but This Joker is Not Smart Enough to Become the Joker We've Come to Know",
    "reviewBody": "Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.",

    "reviewTitle": "Timely and driven by a great lead performance and cinematic reference, even if it is not as smart as some would have you believe (SPOILER)",
    "reviewBody": "Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the \"maybe it was all imagined\" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe.",

    "reviewBody": "I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"That's Life.\"",
    "reviewBody": "In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.",

The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\nIs this a movie I would watch again?

    "reviewTitle": "\"My life is nothing but a comedy.\"",
    "reviewBody": "Right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie. It may be based on a comic book character, but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty, abusive parents, disrespect for authority, the distance between the haves and the have-nots, and an uncaring society at large. With a plot often times structured on ambiguity, the film explores the troubled mind of one Arthur Fleck, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career. No offense intended to Jokers who have gone before, but Phoenix's take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow, but virtually impossible to match. I must say, the hype engendered by the film prior to it's release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated. Yes, there is violence on Arthur Fleck's part, all of it gruesome, but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the 'Saw' series for example, or any number of slasher/gore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to 'entertain' fans of that persuasion. Together, director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds it's release in savage, sociopathic behavior. Though he may be called the Joker, as Arthur Fleck himself would surely attest, \"...no one's laughing now\".",

My main bone of contention with this film is that it really doesn't need to be tied up to the whole superhero genre, setting up the rivalry with Batman for at least half the running time; it's a better film than that and would have served better as a stand-alone psychological portrait of mental breakdown. Films this seems to have been inspired by include THE MECHANIC, THE KING OF COMEDY and of course TAXI DRIVER.",

    "reviewTitle": "Signifying nothing",
    "reviewBody": "Why does this movie exist? Who does it exist for? Why do people love it so much?These questions reverberated inside my head as it played in front of me. I was waiting for a moment where I would be awestruck, blasted by its sublime genius that so many people had trumped up or maybe even worried by the philosophy that so many people were worried about.I felt absolutely nothing.Joker might seem like a good movie if you've never seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. But here's my struggle. Those movies have something to say. Something to prove. They aspire to be art when this film is simply commerce.If you think this is a good film, tell me what it has to say. Tell me the meaning of it and why it exists other than, \"The Joker is cool\" or \"This is the Joker's origin story.\" What is the purpose of watching a man's horrible life that never gets better and only gets worse and then the lives he touches get destroyed along the way.I mean, is it a cliche to use that sound and fury signifying nothing quote when this movie is so rote that it uses the song \"White Room\" in perhaps the most obvious of ways? Nothing is unexpected. Nothing is unique. This movie is the definition of wallpaper, albeit wallpaper bought by a tween at Hot Topic because they desperately yearn for something, anything, to make them seem different than the herd while mooing their way through the fields of utter boredom.Director Todd Phillips started his career by directing Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies while he was still a junior at NYU. His second film, Frat House, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance before HBO bought it. It never aired, as many of the film's participants claimed they were paid to enact the scenes in the movie.A third film, the Phish-following Bittersweet Motel, was his last documentary before making the movies Road Trip and Old School for producer Ivan Reitman. His career since has been a series of successes, like Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, Due Date and The Hangover series.Which brings us to this movie.It's written by Scott Silver, who wrote 8 Mile - good - and X-Men Origins: Wolverine - bad. He also wrote The Fighter, which won him an Oscar nomination.I always feel like you should say something nice first.So here's goes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is great. It's acting desperately searching for a better movie to be in. His goal was to play a character that audiences couldn't identify with - that seems odd for the main role in a movie - studying assassins instead of people who had played the Joker before.He plays Arthur Fleck, who starts out the film as a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother Penny (Francis Conroy, every season of American Horror Story). A disorder causes him to laugh out loud for no reason and he depends on the government for his meds.An attack while working as a clown leaves him needing a gun, a gun that falls out of his pocket while working in a children's hospital. He also begins dating his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beats, who was in Deadpool 2 and Slice) and finds that a video of him on stage has gone viral, ending up on his favorite TV program, The Murray Franklin Show.The fact that Robert DeNiro is inversing his The King of Comedy role, playing Jerry Langford instead of Rupert Pumpkin, is the type of creativity normally reserved for college freshmen who believe they are the first people to ever read Herman Hesse.Arthur is beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He shoots two of them in self-defense before feeling so good about himself that he kills the third. This leads to Thomas Wayne - who Arthur's mother believes is her son's father - denouncing whoever did this killing as a clown.Soon, people are rioting in the streets wearing clown masks and Arthur is finally feeling like his life has meaning. However, two Gotham cops visit his mother, looking for the killer of the businessmen, and she has a stroke. This causes Arthur to either go off the deep end or become sane, as his meds have run out. He realizes that he has no girlfriend and that everything in his mind has been a lie.This brings him to The Murray Franklin Show, where he embraces the name The Joker, inciting another riot that also leads to Joe Chill killing the Waynes inside Crime Alley after a showing of Zorro The Gay Blade. Yes, that really happens.Another potentially crazy person was angered by this movie. Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in Suicide Squad and reportedly sent used condoms and dead rats to his co-stars, was alienated and upset by the fact that Warner Brothers was making a Joker movie without him. He even left his agents over this and attempted to get people to cancel this movie.I've heard words like groundbreaking and Oscar being thrown about because of this movie. As a society, we've really devalued those two words, huh?This is a movie that may not even be about the real Joker. It might not even connect to anything. And it's a movie about a man forgotten and thrown away that becomes somebody before being nobody. It's also a waste of two hours of your time.Man, I should work in some other nice things. The cinematography feels large in scope, when so many other films seem small these days. I also loved seeing the old Warner Brothers logo.I mean, this won the Gold Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It also had an eight-minute long standing ovation.I sat there waiting, hoping, struggling to find one moment of entertainment and relevance and walked away saying, \"That was a movie.\" It should be something more.Instead, I'll have to see people wearing this costume and thinking it has some significance. These are the same people who think naming the comedy club \"Pogo's Comedy Club\" is daring because it references John Wayne Gacy instead of hammer soft irony.We deserve better and have become so mired in the dross that we think that movies like this are worth something. I'm not being an elitist - I love popcorn films and if you read this site you know I have a soft spot for Italian horror and 80's slashers - but when I see something that is s***, I have to call it the purest s*** I've seen in years.",

    "reviewTitle": "Okay movie elevated considerably by its lead performance",
    "reviewBody": "This is \"Joker\", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But let's not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his \"army\" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree.In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and the guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his \"human form\") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me.",

    "reviewBody": "Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.",

    "reviewBody": "Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.",

    "reviewBody": "This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly \"explained\".That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed.",

There are endless shots of a solitary, anguished Joaquin Phoenix, which get pretty monotonous.In a nutshell: adopted boy suffers brain damage from a brutal father, lives with a sick mentally ill mother, and, after getting beat-up by street hooligans, builds a self-pitying clown alter-ego that's going to hold up a mirror to a dismissive society. *Yawn*Of all the actors who have played Joker, Heath Ledger got the right balance of being a scary, crazed, murderous, diabolically clever sociopath who could go toe-to-toe with Batman. The pathetic, hapless Phoenix character lacks all of that persona.Yes, Phoenix does an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. But that alone doesn't save a film that is a boring flop because it is monotone, dark, dour, and mostly pointless.",

I must agree that it will not give you a thrill, but it gave me the chills.You know this Arthur will be the Joker, you know things will go wrong. Everything is focused on Arthur, it is like you are watching over the shoulder and see him getting worse and worse. I must say that I did not like most reactions on his person from other people, but then I think: it is a comic, this is Gotham. So it fits perfectly.Also the second layer that the rich are controlling the poor and average people. The Joker is the result of the (wrong) choices of society. But it was not clear for me why he was back with his mother after the horrible things the mother did, also because she is crazy. And why are they just sitting in a house among the normal people? Because of the rich people?So for me it is not the perfect movie, but I really liked that you are so close. And you can really feel how he feels and you understand his anger. Everytime I am waiting: when will it happen. As a viewer you also get fooled, like he is being fooled, so that is nice also.Then ending is a bit weird again and reminded me again: this is Batman, it is a world full of overdone things. But everything is only secondary, the primary thing was Arthur and the becoming of Joker. For that it is worth an 8, great acting, great filming and setting. But I wanted to see more Joker, I see him, but not completely yet. Maybe he had to grow after this. I don't know...",

    "reviewBody": "One of the key tenets of superhero franchises is that there are well defined good guys and bad guys. But what if it weren't as simple as that? Todd Phillips's \"Joker\" subverts the genre, casting Batman's nemesis as the protagonist, portraying him as an abused, mentally unstable man at the end of his rope in a socially stratified Gotham City. We also get a different look at the Waynes: far from the upstanding citizen whom we expect, the dad is a heartless creep (servant Alfred isn't much better). It's one of the most intense movies that I've ever seen. Not at all like the comic book adaptations to which we're accustomed. It deserved its Golden Globe wins, and I'd say that it deserves at least one of the Oscars for which it's nominated.In addition to Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, there's also Robert DeNiro as a mean-spirited comic, Frances Conroy (of \"Six Feet Under\" and \"American Horror Story\") as the Joker's infirm mother, and a number of other people.",

    "reviewTitle": "Joaquin Phoenix's best role",
    "reviewBody": "It's not every year that an actor can get to the top with a unique role. Playing the fictional character the Joker has been tried for many decades by various actors but the closest one to the original was Heath Ledger who won an oscar for the role. Now, it's Joaquin who has taken the lead. A disenchanted individual who tries to cope with life as it hands out grime and dirt in its most ruthless form, starts to take it's toll on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin) who was adopted by his disillusioned mother who suffered severe psychiatric problems. Stemmed with endless turmoil in Gotham, Arthur begins to realize what life has to offer. Yet none of it gives Arthur a sense of relief except when he kills starting with three thugs on a subway line. From then on, his mind clears away the hazy images that his medications blocked him with, to advance further and further into his own existential madness.\nI found this version of the Joker to be very gratifying, especially as Joaquin nailed the comic clown's persona to a perfect 'T'. Becoming Gotham's crown prince of crime in upsetting the natural order of things as we see it normally. Such as politics, monetary issues, or just living day to day in a world of chaos brimming with upheaval and despair that surrounds us all. Director, Todd Phillips was brilliant in showing us the gritty, dirty streets laced with crime in all corners. Not just the for the elite, but for all levels of humans who want to escape but can't for reasons of either insanity or just plain nostalgia that all people relate to when they move into a new corner of the world.\nIt is a clear reminder that for the most part, people from all walks of life can only stand so much criticism when they do their jobs, or need to be recognized for their value or contributions to society. When such acts of decadence leaks inward to affect the common man, then the little things begin to build incrementally until it reaches the point of critical mass.\nTodd Phillips captured this brilliantly. The music was an incredible match using the early era of the seventies and eighties as a catalyst to the Joker's rise to fame. It helped his madness, it helped mould his persona into the devious creature that helped purge out the elite to their own wasteland while at the same time, had given birth to the Batman. This was an incredible movie, from start to finish. Lots of emotional turmoil, sadness, mind bending plots as to why Arthur plunged into the abyss of chaos. I recommend this film to all fans of the Joker franchise. It doesn't hold a lot of violence, but when it's needed, Phillips delivered perfectly to balance the story's theme.",

    "reviewBody": "I can see how Warner Brothers would greenlight something like this in a heartbeat. And it was a box-office smash, so I guess they made the right decision. It's just that Joker is about as shallow as the pitch that must have been used to sell it.Take Joaquin Phoenix put him in a Taxi Driver world, give him a weird mom like Requiem for a Dream. Have the psycho want to be a comedian like King of Comedy. Ooh, ooh let's get DeNiro to play the Johnny Carson part. That'll be clever even though DeNiro is totally wrong for it. And do some kind of Bernie Goetz-but different! And have some kind of V for Vendetta-style revolution where everybody wears clown masks. Freaky huh?The picture goes about connecting these dots dutifully, accompanied by a two note kettle drum score that represents Arthur getting beaten down deeper and deeper. It also beats on the audience. There are several sequences that are apparently Arthur's daydreams and others that seem like daydreams but apparently aren't. These serve to break up the A to B to C plot and confuse the audience. The uprising happens because the whole town was celebrating a triple murder. But I guess they were protesting income inequality or something. Didn't make sense to me, but I am not part of the 16-34 male, superhero-movie-fan audience that this offering was aimed at.I watched to see Joaquin Phoenix chew the scenery. And for the 70s sets and cinematography, which were really good. But that's about all I got out of it. I feel old.",

    "reviewBody": "Phoenix's finest work so far. I'm amazed how he managed to get so immersed into a deeply convoluted character. We didn't get soda or popcorn and all the same none of it would've been touched. Phoenix has a rare actor's ability to capture your entire attention with his stage presence, he's extremely versatile in his choice of roles and in the Joker in particular he flexes those talented muscles. To be able to convey complex emotions in a short period of time is so awe inspiring, huge credit to Phoenix he certainly did his homework and more so. I read somewhere that he read political biographies to get into the mindset of the Joker and I gotta say I admire his work ethic.\nI was on the edge on my seat giggling, wondering, crying and gasping throughout the film.There's a fair amount of graphic violence in the movie and despite some critics saying it glamorizes the violent culture, first of all this is fictional and rational audience members ought to be able to put that aside when going back into the real world, second of all the Arthur is a product of a dehumanizing society and a horrible childhood. Hurt people, hurt people that's something we can learn from when rehabilitating criminals. We certainly feel lots of empathy for Arthur despite his criminal doings he's a traumatised human being, strip away all the makeup and the cursing and the guns there's a person beneath longing to be accepted and loved for who he is.\nThe only thing I missed from this movie was a bit more, it didn't feel like two hours at all, that's how good it was. 9 big stars from me.

    "reviewTitle": "JOKER - IT'S ON YOU.",
    "reviewBody": "Parisians love movies. As I walk around the city, I see hundreds of movie theatres with all kinds of movies playing. Today, I decided to look at a big, multiplex movie theatre that is right around the corner from where I am staying, UGC CINÉ CITÉ LES HALLES - would you believe it is showing 46 films on 27 separate screens?When you go to a French movie and you speak as little Frecnh as I do, you'll need to go see an American or English movie that is NOT dubbed but rather sub-titled. France has acronyms that describe what you will see -VO stands for Version Originale, or the original version of the film with French subtitles for audiences that do not understand the native language of the film.VF stands for Version Française, meaning that it is the French version of the film which has been dubbed with French audio - no subtitles.VOSTFR stands for Version Originale Sous-Titrée en FRançais, meaning that it is the original version of a film with subtitles in French.Finally, the term VOST stands for Version Originale Sous-Titrée, or the original version of a film with subtitles in the film's original language.Most American films are dubbed in France and it is strange to hear the voices since they are nothing like the actor's real voice.I saw Joker at a packed house. The audience was much more quiet than an American one. But, first, let me answer the question I know you are asking yourself - and the answer is Yes, they sell popcorn and it's good, but you'll have to first answer the BIG question when you order - sweet or sour? Sweet? Sour? I answered - sel, seulemont (salt only). The young woman was incredulous, but gave me my popcorn.The most important thing about the movie you should know is that Joker is not about the Joker you and I and the rest of the world associate with Batman. This Joker is the Joker who became that Joker. Yes, eventually, he commits crimes but they are the ordinary crimes that most non-supervillains commit.This Joker, played with wild abandon by Joaquin Phoenix, is a mommy's boy who has delusions of being normal. He lives in a city that resembles New York City in the 1970s. If you weren't there, it was a garbage-strewn, graffiti-emblazoned mess. Arthur Fleck, Joker's real name, is a clown who plays at childrens' parties. One day, he loses his job (the reason is silly) and discovers that his much-adored mother (Frances Conroy) may be as crazy and delusional as he is. Along the way, the film takes potshots at cutting the funding for mentally ill people - anyway, it's a really bad day and Arthur snaps.One of his heroes is a Tonight-like show's host, Murray Franklin, played unconvincingly by Robert DeNiro. I think that is the first time I used that word to describe a DeNiro performance, but his totally stiff appearance makes his being cast as a Johnny Carson-ish character one of the greatest miscastings in the history of the movies. I mean, DeNiro would be better cast as Robin Hood or Cary Grant. Add the miscasting to the fact that the character is totally unappealing and you have hit the movie disaster jackpot.Arthur longs to be a stand-up comic and make people laugh. His mother, may or may not have had Arthur during an affair with Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) - and there's your Batman connection.Joker is one of the most evil films I have ever seen. I know that seems a strange word to use, but this movie cynically uses the depressingly wide gap between the haves and have-nots in America to act as a backdrop to a story that has no purpose other than to make us wince and squirm. Director/co-writer Todd Philips' most famous contribution to cinema has been the Hangover series. His writing partner, Scott Silver's last movie, The Finest Hours, lost $50,000,000.00 in the US. Hollywood studio heads, if you don't understand the anger of female writers and directors in Hollywood, take another look at Scott Silver. Yes, he was nominated for an Oscar for The Fighter, but there were three other writers on that script. Seventeen years ago, he wrote a hit movie, 8 Mile. Since then he has done nothing of note, yet here he is co-writing a big-budget movie and making a mess of it.I emphasis the creators because this is one of the most poorly written scripts I have even seen made into a big-budget movie and I have seen some doozies. This is a movie that made me run home to shower. It is such an ugly look at the world that there is nothing at all that is redeeming about it. The most shocking moment is when we see Mr. Phoenix in his underwear - he looks seriously ill, almost malnourished. And his excesses don't stop there - his is one of the most undisciplined performances I have ever seen.I have to mention the score because it is as bad as the rest of the movie. Written by Hildur Gudnadottir, it stops and starts and then disappears then BANG! BOP! Then it's just gone. Two words came to mind when it was over - thank god.Joker is a world-wide hit. Some would argue that is the proverbial bottom line - who cares that it's not only junk, but evil junk, lots of people have gone to see it. Lots of people, in the past, have gone to hangings, beheadings, bear baitings and public burnings too. I am certain most people went to see Joker thinking they were going to see the Batman franchise Joker who had been played thrillingly by Jared Leto, Heath Ledger, Caesar Romero and Jack Nicholson. Well, the joke is on them. Us. Me. You.",

    "reviewBody": "I'm speechless. This is one of my favorite movies , and it's the best. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Yes, I think he should absolutely win an Oscar for his portrayal as the iconic character. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin is pretty close to the level of Ledger. Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job directing, I think this is his best work to date. Robert De Niro is not given much screen time, but he takes advantage of the time he's given, and he shines. The costume design and makeup is great as well, and I think it should be nominated for a major award. The script is incredible, I'm going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days. The violence in this movie was not even that bad, compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy. I would like to take a minute and say, that films and other media do not cause violence, this is not a \"dangerous film.\" The last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane, I won't be able to forget them. The death scene on the Murray Franklin Show, is absolutely crazy, and I did not see it coming. Despite the fact that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mass murderer, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character at times. I didn't forgive him for the things he did, but at the same time, I did sympathize with him. I really liked the progression of Arthur's character. You see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by. The runtime was perfect it never felt boring. I loved this movie, and there's so much more I want to talk about.",

    "reviewBody": "Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.",

    "reviewTitle": "The other side of a pretty dark coin",
    "reviewBody": "Well, this was certainly quite an anticipated movie, and just to think that it was made by the guy that came up with The Hangover. Then again this film is certainly not a pleasant movie by no means, but that certainly does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Yeah, it is meant to make you feel really uncomfortable, and in a way you sort of also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character. In a way, by the end of the film, I am really wanting him to actually become the Joker, though of course this is all left in Limbo with the way the ending actually comes about.One thing I have to say is that Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding. I remember people suggesting that nobody could ever top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, and of course there was Jared Leno who came along with Suicide Squad, yet Joaquin Phoenix truly moves this character to a completely new level. Yeah, we all suspected that the Joker was crazy, but the way Phoenix captures the dark insanity of the character, the way he captures his mental illness, is absolutely outstanding.Thus, what begs the question is, could he actually be the Joker that we all know and love (and if it wasn't for the fact that the Joker is a much loved villain we wouldn't have got this movie - in fact I'm not at all sure if there is any other villian out there that could literally have a movie of their own). The reason I say this is because Phoenix's Joker is seriously disabled, yet when we encounter the Joker elsewhere, while he might pretend to be crazy, he all know that he has his wits about him.The thing is that I don't believe that Phoenix's Joker could actually be the 'clown-prince of crime' because, well, I'm not entirely sure whether he is actually capable of interacting with people, let alone being the calculating criminal that he is famous for. The reason is that he really doesn't seem to be capable of being able to interact with people. In fact, he is more of a symbol, this is something that slowly becomes relevant as the movie progresses, until we get to the end. Of course, the ending is very ambiguous, and some of the suggestions that he is a joker as opposed to The Joker, really doesn't sit with me all that well.However, in a way it sort of makes sense, him being a symbol and all that. One suggestion, and it is a suggestion that I sort can agree with, is that he actually died in the car crash (something that isn't all that surprising considering he was hit by an ambulance on the side of the car in which he was sitting), and the crowds removed him carefully, as if he was some sort of martyr. Sure, the final scene certainly doesn't suggest that he is in heaven or anything, but the thing is that many characters literally take on a force of personality, one in which the actual person could never fulfill, and Arthur is certainly no leader, not in that sense of the word, and as such he can really only exist as a symbol.Yet we must remember that there is so much about this film that we simply do not know what is truth and what is hallucination. The thing is that Arthur is seriously disconnected from reality, that becomes pretty clear with the 'relationship' that he has with the woman down the hallway. Yeah, once that becomes clear, and it should not have been any surprise as all, it really throws into a lot of doubts what is actually happening, what is real and what is not. Then again, there are a lot of scenes going on in the background, which do give us hints that there certainly is a reality that is unfolding, which means that he certainly did kill the three men on the subway, and murdered Murray live on national television.Yet even Thomas Wayne, a character that is certainly not held in such high regard in this film, has an ambiguous side to him. Then again, in the other Batman films, we see so little of the character that he is seen as some angelic figure. Yet in this film, once again, the truth, and the reality, are two completely different things. Still, the whole question of whether he did have an affair with Arthur's mother, and that Arthur is actually his illegitimate son, is certainly thrown into a lot of doubt.So, yeah, this is a pretty awesome film, and it is certainly one of those films that is going to leave you thinking and trying to understand it for quite a while after leaving the cinema. Honestly, it is pretty good that we are starting to see more of these movies come into the cinema now, after a very long drought full of a bunch of quite sub-par action flicks.",

    "reviewBody": "The movie Joker centers around a man Arthur Fleck who is disregarded by society. The actor Joaquin Phoenix who portrays the character is phenomenal and definitely the best Joker after Heath Ledger. Joaquin Phoenix should definitely win an Oscar for his performance as Arthur Fleck aka Joker. This movie makes you actually sympathize with the Joker character and look at him differently. It is not surprising that this movie was well received by the audience and got mostly positive reviews from critics.How this movie plays out is not traditional. It is a character study of Arthur Fleck also known as Joker. The movie is set in the past where Bruce Wayne is a young boy and both of his parents are still alive. Arthur Fleck was the main protagonist and antagonist of the movie. He had a scene with Bruce Wayne and confronted Alfred. In this universe, Arthur Fleck was adopted by Penny Fleck and she saw how people abused him. It was quite shocking that Arthur Fleck may have been Thomas Wayne's illegitimate child, but that rumor turned out to be false.Joker is a terrifying and tragic story about Arthur Fleck who had a traumatizing experience growing up and was abused due to his mental state and his abnormal laughing condition. The movie is a definite must watch for Joker fans who loved Heath Ledger as the Joker in the Dark Knight.",

    "reviewBody": "I went in the movie expecting a basic/ straight forward origin story of the joker and how he would fit in the Gotham of this Universe. But I got something else, an experience like never before from a comic book film. After the first watch I couldn't grasp everything, but after watching it for the third time, there are so many things happening that you would not even think of are happening, or ask yourself are they even real? The more you watch this film the more it grows on you, makes you think about the reality. The movie doesn't end on a straight forward conclusion, but keeps the mystery intact, and is open to interpretation. My take on this one is that, this movie is not about the joker which we know from the comics and live action movies, but it's about a man who impregnated this chaos in Gotham which led to hundreds of followers from which the real joker was born who became the arch nemesis of the batman. Joker is not about who is behind the mask but about the chaos which still passes down and is beyond his death.",

    "reviewBody": "Joker\n2019\n15\ndirector : Todd Phillips\nstarring: Joaquin phoenix,Robert de niro, Zaze beetz,Frances Conray,Brett Cullenoverall rating 99/100The joker is about mentally unstable Arthur Fleck ( Joaquin phoenix) on trying to reach his dream of becoming a stand up comedian. But when things in his life dont go his way and his mental health deteriorates the joker clown is unleashed.Wow this movie was a masterpiece in every component i never thought my favourite movie of the year would be a DC movie but this film really shocked me at its artistry and brilliance lets talk about why this is.First of all the film had an absolutely incredible score. Wow the soundtrack really left an impact in the most important scenes in the film. When there was something uncomfortable or important happening on the screen the score got louder and louder. And i especially enjoyed the score when Joaquian phoenix became the complete joker. It made you excited for what he was going to do and added important to the final act.Next the film was actually pretty funny. Some of the comedy jokes within the film mostly landed. And Robert de niro added excellent comedic moments to the movie as well as his fantastic acting. His sarcastic comments definitely drew some laughs from me despite him suffering the repercussions of making these jokes about Arthurs character i just thought he added a nice dynamic to the movie.Next i thought the movie had excellent character development for the lead role and the female character (Zaze Beetz) was a great addition to the movie as well. I thought Zazes character did a really good job with what little screen time she had. She kind of was the main reason for Arthur not going completely insane for half of the movie and if she wasn't a character he would of went mad much more quickly. Next Arthurs character development was fantastic. To see his slow decent into madness throughout the film really left an impact with me. So many things in his life was going wrong that from my perspective i understood why he snapped. From losing his job to realising dark secrets about his mum it was really interesting to see how his mental health slowly got worse and worse.Next the plot twist and final act were fantastic and definitely the best parts of the movie aside from Joaquin phoenix being fantastic. I thought the plot twist of Sophie never actually being beside Arthur was a really interesting twist. As she was keeping him relatively sane throughout the movie but with this twist it just proves he was mad all along so that was great. And the final act was just fantastic when Arthur transformed completely into the joker it was just fantastic. He had a fantastic script he looked fantastic and terryfying and the events left me satisfied with the ending. The gore also added a lot of impact to a lot of the scenes and added a fatality realistic portrayal of violence in modern society.Next the film had an excellent balance between sympathy and fear of Arthurs character. With all the events that was happening to him at the beginning and the fact that he couldn't control his laughing to it being a condition you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. But this sympathy soon turned to fear of what he is capable off when he is off his medication and the film did a brilliant job of balancing these two out therefore being tonally consistent. Adding onto that the film executed an incredible tense and uncomfortable tone throughout. Wow this film had you on edge throughout. Whether it was the haunting laugh of Arthur. Or his disformed body. The film really put you in a place of discomfort which i loved as that was i believe the directors desired passive reaction for the audience.Next the cinematography and visuals were stunning. There was some really stunning shots in this film largely close ups of the joker that really were fantastic to look at. The films colour palette was fantastic as well it was just a very well shot and directed movie.Now next is not a negative more like a realisation. Now i understand why this film is causing some controversy in some aspects but a lot of people are taking it to far. I can see how it can be taken the wrong way in terms of supporting violence and anybody who watches the film in a similar situation to Arthur may take the film very literally but in my opinion this was not the films main goal. As i believe it a more harsh and realistic portrayal of how dangerous modern society is and this themes was portrayed excellently. And really made me think and question about how mad and dangerous society and the whole world is in this day and age.Now for my final two positives. Firstly i loved that they involved young batman in this story. His interactions with the joker was fantastic and it saddened me that they wont meet again on screen. And seeing his parents deaths again was sad to see but also bought back nostalgia from previous batman movies.And finally the best part of this film was of course Joaquin Phoenix. Wow he was truly incredible here. He really put every escene of his being into making his interpretation of the joker his own. And boy did he do a good job. He found a way to differentiate himself from all the other portrayals and matches the legendary performance of Heath Ledger. He was commited to the role and clearly lost a lot of weight. And his acting was the reason the film had such a uncomfortable tone as it was so believable. You could see the madness in his eyes and that intensity and madness got more and more recognisable as the movie went on he definitely deserves at least an oscar nomination but really a win for this.Overall the joker is a true cinematic masterpiece that is pretty much perfect. Filled with excellent performances/themes and visuals and it really proves that the standard of DC movies is improving rapidly.",

    "reviewBody": "I had to give at least one star for Phoenix's performance (it's great even if it...is a little heavy handed?) but the whole of this movie is sadly not worth the ELEVEN!!!! Oscar nominations it got. It may not be fair to compare Phoenix's Joker with Heath Ledger's now-iconic one, so I think it's more important to focus on the movie itself.The Joker is a lazy film that spends most of its runtime trying to make the audience understand why a man would become the classically unhinged and maniacal DC villain (while taking a note from Nolan's book and creating this movie in a world that seems pretty much detached from the rest of the DC cinematic universe.)That sounds great! The premise itself has tons of potential to be compelling and disturbing. Instead, we are given a series of scenes in which Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) is either degraded by his coworkers and strangers or getting kindly rejected by women (there is a reason why people have referred to this as an \"Incel movie\"...). We also learn he has had a troubled childhood. At no point in this movie is there a moment I feel genuine empathy for the Joker. I say this because \"humanizing the famous JOKER\" seems to be the the overarching goal of the film, to the very end where our Joker leads chaotic riots through the streets after murdering Robert Di Nero on live television.Ultimately, I think one of the least-necessary movies in 2019 is one focused on empathizing with a troubled white adult man who was mistreated by society and rejected by women until he snapped and killed everyone...If you think this is a too simplistic reception of this movie and Todd Phillips's Joker depiction, ask yourself.l: what value does this movie bring? What conversation is it trying to have? What themes is it contending with? When we boil things down, Arthur Fleck is a straight white dude who had a very crappy, psychologically traumatic life. And then he killed a person. Then several more. He may have even killed that very nice neighbor of his (Zazie Beetz! Deserved better!) and her son, though it is never explicitly shown.What, then, is the message of this movie? I am skeptical of any depiction of a character like Arthur Fleck that is more interested in displaying a few instances of him being mistreated by people rather than interrogating him and the society that made him.",

I understand what the movie is trying to point out, but it would have worked for me if it was not connected to the joker or dc comics. The Joker is a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind, so much of a genius Batman is the only one who can match him. This \"origin\" story does not create a Joker that could ever hope to be Batman's greatest enemy. He causes mass chaos in the city by mistake. A very slow burn for a very weak payoff, the ending should have been in the middle of the movie and gone from there. His makeup is that of a clown the entire movie never bearing any resemblance to any Joker i've ever seen. I can't enjoy a character who is ONLY a mental case, he is terrible at being funny, Heath Ledger's joker was hilarious without trying to be a comedian, he was funny in the moment, this Joker is too disturbed for comedy. A character like the Joker doesn't need an origin story it should be left shrouded in mystery. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job with what it all was, but it felt more like Taxi than anything else which to some is a success but I feel it's a failure in this case.",

    "reviewTitle": "JOKER - Anatomy of Psycho-Dramatic Rise of \"Phoenix\"",
    "reviewBody": "A lanky Caucasian man, sitting in front of a make-up table painting his face white. Through his pondering eyes rolls a tear, smudging his mascara, while he pulls his mouth wide as if forcing a smile. Meet Arthur Fleck, a 30-something impoverished party-clown who's still mentally recuperating after years in the asylum.With a neurological disorder of uncontrollable laughter citing his traumatic childhood, Fleck struggles every day to make ends meet with futile attempts to tackle bullying in public and taking care of a delusional mother at home. Set in the 80's Gotham, where a worker's strike lead to city-wide garbage congestion and thus, rise in the anti-establishment views at large. Both of the above circumstances foreshadow the inevitable.\nAnd then, a cataclysmic event by a desperate act of self-defence pushes our helpless clown over the edge. We see Fleck in makeup breaking into a slow-ballet and sashay to his music, wrapped in a calming trance of his own inner turmoil. We know it then, for sure, that our villain has arrived.Having said so, JOKER doesn't overcook the rhymes and reasons but is a textbook on the anatomy of a psychopath. It is well-structured, moderately paced with a compelling character-origin story. Director Todd Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher (\"The Hangover\", \"War Dogs\") create an enigma of sorts amidst tight close-ups over the ominous grave themes in cello by upcoming composer Hildur Guðnadóttir (\"Chernobyl\") - all in a harmony. They make Fleck's circumstantial actions seem so justified that it's hard not to feel for him - even when he does things because he can.Been spoken about those influential comparisons with prior inspirations, such as - \"The Man Who Laughs\" (a 1928 Victor Hugo novel's adaptation), or \"King of Comedy\" (Martin Scorsese's 1983 dark-comedy, also starring De Niro, who plays a pivotal role here); the one with Jack Nicholson (1989) or, the most remembered \"THE Heath Ledger's portrayal\" (Christopher Nolan's 2008 \"The Dark Knight\") - all seem justified. However, just like the latter did for 'Batman', this film does for the psychotic super-villain - viz. \"to make it incredibly more human\".And, who else could have done it better than Joaquin Phoenix? Much like some previous performances - \"Walk the Line\", \"Her\" - his portrayal is rhythmically alarming, comical, self-driven and empathetic that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it among the finest screen-acting in the last few decades. Embodying Arthur Fleck and his personality's grim deterioration are imploring enough to search for something personal in those exhausting cackles, painful failures and delusions of grandeur, humiliations, the agony of being overlooked and stepped-over. Hence, it feels triumphant when the retaliation comes through a cacophony of riots as the Joker rises with a wide smile, unforced and natural this time.So, until we have reservations with the portrayal of mental illness and violence on-screen, please don't miss this rare gem of a psychological-drama. We may have the last laugh with this one.Hypnotic and near brilliant!\n(8.75/10)",

    "reviewTitle": "I have got to start ignoring the hoopla about \"controversial\" films.",
    "reviewBody": "Just watched \"Joker\" and I realized I have got to start ignoring criticisms around \"controversial\" films. Like Jojo Rabbit, Joker was getting criticized for things that have nothing to do with what is on the screen. I was hesitant about it because after some reviews I imagined it would be full of the moral relativism that imo, tainted Zac Snyder's \"Watchmen\", (and which HBO recently corrected.) But Joker is magnificent. What some were calling nihilism, I saw as a warning. Like the \"joke\" Phoenix tells DiNero before a critical moment: \"What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?\"... What you deserve.\". That single line encapsulates the fundamental theme of the film. Wonderfully acted and directed. Dark, yes, very dark... and unrelenting about that. But it's beautifully subversive. Not nihilistic. There's a difference. I think it's on par with V For Vendetta in that regard. Sort of V meets Travis Bickle. It's a great continuation of the trend of deconstruction of superhero archetypes. I particularly loved the re-framing of Thomas Wayne from the comic's heroic billionaire philanthropist, into a Bloomberg-esque entitled mayoral wanna-be with a mouth full of the standard trickle-down nonsense. And I must admit Joaquin Phoenix truly does deserve best lead actor. He is truly captivating and frightening. The direction, editing, superb. The ironic use of music didn't come off as trite or manipulative as, imo, it did in Scorsese, Irishman. To be honest, I am still biased towards 'Jojo Rabbit' for best picture. That film is closer to my heart. But Joker is a powerful piece of work, and I won't see it as a crime if it wins. (If Once Upon A Time in Hollywood or The Irishman take the trophy, I would see that as a rip off because both are overrated, imo. Good, meticulous and all that... but overrated.)",

    "reviewBody": "I feel the best movies are complex and make you feel a range of emotions such as love, empathy, pity, joy, hatred, etc. The joker I found to be a series of unbelievable cliches . So the joker is poor and has some menial jobs and everyone in society is mean and abusive to him including his mother. I did feel sorry for him but at the same tine it shows his mental issues probably keep him from living a normal life. I did feel empathy for his plight but I didn't feel that society would get behind him as a \"hero\" for killing 3 people randomly on a subway. Also I found it ridiculous when the mob attacked the cops as if everyone in society hates cops. It was a trite Hollywood take on rich people are mean and awful to people who are poor (which I find hilarious given that everyone in Hollywood IS rich) . It was unrealistic from many angles and I wished I hadn't wasted my time watching it.",

    "reviewBody": "One of the things I found most memorable was the transformation of Joaquin Phoenix---the story isn't about a comic book villain, but a real person with a serious illness. All during the movie we see how life is for him--a horror of humiliation and fear. He trudges thru life (to get to his seedy apartment, he has to climb steep cement stairs. ) In his transformation into 'Joker', we can feel his sense of triumph as he descends those same stairs---Joaquin is unrecognizable in this new identity. This movie has hit some kind of nerve. So far, no violent imitators, just big numbers at the box office. In NYC, those stairs have become a tourist attraction.",

    "reviewTitle": "Completely Unique!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "An awful lot has been talked about this film even before it hit cinemas. From the triumphs at the film festivals to the backlash surrounding the subject matter of the film. There hasn't been a film in quiet like it in some time that has brought up such emotion/controversy in the public eye. Not gonna lie I was anticipating this film as soon as it was announced...........it was really fascinating to me as to why on earth Warner Bros. thought that audiences needed/wanted a Joker \"solo/origin\" film. There had to be something special about it........................my god is there something special about this film. It is truly unique not just as a comic book film but just as a film. Its more a psychological thriller than a comic book film.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic actor no-one can take that away from him, even before witnessing his performance in this film, the man is a truly great actor anyway. Wow just wow............I didn't think it was humanly possible that anyone could embody the character of the \"Joker\" quiet like Heath Ledger did over a decade ago....but wow does Phoenix come very very close. (I know you shouldn't compare......because its not fair on either performance...........there both fantastic in there own right). Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck is pretty much your every day person at the start, however its witnessing the terrible decline in one mans journey that is truly horrifying. I'm gonna say it he deserves at least an Oscar nomination...if not more. Takes your breath away.There are so many story elements to this film that just hit the nail right on the head, firstly the misdirection of Thomas Wayne being Arthur Flecks father is fantastic.....a really interesting angle however it is quickly super-seeded by the fact that Flecks mother was mentally unwell and made the whole thing up.....also whilst in the process uncovering that Fleck was adopted. His complete hallucination of Zazie Beetz character being involved with him, is done so so well, it only dawns on you at the final moment that it was a figment of his imagination........the figment being a really normal life. Mind blown!!!!!!!!!! All of which has such emotion and punch especially on Arthur........who is unwell, but that is slightly put upon him by the society that he inhabits. The culture of isolationism within Gotham City only fuels the fire raging inside Fleck waiting for the right moment to appear.......and boy it does.On to the controversy surrounding the film. My own personally opinion, anyone reading this is perfectly entitled to disagree, there is no controversy with this film at all. I believe the reason for people feeling uncomfortable with this film is because it shows a true representation of what would happen to a man like this.......and more importantly that it could happen in real life today. With the society we live in today in 2019, it is plausible what happens on screen could become reality to a certain degree. Thats the part, I think, that horrifies people. Its definitely not glorifying violence, this is not a tremendously violent film...it has its moments here and there. There are plenty more violent films that have been made and are going to be made. What this film does glorify is the stigma attached to class status and mental health illnesses, however its trying to open your eyes. The film is trying to make you look in the mirror and show you that this is our society really, that Gotham City and Arthur Fleck could be replaced by anyone and anywhere if we don't look at these societal problems. Thats what I think anyway.Final positive the score is out of this world. I know this sounds very snobby thing to say but the score really does inhabit an added character to the film........it is truly horrifying. Oscar nod 100%.Overall this film is great....I definitely need to see it again, it needs a deserves a second viewing to really understand and appreciate everything. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10. Fantastic, real eye opening story, mind blowing performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Must also mention great directing from Todd Phillips.......the guy that did \"The Hangover\" did this.........wow. Even if your not a comic book film fan you must see this because this is least comic-booky film your ever going to see, \"King of Comedy\" meets \"Taxi Driver\".",

    "reviewTitle": "Probably one of the best comic book movies out there with a performance of Phoenix that will make you speechless at the end #Venice76",
    "reviewBody": "Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.\nBut still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\nI'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76",

Interesting but slightly bloated origin story of the arch criminal villain of The DC universe with Phoenix at the top of his game as the much-put-upon Arthur Fleck in Gotham City circa 1981 who reaches his breaking point and a moment of clarity of what his true significant purpose is in life with deadly consequences ensuing. While director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver) attempts to get in touch with his inner Scorsese by paralleling his worldview ala Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin (going full meta in even employing De Niro as talk-show host Murray Franklin) with far too many touchstones to count. Phoenix's chameleon-like physicality (shedding over 50 pounds) to give the slightly anemic/skeletal protagonist its spine by tapping into his own Christian Bale ala THE MECHANIC and his eerie, off-settling helpless cackle becomes instantly iconic in the canon of actors who've portrayed this homicidal harlequin.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Joker of all will knock your sox off",
    "reviewBody": "The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a \"comic book film\". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.\nBasically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as \"The Joker\", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a \"condition\" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three \"respectable\" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian \"Arthur Fleck \" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is \"I have a condition\" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense.",

And Joaquin Phoenix is an incredible actor.\"After a few days to ponder it, I now view it a tremendous movie. It works on so many levels: The transformation of a mentally ill man to someone who is criminally insane. A dark origin film that takes Arthur Fleck, in an otherwise ordinary tale of woe, on an unlikely path to an eventual arch-villain whose unhinged randomness is his greatest weapon. And that transformation is not quite complete in this film, leaving room for moreThe cinemtography is ugly (in a great way) and sets the dark mood. The plot and the script do a great job of making Arthur's tortured existence palpable and sympathetic. Phoenix's physical performance is unbelievably good. Never felt so sorry for such a creepy persona. He's like a car wreck you can't look away from.Highly recommended. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go with this.",

    "reviewTitle": "A fantastic, smart slice of cinema with a lot to say",
    "reviewBody": "I'll be honest, I was avoiding seeing \"Joker\".At first it seemed to me that it was going to be yet another comic book movie in a cinematic landscape saturated to bursting point with bland comic book movies.Then I was a little fed up with the constant tiresome media spam the film was getting because it was so \"controversial\". These events conspired to make me feel less than enthusiastic about watching it.Well, two days ago I changed my mind, put it on and the rest is history.Joker is a phenomenal film. It's such an intriguing in-depth study of mental illness, social inequity and the inability of people of different social classes to understand each other that I was really quite blown away. It's a movie that has far more in common with classic intelligent cinema than modern day CGI-loaded blockbusters.Following mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck, the movie chronicles his heart-wrenching descent into sociopathic villainy, catalysed by the decaying and uncaring social environment of Gotham City.Joaquin Phoenix does a brilliant job here, honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. Arthur can be defined most reliably by one word: \"Pain\".Arthur's entire existence is emotional pain. Almost everyone he meets treats him like garbage. Those who do not treat him poorly still cannot even begin to understand his struggle with mental illness.When he bursts out in sheer frustration to one character, voice cracking, with the line \"I don't know why everyone is so rude? I don't know why you are? I don't want anything from you!\" it hurts, because we've seen the way Arthur is treated and it's absolutely true.Yet at the same time, Arthur's point of view is unreliable and inaccurate. We can understand *why* people treat him poorly - because he is creepy and eccentric without realising. This leads to a masterful dramatic situation in which we completely empathise with Arthur's pain but also understand precisely why this pain becomes a perpetual loop.When Arthur's final singular comfort, his love for his mother, is brutally stripped from him, the end result is one of the most heart-breaking scenes I've seen in a film.The film's pace is slow but with good reason. I was becoming restless with the misery of the first half of the movie, but the final half (and especially the final act) builds to an enormous climax that justifies every ounce of build up that preceded it.My favourite scene in the whole movie is perhaps the most iconic - Arthur in his full \"Joker\" regalia, dancing down the same steps he has struggled to climb up repeatedly throughout the film.This scene works on so many levels to highlight the most horrifying aspect of the film - Arthur's mental salvation, his total liberation, in the end does not come from positivity. It does not come, as in the case of a \"coming of age\" movie, from fixing his problems and becoming happy.No, Arthur's charisma, happiness and total lack of concern in his new persona comes from suicidal ideation and a complete lack of care for anything. His problems finally break his sanity completely, to the point where happiness and sadness don't mean anything to him anymore. The man dancing merrily down the steps has lost his soul, and he's smiling about it.I won't say anymore about the film for risk of spoiling it for those who have not seen it. But I will end this review by saying that the entire hysterical media response to this movie and how it will \"encourage violence\" is utter nonsense.Joker has the complete opposite message: understand the people around you. Show them compassion, even if they seem unworthy of it on the surface. Don't judge others based on their social status or what you see on TV. And above all, realise that your opinion of others is based off your experience and limited knowledge, and isn't necessarily accurate.Perhaps that's the true reason why mass media outlets dislike this film. Because it encourages developing the virtues the modern reactionary media seems to lack.",

    "reviewBody": "Well, I didn't like that they changed the origin story of the main character, and within that, the origin story of Batman. I liked the originals. And, for one and a half hours, this film felt like it was \"beating a dead horse\" - Arthur is mentally ill, in a desperate time, with no more social services. And he's slipping into madness. Pause, repeat, repeat, for nearly 90 minutes. It's dark and traumatic, but its also boring, at that length. Phoenix does a good job of it, sort of combining Buffalo Bill from \"Silence of Lambs\" with the emaciated body of Trevor Reznik from \"The Machinist\", and to good effect, but no one could have kept that up in an interesting manner for that long.The last half hour is better, and lays a solid foundation for how the Joker gains power, almost despite himself. His look, and his laugh, turn more to the classic version of the character and has more of the feel of the Joker I grew up with. But, I don't know that I'd watch this again, and certainly not as often as I've re-watched \"The Dark Knight\" since it came out. This almost might have been a better movie if it wasn't about the Joker at all, and just about some how some crazy man came to be and came to power. Knock, knock...",

Lightly mixing in the Batman wasn't really necessary either. It's pretty on the nose with its message about mental health issues, the system, class division, etc..Rental at best.",

    "reviewTitle": "Troubling, dark, engrossing",
    "reviewBody": "Was never into the whole comic book thing (the last Batman I saw was played by Michael Keaton) but this film was sold to me on the basis that it's more a portrayal of one man's descent into madness than a CGI-fuelled superhero adventure.Comparisons with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy certainly helped (not to mention the presence of the star of both of those films, Robert De Niro), as well as the leading man, an actor of whom I'm quickly becoming a devoted fan, Joaquin Phoenix. With all this considered, I armed myself with the extremely scant knowledge of the Batman universe that I possess and off to the pictures I went.Well, what I and the packed cinema saw was an acting tour de force. I never saw Heath Ledger's legendary portrayal of the titular character but I really don't know how it can beat Phoenix's portrayal here. Admittedly, I think I'm right in saying that Ledger portrayed Joker whereas for most of this film, Phoenix is portraying Arthur Fleck and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. There's no denying that Joker is an intensely interesting character but for me, seeing the human behind the face-paint and his tumultuous unravelling is far more fascinating than the monster he becomes.Much has been made of how dark this film is and that is certainly true; how it is a 15 certificate is more a sign of the times than anything because this film pulls no punches. The violence is, at times, extremely graphic and the portrayal of a man so troubled is often deeply unsettling. All of which, set against a relentlessly grim Gotham backdrop, is utterly necessary to give the film the atmosphere and the feel it requires but I did wonder how this film will sit in a franchise that, while not explicitly aimed at kids, nevertheless appeals to younger audiences the way Batman always has. 'The Dark Knight Rises' was a 12A; Joker should really be an 18 and trust me, you really don't want to be taking your kids to see it if you want them to get a good night's sleep afterwards.What isn't in any doubt is the extraordinary performance Joaquin Phoenix delivers in the title role. He has always been a very dependable actor and has given some incredible performances over the years ('Walk The Line' and 'You Were Never Really Here' to name but two) but here, one gets the sense that he is throwing absolutely everything he has at the role. As well as a physical transformation (he clearly lost an awful lot of weight to attain the skeletal physique required), Phoenix brings a manic intensity to the part that is, at times, hugely uncomfortable to watch but is never anything less than utterly fascinating and absorbing.It is unnerving because even for someone like me who has such a flimsy knowledge of the Batman story, there is a strange contradiction in the sadness and pity felt for a character who one knows is going to become one of pop culture's great supervillains; a murderous madman who will come to thrive on anarchy, violence, death and destruction. For most of the film though, he isn't Joker, he is Arthur Fleck, a sympathetic character exposed to the violence, the mockery and the ostracisation that those on the edge of society suffer all too often. With what's thrown at him, it is no wonder that he eventually snaps and fights back in the most spectacular and public way.I might have got even more from this film if I had any interest in the comic book world but it says a lot about Joker that I was able to watch this as a stand-alone film and leave the cinema utterly mesmerised by what I'd seen. Director Todd Phillips' vision aside though, all praise has to go to Phoenix for delivering such a pained, intense, visceral and thrilling performance. In lesser hands, it could have felt cheap and exploitative but not here. I can't say either way whether this is a sensitive portrayal of mental illness but then again, Arthur's specific condition isn't explicitly defined and also, this is a fictional character whose defining feature, his greatest weapon, is that he is \"insane\" (for want of a better word).Already, there have been debates about whether or not the portrayal is healthy and there are arguments on both sides. I don't know for sure but if nothing else, some good will surely come from increasing the spotlight on what it means to suffer from mental illness. The film itself, while set in a fictional city in an undefined timeframe, does touch upon issues that are seemingly timeless.The lack of funding or of proper care for those living with mental illness is explicitly referred to in the film and are highlighted as major factors in Arthur's continuing decline. The therapist who just repeats the same questions, the lack of funding for proper care, the constant mockery from those who don't understand; these are all daily battles waged by those living with mental illness. Of course, in reality, said sufferers very, very seldom reach a point whereby they turn violent (or indeed murderous) and wreak revenge on society. Their battle to be heard and to get proper care, however, is all too common.This is just one debate that the film will ignite but great cinema always does that and for me, 'Joker' is great cinema with a performance at its heart that surely cannot go unrewarded when Awards Season comes around. Certain scenes will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, debates will be had, lines will be quoted and meaning will be attempted to be extracted from what the viewer has seen. THAT is what only great cinema provides.8.5/10",

    "reviewTitle": "Joaquin Phoenix is hypnotic",
    "reviewBody": "The film opens with Arthur in-front of a mirror; stretching his mouth upwards into a smile, a single tear rolling down his face. This scene was extremely powerful, both for Flecks character who struggles to engage with the world, and the audience (because who hasn't masqueraded their feelings behind a smile?)Following his everyday life, we see that Arthur is treated with hostility in almost every social encounter. Jokes are made at his expense, he is sneered at by others, beaten on several occasions (I felt every kick he received) & we feel hopeless that his situation will ever improve.As we are privy to his awful treatment (alongside the notes in his journal, his relationships with others -or lack of- and his constant battle with Pseudobulbar), we are much better equipped to align ourselves with his thoughts/motives and I think this is the crowning glory of the film. In light of this, we understand his rage against Gotham/the people who ridicule him & his vengeance is justifiable.In every scene, Joaquin Phoenix is hypnotic. At times I struggled not to wince at his skeletal stature. His metamorphosis into Joker was fascinating - and I loved that he chose dance as a way to express himself. The eloquence of the bathroom scene vs his charismatic shuffling down the steps later in the film was stunning, and beautifully shot. The scene on the Murray Franklin show was genuinely exhilarating (truly showcasing Phoenix' talents) whilst also criticising a society devoid of humanity & the dishonesty of the media.Hildur Guånadóttir's cello score was sublime. Fractured & mournful, it greatly adds to the films tone, alongside 'Smile' & 'That's Life'. Joker was my favourite film of 2019 (so much so I went to the cinema on 3 separate occasions) - a masterpiece from Philips as a director (may he ditch making films like The Hangover & instead delve further into the darkness of films like Joker).Also - Arthur helping Gary when he can't reach the door lock & kissing his head...tugged at my heart strings indefinitely.",

Such a small, yet beautiful detail to addFor the people who didn't like Joker because it made them 'too uncomfortable' it means that Todd Phillips has done his job right, this film is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable, sick, on the edge of your seat, etcin conclusion: This film is perfect in every aspect, the cinematography, the lighting, the small details like the trash bags alongside Arthur when he walks on the street, showing how disgusting Gotham is, and making that symbolic to how society treats Arthur; those small, yet beautiful details really make this film beautiful. A great way to end 2019, with this masterpiece.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie made me depressed, upset, angry, empathetic, distancing and on and on. Joaquin Phoenix was superb. His performance overshadowed everyone else in the film which is unfortunate in some respect because I plan overlooked everyone and watched with amazement the performance he gave. What a fantastic journey Arthur Fleck went through.Yes I believe I recognized many of the angles of commentary watching and thinking about the movie afterwards. The strongest impression is how \"super heroes\" can be very polarizing and don't mean outcomes are always good. The other major impression was the lack of mental health assistance which we all know has had major impacts on society and even more so on the people who could be helped. This was a movie of name all the stereotypes and perceptions you can name. There are a lots.The movie had one glaring drawbacks that I believe could have been dealt with without asking forbearance by the audience as it did. When Gary witnessed the bludgeoning of Randall (wow was that intense, the interaction of the three in the scene) and the subsequent cat and mouse with Gary how do you explain that he did not run to the nearest policeman he could find. What did he do, appears nothing. This is a loose end that is glaring. Another is the pillow scene in the hospital. The movie needs a better cause and effect when it came to killing.Everything was layered when it came to mistreatment by Arthur but when Arthur was doing his thing it was action/cut move on and don't deal with the consequences. Perhaps we don't care about victims.I give it an eight. Don't get me wrong it was a good movie but for me the loose ends keep blurring my view of the movie. Is this a character study or a warning about society? I guess both. Just a little sloppy on the story line.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Academy finally gets one right",
    "reviewBody": "For a decade, I felt like the Oscars continued to overlook the truly greatest performances and films. I'm still salty that The Social Network didn't take home the Best Picture Oscar early in the decade and that neither The Conjuring (best film of 2013) nor Gone Girl (best film of 2014) barely got any, if any, major award recognition. Those movies are true masterworks, yet the Academy continues to award sentimental, forgettable drivel that no one will be re-visiting years from now. It took the entire decade of the 2010s for me to feel like the Academy got one right and they picked a good one to do it!JOKER (2019) may have gotten negative critical reviews, but thankfully, the movie-going voices were heard and the Academy seemed to go with people who pay to enjoy movies instead of the ones paid to critique them. This movie, no question in my mind, is easily one of the best films of the decade and may very well BE the best. And it came at just the right time, sneaking in at the very end. I promise, this film will hold up! People will be breaking it down and analyzing every inch and every frame for years and years to come. Who could have ever believed that when this century started, that 20 years later, one but TWO actors would take home the ultimate prize for essaying the most scrutinized and popular character in all of media history.Make no mistake, while I do truly think that Joker is a masterpiece, it stands tall on the shoulders of one of the most remarkable performances in film history, delivered by recent Best Actor Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix. Had Phoenix not taken home the grand prize, I would have conformed to the masses and threatened to riot! lol Phoenix was so spectacular, I'm re-evaluating whether or not Heath Ledger's Oscar back in 2008 was truly warranted, and Ledger wasn't even my favorite interpretation of Joker up to this point as I was way more entertained by Jack Nicholson in 1989's Batman and Cameron Monaghan in the late 2010s TV series Gotham. But Phoenix may be regarded as the culmination of all these fascinating interpretations.Set circa 1983 in Gotham City, Joker spins the tale of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix' character), a struggling comedian who works jobs as a clown around the metropolis. Arthur has a rare disorder which causes him to go into laughing fits at the most inappropriate times and that, along with having to take care of his physically and mentally incapacitated mother (superbly played by veteran Frances Conroy, who in my opinion deserved a Supporting Actress nomination), contributes to his severe shyness, lack of confidence, and social anxiety. To help him cope, every night Arthur watches a popular talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (brilliant performance by Robert DeNiro, who also deserved Oscar love as Supporting Actor). Arthur also gains a girlfriend during this story, his neighbor Sophie Drummond (well played by Zazie Beetz).Director Todd Phillips borrows heavily from Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, as the star of those movies Robert DeNiro has an important part in this one, essentially essaying a version of the Jerry Lewis character from Kind of Comedy. Much like Travis Bickle, Arthur is extremely quiet and a ticking time bomb and much like Rupert Pupkin, Arthur fancies himself a comedian and dreams of being famous and much like both characters, Arthur achieves a form of infamy in Joker.Joker is basically a 100% serious, psychological exercise, not the traditional lighthearted, by the numbers, comic book movie that's been flooding movie screens for the last 40 years. Make no mistake, I still admire entertaining comic book movies such as the Christopher Reeve Superman films, the Michael Keaton Batman films, Chris Nolan's Batman Begins, Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, but there's an obvious uniform beat to all those movies. Most of the other comic book movies aren't even worth mentioning, but at least those I mentioned have a ton of entertainment value and re-watchability.The aesthetic of Joker brilliantly captures the early 1980s without feeling like some parody or even homage to the decade. It's simply a unique tale set in a certain era and focuses on one of the most fascinating fictional characters in history. The movie didn't win Best Picture (as it should have), but at least the Academy rightfully acknowledges Phoenix's already legendary performance. When the popular phrase \"the hype is real\" was first spoken, whoever said it was definitely thinking of Joker.",

    "reviewBody": "Of the thousands of reviews already published, usually the sign that there's something worthy of the attention, here is what you need to know. It's dark, it barely has any ties to the DC Comics franchise but for a minor scene with character young Bruce Wayne, there are no big special effects nor elaborate action scenes; that's it for the \"not in this movie\". What it does have is great character development, a storyline you'd find in any great tragedy novel, opera, play and of course movie, and superb acting for the lead character, Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix.I try not to copy from my web friend's reviews, but sometimes it's hard not to use his observations when I share them; indeed David Ferguson (ferguson-6) is my 'goto' review source as he is a reviewer extraordinaire. In Joker's case he mentions, as did another friend and movie aficionado did, that the co-writer and director Todd Phillips surprised us with this movie, in that his previous work would not lead us to expect what he delivered here. Way to go Todd!I won't repeat or mention the storyline, you probably have read it and should (use ferguson-6 review storyline); it could easily fit as prequel to \"The Dark Knight\", the movie which garnered the 2009 best supporting actor win for Heath Ledger in his role as the Joker. As fine, okay 'great', as Ledger's performance was, Phoenix' is not a bit less than great too. Joaquin Phoenix has earned two Oscar nominations already in the past, for best actor and one for best supporting actor and it's time he gets the win because he deserves it. The Joker conveys well where his darkness comes from, and Phoenix is very believable in a character that barely is when you relate it to your own life; it's what I mean by him deserving an Oscar for that performance.I usually pay attention to the OST (original soundtrack) and when I listened to the last track as I watched the closing scene, I couldn't help my self and went \"\"Wow!\"",

But it the movie it looked like he was born yesterday & all the mean things happening for the first time right when the plot started.\nThe crazy behavior looked unnecessary, forced & unrealistic as mentally challenged folks keep social distancing, don't believe that loud in public. Just because you want to put a crazy guy on screen doesn't make it justified.\nSecondly, his anger towards society was unclear. He had his mother, a job best to his potential along with a home given the entire city was all hell loose. What's he complaining about, anyways.\nThird, Gotham city is no Buddha city and by judging the madness around why wouldn't you search a guy before letting on national TV more so as the sole reason for him bieng invited to the show was him being wack job.There are certain points worth mentioning.\n1. Long.\n2. Dull storyline.\n3. Pointless plot.\n4. Misinterpretation of human psychology.\n5. Unpleasant to watch.\n6. Unjustified character development.\n7. Being silly, when someone fires a gun on LIVE TV you don't send one cop car.\n8. Lastly, how in Gods name did the two investigating officers landed up asking for him regarding the subway shootout while half the city is on rampage?\n9. Did anyone else observe Joaquin's body was all bones yet his cheek fat intact. Strange anatomy.Go watch it or don't. Your choice. Judge yourself according to your taste & pocket.

And they say how good it is because, \"in comic book movies they all do this or that.\" If you're familiar with anything from the 70s (when they made real movies) and I'm assuming most the teens that gush over this haven't. You would know that this movie is ripping off those. Particularly Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of comedy.I guess that's where we are with movies these days. You have to actually take another movie and almost remake it. It's not like when Nolan said The Dark Knight was inspired by Heat. You didn't think of Heat during the movie but after you hear that you can see it.With this movie it stinks of the little brother trying to be his big brother. Everything about this movie feels like Todd Phillips trying to look like one of the big boys. When he should really stay when he belongs, if even that. The camera style and everything was emulating instead of innovating.And the worst part of this garbage masquerading as art: De Niro. I have never seen him miscast before. Of course he's one of the best ever and will never phone it in. But when you think of charismatic, Johnny Carson like talk show host do you think De Niro? I thought since he's such a good actor that he would surprise me. But he didn't. Maybe if he was playing like a Dick Sullivan type he would be better suited. Or god forbid an original character that wasn't based off of something else. And I'm sure the teens that saw this and will grow up thinking that this is what good movies are all about have no idea who Johnny Carson is. It legitimized the movie a bit to hear that Bobby was in it but then I remembered his recent output. And instead of an Irishman we got another Grudge Match. A movie where he was hired for nostalgia.Phoenix does a great job but he's over the top. His laughing thing is so annoying. And so much time is spent on it. Don't even get me started on their psychological inaccuracies. This movie helps to prove why you shouldn't have a Joker origin. And why they didn't have one in the comics until he had been around for 40 years. And that one sucked as well. Making bad guy focused movies is not a good idea. You don't want to sympathize with them. They're the bad guys. 89 Batman had a great origin because Joker was already bad and then became crazy. And The Dark Knight was great because not knowing only added to the character. You know his story story and it takes away from him being the villain.And this was supposed to be a stand alone but then we see (yet again) Bruce Wayne's parents get killed? I guess they just couldn't help themselves to world build? And people claim this isn't a comic book movie. They're making a sequel right?",

    "reviewTitle": "Director Phillips' moral equivalence between criminality fueled by mental illness and a one-dimensional corrupt, fascistic society, proves specious",
    "reviewBody": "Director Todd Phillips' origin story stars Joaquin Phoenix in a dark, gritty fairy tale as to how the Joker of DC Comics fame, became the number one criminal of Gotham City. Phillips likens Gotham to a New York City of the very early 80s, replete with rampant crime, a garbage strike, rats, Joe Franklin-like TV shows, graffiti laden subway cars and VCRs.\nThe Joker's decompensation is shown in increments as he devolves into criminality and madness. The main strike against him is that he never moved out of his mother's apartment and takes care of his demented elderly mother, who has a long history of mental health issues. Eventually, in a scene where he's able to illegally extract an old report from the state mental hospital, he learns that his mother used to work for (now) mayoral candidate, Gotham's power broker Thomas Wayne (father of Bruce, who eventually became Batman). It appears that the mother developed the delusion that Wayne impregnated her and that the Joker is actually Wayne's illegitimate son.\nThe Joker ends up paying a visit to the Wayne mansion where he encounters little Bruce and chokes Alfred the Butler, after not being allowed in to see Thomas Wayne. Soon afterward, he's able to sneak into a concert hall where he punches the elder Wayne who's just finished relieving himself in the bathroom.\nPhillips also fills in the backstory of the Joker's daily life in which he constantly finds himself laughing inappropriately in public (it's later brought out he sustained a brain injury after his mother's boyfriend smashed his head in against a radiator when he was a child). The Joker even has a card made up which he gives to strangers whenever he's subject to these laughing outbursts, explaining the origin of this peculiar neurological condition.\nThere's quite a bit more dark stuff we end up privy to--including how the Joker loses his Rent-a-Clown job after he drops a gun at a hospital where he's entertaining children (a co-worker had given him the gun after a bunch of punks assault him while he's working as a street performer) as well as how he murders three Wall Street types on a subway train after they taunt and beat him up.\nThe Joker also develops a thing for Sophie, the next door neighbor who has a young daughter. Phillips does well in showing how The Joker deludes himself into believing that he has developed some kind of romantic relationship with her. He even imagines Sophie visiting him and mother at the hospital, after she has a stroke.\nFor all the imagined scenarios, reality intrudes. There's a scene where Sophie confronts him and asks whether the Joker has been following her. And later he breaks into her apartment and when she comes home, the Joker asks her, \"You're Sophie, right?\" as if in reality, he hardly knew her. When he leaves the apartment, we're left wondering if he ended up murdering his neighbor but Phillips wisely keeps it a mystery.\nAll in all, Phillips is intent on portraying a man who is gradually losing his grip on reality and becoming more and more violent. The Joker even ends up suffocating his mother with a pillow, causing her death. But Phillips unfortunately wants it both ways: as much as how he adroitly depicts how the Joker became the master criminal he came to be, he also attempts to evoke sympathy for him by depicting society (both the community and government) besieged by a simplistic, fascistic mentality and morality.\nPhillips draws a moral equivalence between the Joker's criminality (perhaps excused by so-called mental illness) and a society motivated by promoting the haves over the have-nots. The Joker is a perennial victim beginning with Thomas Wayne who not only has no toleration for lawlessness and will use any means necessary in cracking down on the disenfranchised but has no sympathy for the Joker (who's convinced that Thomas is his father).\nThere are no moderates in Phillips' comic book world. The Joker's therapy sessions must be discontinued due to government cuts (they obviously no longer have resources or patience for the disenfranchised). The Joker's co-worker (whom he eventually stabs to death) believes only in vigilante justice and gives him the gun with the proviso that he pay him back out of his salary.\nThe three upstanding Wall Street guys who end up beating the Joker up on the train, do so without mercy, and he responds by executing them. The Joker's life-long dream of becoming a standup comedian is fulfilled after he's invited on to the Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro) Show but this is only after the show's producers utilize earlier clips of the Joker performing at a comedy club, in order to mock him.\nThe Joker becomes a movement when he executes Murray Franklin on live TV and then is hailed as a hero by criminals who now regard him as some sort of savior. As much as Phillips may abhor the violence of those who advocate class warfare on the basis of income inequality, he also revels in the violence by harping on it and depicting the Joker as some kind of victim.\nThe denouement is also unsatisfying as Phillips suggests that after The Joker is locked up at the state mental hospital, this whole story might have been a figment of his imagination. That way I suppose Phillips can escape accusations of promoting a moral equivalency between criminality fueled by mental illness and an indifferent, one dimensional fascistic society.",

    "reviewBody": "The acting in this movie was superb and the music was excellent. That being said, I was disappointed that they painted the joker as someone with a schizophrenic disorder. The stigma of mental illness is already a problem that plagues society, it's disappointing for Hollywood to continue to endorse the negative stigma. In reality, the majority of crimes are not committed by people who are mentally ill. Also, there is no way they would have stopped a persons medicine cold turkey just because they ran out of funds. They always refer them to someone who can fill their medication, especially when someone is severely mentally ill. In reality, the social worker who didn't refer him to someone would have been held legally liable for the murders.",

Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to get the movie, but I found it unpleasant ( except for the Sinatra music and the setting). I do not care for Arthur/Joker and did not have one speck of sympathy for him Why? For one his goal is not to make things better, it is about anarchy ( unlike say what we saw in V is for Vendetta). Spoilers ahead: Who people should feel for is young Bruce Wayne who sees his parents murdered in cold blood in front of him. There is nothing funny about seeing a child orphaned. As far as movies are concerned, I enjoyed Ledger and Nicholson as Joker, and I also liked him in comics and cartoons. Why? He is the perfect counterpoint to Batman, and vice versa.. Batman almost never laughs and Joker ( rarely) cries. This is a movie of hopelessness and depression, that makes you feel things cannot possibly get better. While Batman is the Dark Knight and that name alone says he not a fun loving character with wisecracks like Spider-Man, his presence in Gotham City gives hope of a better future ( something not seen in Joker). A very unpleasant experience that got me angry. I did not like the movie. 0/10 stars.",

    "reviewTitle": "The laugh suffered",
    "reviewBody": "\"Joker\" has been causing controversy and boycotts because of its glorification of violence, but the truth is that there is no glorification, not even a pretentious movie or danger as many say, is a movie of acts and consequences, with a character building excellent and exceptional direction, not to mention Joaquim's magical acting, \"Joker\" overcomes any distrust of his artistic factor, is a feature that uses the magic of cinema to tell a powerful and poetic story. Joker's screenplay was conceived by todd Phillips, a filmmaker who has an all-comedy career, and this makes Toddy get a better sense of his character building, of course, the director has a lot of inspiration from movies like \"Taxi Driver\". \",\" The king of comedy \",\" The worker \"and even\" Indomitable bull \"large majority directed by Scorsese-Who came to participate in the production of the film- and starring de de Niro, which is in the film, ie the young director is coming advised. Despite having a whole cinematic study of what he wanted to do, \"Joker\" doesn't have a perfect script, but comes close to that, his character building is deep and slow, and starts from breaks, we are introduced to a troubled character. and anguish and we have a first act focused on increasing those anguish and problems, then we have the absorption of a kind of social disorder so, in a short third act, the joker is born, it is an impeccable construction that plays between fantasy and reality. , this thin line causes a haze in the viewer's vision that begins to get confused about the social chaos and mood of the protagonist, from this point of view we understand a little Joker, a character broken by the society that accumulates sorrows, his momentum not angry, he's a refuge, he sees his sociopath as something funny, a morbid, subtle and deep transfer of feelings that helps build an atmosfer that of madness and insanity in a grand way, one of the best character builds I've ever seen. We have a critique of governmental abandonment and inefficiency supporting the sick and containing social chaos, the failure of public agencies creates a city prone to violence and chaos making Joker's anguish more easily breed, parental abandonment, lack of figure The paternal feeling that is strongly felt by the character helps him to become unsupported and loose in this sick immersion that all bases, whether family or social, are inefficient in containing his sickening momentum, is a critique of us and the system we have created. Todd Phillips gives a directing show, we knew the filmmaker had some technical talent, for good or bad, the \"If you don't marry drink\" trilogy is very well directed, but here he goes further and completely changes his driving style, his camera is subjective and there is a total mix of styles, sometimes we have a wonderful curious handheld camera that is peeking at the protagonist's metamorphosis, sometimes the cemera is fixed and seeks more ambiguous and open angles, the camera looks sideways, approaches, It moves away, it is a camera that causes a total immersion to the viewer, several are the strange filming we usually see in the cinema, capturing different points and angles of our protagonist, it is as if the camera was afraid of Joker, always contained and little focal, the photograph is impeccable, much like \"Taxi Driver\" we have a greenish, melancholy and dirty photograph, it is a depressing photograph that composes and of life the social anguish of Joker, the Other points are great too, such as the costume and makeup, and of course, we have a magnificent, theatrical, high and high soundtrack that permeates the whole feature, a track that looks like a horror movie, but works great here. Todd Phillips puts Joaquim Phoenix with his hand at the Oscars, at least with a guaranteed nomination, Joaquim does more than just staging, he understands his character, lives him and expresses his anguish and frustrations with frightening liveliness, it's a character delivery impressive, the actor lives his character more than just facially and psychologically, his whole body is shaped Joker's agony, his decomposing physical state, his anomalies, his weight in walking, his difficulty in raising his head, we have a delivery and a bodily and physical act too, it's a complete plunge into the heart of the joker, the actor laughs in a scary way, more so than he laughs, and we feel he's crying, his characterization is great too, unless something extraordinary later this year, Joaquim Phoenix performs impeccably and one of the best performances of recent years. De Niro is also great, it is wonderful to see such an important and remarkable actor for the cinema coming back to perform so well. \"Joker\" was very hypado, this is always detrimental in a movie, but he can meet expectations by creating a reread of movie classics adapted and conjectured into a pop culture character, an immersion in violence, insanity and hurt, a challenge to social isolation and hatred that we cultivate in the society of this always, all aligned to a great acting and direction, the film is not perfect, telegraphs some scenes and at one point underestimates the intelligence of the viewer, but it gets lost in its ocean of merits, \"Joker\" is not a hero movie nor is it for any audience, it is a heavy drama about melancholy and insanity. (Spoilers) = It's hard to say a few things about the movie without giving up events, for example its final dubiousness, where it remains open whether the Joker killed his psychologist, going out of his way and actually turning you into a psychopath or not, and leaving the character alive for a possible future continuation, other details are magnificent too, the dirty construction of the city where at certain times we defied the fact and we question if the city is rotten or we are seeing through the eyes of Arthur, where everything is dirty, The \"little dance\" that Joaquim plays after the first murders is also spectacular, it is a moment where Arthur finds his peace and slowly begins his transfiguration. Another interesting point, which already talks with the film's dark humor, is a joke, perhaps the most profound of the film, which is not spoken by the joker but by the director when he scales De Niro for his film, director Todd Philips is very much mirrored. in several films, some of them are \"Taxi Driver\", \"The Comedy King\" and \"Raging Bull\" all starring De Niro, where he plays a broken character who finds an escape in violence, Todd brings the niro to his feature and kills him through a character who suffers from the same ills, aside from being a sadistic joke, we can interpret it as an allegory, where violence finally returned to De Niro, another interesting point, is that all these films are directed by Scorsese, who was part of the production of the film.",

    "reviewBody": "Overall, the acting is the best part of the movie. Most of all Joaquin, but also Di Niro and the wonderful Frances Conroy (big fan).\nHowever, several skills of the Joker were left out, f. e. top strategist or excellent chemist. What was left is a so-and-so comedian bordering on looser turning into a psychopath. And please, the cliche of bad childhood and the mother did him wrong, etc.... Worth a big Joker laugh.\nI also missed the grand finale, maybe Arthur is using the raids to increase them, creating chaos, etc.\nIn the end it is a good movie about the Character development from looser to psycho. Not new, but well done and acted. For me it is just not the title character.I will be happy if Joaquin might get an Oscar or Frances as supporting actress, but can't see the movie deserving more awards.About the often in the media mentioned brutality... Well brutal behavior in a movie about a psychopath.... Wow... I am shocked... Who would have thought... *end sarcasm* 😂",

    "reviewBody": "A film with a laudable performance by Phoenix. The film highlights several unpleasant aspects:\n1. The PBA disturbance which I doubt the masses(which includes me) are aware of and the traumatic life such a person may lead\n2. The effects of the lack of medication for such a disturbance or the effectiveness of such medicines, in first place\n3. The never-ending saga of bullying\n4. The general insensitivity of the media and talk show hosts.The background score of the movie is good but is an overkill.The screenplay of the movie, the themes and the in general the origin story/retrofit is not only unconvincing and flawed but also seems to deliver a wrong message.\n1. The obsession of linking Joker/Fleck to the Wayne family - Fleck's mother's history, Wayne Enterprise employees beating up Fleck and finally the ideological assassination of the Wayne family by a protester\n2. Fleck being adopted and having suffered childhood abuse is such a lame and clichéd plot aspect used by the writers\n3. Plausible:\nLack of medication, disturbing discoveries and sort of revenge causes Fleck to go on a killing spree and even enjoying the attention that he receives unexpectedly\nImplausible:\nSocial commentary by Fleck on the show, his sudden liking to riots and chaos. I couldn't believe that they send a detective/psychiatrist to meet Fleck in jail but she's unaware of his disorder and thinks that a PBA-suffering Fleck is laughing at some joke!! Seriously? Are the police and other agencies do dumb to not investigate history of such a criminal?\n4. While it's unfair to go into too much of details, I don't understand how a person who likes to dance and become a stand-up comedian would end up having a predilection and some talent in chemical weapons, dynamite, explosives etc. Which are Joker's speciality? Is the viewer supposed to assume that the Fleck cultivates these skills from scratch after he turns into 'Joker'?\n5. Last but the most important point - Joker, as we know since ages, is a class-I psychopath who feels no remorse or emotions and enjoys killings and chaos. While such psychopaths get a bit influenced by their surroundings, they are genetically/pathologically having some issues that makes them what they are. In this movie, they somehow try to come up with a cocktail of reasons that give rise to Joker. The worse part is the that riots, vandalism and criminal activities are portrayed as a natural outcome of expressing your discontent.Overall, the movie is a poor origin story of an iconic psychopath like Joker. Watch it as an independent psychological thriller but not as a 'Rise of Joker' film.",

If you are raving that Joker is a great film, then it is clear you have the intellect of a piece of lint. If you were one that propagated that Joker was ultra-violent, then it's clear you watched a different film because there is only one violent scene in the entire film that lasted a few seconds.The movie \"Joker\" is a pathetic waste of time. 55% of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix laughing or dancing awkwardly. The other 45% is spent attempting to create the Joker origin, but is really just political trash.The Joker is the hero - the poor and mentally ill, yet violently murdering sociopath is the hero of this film. Batman is evil as were his parents. The Wayne's deserved to die because according to this film they were rich, so they should be demonized and killed. That's a clear point because in this movie all rich people should die.There is no actual plot. No actual point. No deep meaning. \"Joker\" attempts an origin, while making a political stage to demonize \"rich\" people. Joker is clearly a political film written and produced to promote sociopathic violence against anyone that works or earns their living. Rich people beware. Question is though is this message directed also at the rich folks that wrote, produced, directed, or acted in this movie? Nope.I also found the film dishonest intellectually in the understanding of mental disorders. It's offensive towards the mentally ill. A few questions: How is a woman that's been diagnosed as delusional and a sociopath qualify to adopt a child? Why would a mentally ill person, that is on a city assisted program, not have any other options if that social facility shut down? Why is severe mental illness and sociopathy applauded in this film as heroic traits?The only part of this movie I enjoyed was when the nut-job & violent propagating talk show host got shot.

    "reviewBody": "It seems like they were making a movie about psychotic killer clown and halfway during production decided to slap on a \"Joker\" title to make an \"origin\" movie about one of the most iconic villains of all time. They could literary change a couple of names and put the \"Depressed psycho killer clown\" as a title and it wouldn't make any difference. Well, at least i would give it a 5 out of 10 score. Maybe.Phoenix's Joker is stripped, sliced, diced, blended and strained to reduce him to only one of many aspects of character itself, insanity. Well that, and clown clothes. No other character traits Joker is famous, feared and loved for are there, and I just can't see them developing ever in this version of him. Even the movie itself is a slap to the one of the most important part of the lore and characterisation, Joker never truly revealed his true identity and even the three comic book versions of his genesis are probably all lies (well Jack Napier is just a shortcut for the story sake in first Keaton's Batman, movie-wise). Forget the deadly toys and gadgets, where are the genius intellect, prankster personality, wits, planning 5 steps ahead? True Joker is the driving force, this one is just a passenger in a cab (Taxi Driver pun intended). Joker would never pitty on himself, he does not laugh because he has a psychological condition and can't help it, he laughs because he is genuinely amused with all the terror and pain he inflicts, he IS truly a psychopath, not a person with some type of Tourette syndrome pushed in a world of murder and crime. And most of all Joker is supposed to be actually funny in his sick and twisted way, not only to himself (as Phoenix is) but to all of us. This is the first time i did not find anything funny in ones depiction of the Joker (well Leto's performance is a pretty good contender, but i won't judge him on the basis of 37 seconds of screen time lol, and even that was closer to Joker than this).As if you make a Batman movie where the Dark Knight is only left with his early fear of bats and mask with pointy ears, or the Iron Man where Tony is only a rich pompous jerk.And when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman Joker will be, what, 65, 70 years old?This movie doesn't work as an origin story, it doesn't work as a standalone (it's composed of only one really long act with a glimpse of a second one), nor as a part of DC in general. It is not an origin story we need, nor deserve, it simply isn't a Joker story.",

    "reviewTitle": "The perfect film",
    "reviewBody": "I want to know how anyone can NOT give this film a score of 10!\nIt's impeccable in every way! Long term fan of Joaquin, but here his acting culminates in the most amazing, Oscar worthy performance ever!Not everyone who watches Joker may be a Batman fan, and some may not agree with the storyline featuring him and Thomas Wayne. But if you can ignore the routes the other films follow and just immerse yourself in this storyline it makes perfect sense.It's a huge wake up call for mental illness and how it can be dealt with by society. Persecuted and beaten up for uncontrollable laughter! The epitome of negative attitudes towards those less fortunate.And no ridiculous storylines about falling into a tank of acid to become the joker. However I am not knocking the performance of Jack or Heath as the same character. Imo they were both equally as perfect in their own rights.The mere fact that the start and the whole film is Joker trying to write jokes and become a comedian, and has to go through a huge metamorphosis to become the character we all know and love, then refuses to tell his councillor at the end because \"she won't get it\" is the perfect anticlimax that he deserves!Acting throughout is flawless, the pace is perfect. I love the slowness. Because even tho you may end up aching in the cinema rafter watching it, the longevity of the story carries on for ages after you leave.It's a movie that you can watch over and over and really empathise with Arthur. A mentally ill person who is tarnished by a failing prejudicial society who eventually constructs a demonic, revenge fuelled monster. A perfect film. A perfect metaphor.",

    "reviewTitle": "No joke here. The phoenix has truly risen. Joaquin really deserve his Oscar.",
    "reviewBody": "Todd Phillips has a very unique approach to writing and directing a comic book flick. Instead of having a lot of typical fantasy like tropes. This motion picture went for the more ground crime drama character study story with DC Comics Batman's arch nemesis 'The Joker'. Something that a lot of fans kinda wanted. After all, while a number of backstories have been given in the comics, a definitive one has not yet been established for the clown prince of crime. However, fans of the psychopath criminal mastermind version of him will probably not like this movie. This form has him as a somewhat mentally disable impoverished depress comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) whose descent closer into insanity and nihilism when disregarded by society in a decaying Gotham City during 1981. Let's face it. The character is far cry departure from the versions we got in previous movies. He's less a villain and more like an antihero in this film. Arthur just wants people to be happy. Losing 52 pounds, Joaquin does portray the naïve starving artist well. The scenes where his rib cage is visual are quite upsetting. The way Phoenix walks up the stairs with his shoulder slumped down show how downtrodden Arthur really is. Great use of body language. The facial expressions including the makeup run offs that Joaquin does are also well perform. Whenever Arthur's condition caused him to uncontrollably laugh. His mouth opens way too wide that it looks distressing. On several occasions they are indistinguishable from his sobbing. It really illustrated Arthur's declining mental state. However, the film is so heavily influence by Martin Scorsese's 1976 movie 'Taxi Driver' & 1982 'King of Comedy' that many of this film scenes felt like clichés reenactments like the fake out shot me sign moment involving love interest Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz). Another bothersome I got was due to the character's chronic daydreaming, it makes the audience question just how much of the film, we see is happening in real time and how much of it is Arthur's fantasizing. Because of that the movie has a lot of deliberately somewhat annoying open-ended plot holes. For example, how he was able to get away with so many murders. Killing a patient at the hospital without setting off the alarm on the heart monitor machine and even being allowed in the building after an infamous previous gun accident seem unlikely. That or the cops really slow to arrested people. After all Arthur has plenty of time to sleep, get dress, eat and murder a coworker after breaking in a neighbor's room. The logic in these scenes are a bit annoying as the entire ending plays like a deranged hallucination rather than a genuine series of events. The whole idea of the Wayne family seeing a movie during the riots seem a bit forced. In truth I don't think the film never really figured out a true decent climax. That's why I believe when Arthur told the psychiatrist that she wouldn't get the joke. I think the whole story might have been made up, in order to troll the whole audience to feel sympathy for him and his crimes. Whether Arthur becomes the actual Joker as seen in traditional Batman lore or inspires a separate character is ambiguous. Either way, Arthur will be an old man by the time Batman is established. Regardless the film is a little too heavy handed and preachy when it comes to dealing with people with mental health. After all, none of the supporting characters Arthur hurts really deserve their punishment besides the three oddly seem out of place rich guys on the train. None of them are fully evil to be sympathetic. Some of them honestly are friendly and help Arthur more than they harm such as giving him protection and a chance to redeem himself on television when they could had run away. As of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) he gave Arthur the truth about his origin even after what the unstable man did to him. Although how much of a jerk he is left up to the viewer's interpretation of what Arthur's origins truly was. With that it's really hard to believe that Fleck would repress the abusive memories of his past for that long. Still I do dig the theories involving that. I just wish the film had more comic book references rather than the small mentions. As for shouts out to other media. The best use has to be Charlie Chaplin's 1936's film 'Modern Times'. Not only is the movie's footage visual in the movie, but the cover of \"Smile\" is haunting along with Stephen Sondheim's 'Send in the Clowns' song. I like that the music is generally discordant, unsettling and tonally dissonant. It reflects Arthur's feverish mental state so well. The sequence involving dancing on the stairs is so iconic. I really like how the sets & locations looks. It's an urban nightmare. No wonder why Arthur went crazy. As for the controversy surrounding the film revolves around being sympathetic towards killers & this movie might inspiring copycats. I understand why. It wasn't even shown in certain parts of Colorado due to the 2012 Aurora shooting. Many police forces and even the US Army were also put on alert when this flick was released in theaters. In the end, the film still got the last laugh as it made a ton of money. However, Warner Bros did make a movie that push buttons with its themes in class warfare and gun control that I doubt a sequel would be made. They don't even considered part of the DC Extended Universe. Instead, it is an Else worlds story. In the end, while entertaining & thought provoking at certain parts. It's still a disturbing film. The film presents no solutions, promotes despair and really is a glorification of violence. Just know that when seeing this movie. It's one film that certainly not to have a happy ending.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Decent Joker Take, But Not The One I Prefer",
    "reviewBody": "After seeing the credits roll on \"Joker\", it took me a bit to figure out my exact feelings towards it. On one hand, there is nothing inherently bad about the film, and it certainly is a new/fresh way to examine that character's backstory mythos. On the other hand, however, there is also a thought that nagged me which said that something was a bit \"off\" about the whole thing. The conclusion I've come to is that while \"Joker\" is a legitimate take on his origins, it just isn't the #1 (or even #2) take that I prefer.For a basic overview, this film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who works as an entertaining clown to support himself. Arthur clearly also has some some of mental illness, including the propensity for laughter when the emotional situation does not call for it. The combination of all these factors sees Fleck mistreated or put down by society at nearly every step of his Gotham-dwelling existence. After perpetuating a subway murder and then being embarrassed on live television by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the late-night talk show host he idolizes, Fleck transforms himself into the tragically comedic figure Batman fans know well.I actually have more respect than most, I think, towards the validity of this \"take\" on The Joker. It is easily the most gritty and true-to-life that has ever been attempted at this point. Basically, WB and director Todd Phillips are saying \"here is how a real-life Joker figure could spring up\", right down to explaining the makeup and predilection towards uncontrollable laughter. In and of itself, there really isn't anything \"wrong\" with this take.That being said, I still prefer Ledger's mysterious Joker of \"The Dark Knight\" or even Nicholson's mob-leader Joker of \"Batman (1989)\". Acting performances strictly aside for the moment, I just don't know about--and feel a little uncomfortable with--the Joker being a tragic figure. I prefer the comic-book approach of Nicholson falling into the vat of chemicals, or the air of mystery surrounding where exactly Ledger's Joker came from. Having this Phoenix Joker spring from a place of potential sympathy? However legitimate that take may be, I just don't like it as much.There are also a few frustrating choices that hold back the overall story of the film:\n-A subplot involving Arthur's neighbor down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz) goes absolutely nowhere and ends up meaning very little.\n-The shoehorning of the Wayne family into the movie. Did we really need to see the Waynes murder again?! That's becoming a parody of itself at this point. Plus, scenes that feature Fleck and any member of the Wayne family feel like pandering to the Batman crowd rather. The cherry on top, of course, is the insinuation (true or false) that Fleck may actually be a Wayne family relation. Again, that's taking the \"easy way out\" when it comes to crafting this story.Fortunately, \"Joker\" does enough things right to make it watchable. It isn't boring by any means, the music and overall production value is great, and Phoenix does give a great performance. For the tone of the character that Phillips is trying to create, Phoenix is marvelous, actually.Overall, though, I only moderately enjoyed this take on the Joker mythos. Maybe, had this been the first attempt at doing so, I'd feel differently. But as it stands, it comes down to me liking other interpretations of the character more than this one.",

Phoenix is quite chilling to watch, as you watch him lose his mind. The movie borrows heavily from such films like Taxi Driver(1976) and The King of Comedy(1983). Robert De Niro is pretty memorable has Murray Hamilton, a Johnny Carson like talk show host. Phoenix really delivers a great performance, you can tell he became the character when the camera was rolling. One problem I had they showed the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, which I felt was not needed, better to be hinted at it instead, and the end keeps dragging itself out, to the point you'll be telling yourself end already.

    "reviewTitle": "A Very Competent Film",
    "reviewBody": "Like this movie or not, you have to agree its at least a breath of fresh air. Phoenix does a great job at channeling just the right amount of psycho to portray the Joker.The cinematography and lighting is very well done and really sets the atmosphere. While I agree with some that the morales of the movie can be misconstrued, it seems to be about coming out of your shell to be your true self and not caring what others think.I did feel at times the movie was a bit preachy though. The whole \"we live in a society...\" comes off rather strong towards the end. Society and rich people = bad!! That was a bit too on the nose.I also never really got the notion that this Joker was clever or intelligent in this movie. He just seemed psychotic. Which is really only a small part of what makes the character scary.Now, I get that its from the Jokers point of view, but the Waynes and almost ALL other characters are just shown to be total one dimensional a-holes that we dont really have sympathy for. This could have been handled better I believe.BUT, what makes these bad things listed above so interesting, is the very real possibility that the events in the film were actually all in the Jokers mind. Its established early on that he has delusions often, so the entire revolution and his rise to hero status could have very well been all imagined, which makes a lot of sense.In conclusion though, I appreciated the risks the movie took and performance given by Phoenix. It was a fresh take on an already well established character, which can be difficult to do. And considering all of the god awful movies released now a days, I cant blame people who praise it as a perfect 10. Its deff worth it to give it a watch for yourself.",

    "reviewTitle": "The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.",
    "reviewBody": "I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.\nIn my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.\nAnd I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories",
    "reviewBody": "Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.",

    "reviewTitle": "downbeat, overblown & so so long. Cuts all your favourite characters down to size",
    "reviewBody": "Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future",

    "reviewTitle": "Good but a mess in the story department...",
    "reviewBody": "A nice production for those only interested in action sequences but not so great for those wanting closure of the Marvel story line...The best part of the film is that it brings together all previous Marvel movies to drive the plot... And the worst part of the film is it brings together all previous marvel movies to drive the plot... because it seems the production team don't really know the stories that ran before...\nAnyone who follows the stories (from the movies, not the comic) will know there are much easier time points to collect each of the stones... The drama created by making this 'collection plan' much more difficult than it needed to be, added at least an unnecessary hour to the movie...Other plot points that didn't sit well with me and reduced the enjoyment of the movie, are...1) Thanos 'killed' 50% of the \"good guys\" and he's hailed as a super villain... Tony 'killed' 100% of the bad guys and he's a hero? Don't heroes learn from their own pain and sufferings and on principal refuse to inflict the same misery on others?Surely, other than Thanos and a few of his more loyal subjects, the rest are simply following orders...\n(On another tangent, Thanos seems to really believe in his cause because after he killed off half the universe, including his people I believe, he lived alone and not with an army of servants and subjects for him to rule as a king... That's honourable...)2) they didn't reverse time... Just brought everyone back with a 5 year time gap... People should not behave normally when loved ones they haven't been with for 5 years suddenly reappear... Those who have survived those 5 years didn't get their memories and aging removed, right?3) how did Thanos and his gang all time travel while the avengers are so calculative about one person 2 trips?A 30 second segment showing Thanos instructing his people to mass produce the Pym solution for time travel would have closed this plot hole.4) always disliked Captain Marvel because she is so powerful that no other super heros need to exist...\nAnd still... She is so concerned about other worlds that she couldn't be bothered to be present for the start of the biggest battle her home planet is about to face... when every known superhero showed up at the right time and right place...And later, the battle actually showed she's not all that great... So her weakness is she sweats the small stuff, can't see the big picture and not available/functional when needed?4) If they can bring back Gamora, why can't they find a timeline to bring back Natasha and even Tony? Superheros really don't like to plan and think things through... (Same as when they don't seek the easiest points to retrieve the stones... With zero time pressure for planning...)5) speaking of Gamora, the Gamora who came with Thanos don't know the guardian crew at all... so even though she's not 'evil' like the old Nabula, she wouldn't be friendly like she knows they are the 'good guys'...\nBased on the time line, she doesn't even know Quill yet... So she should view him and them as the enemy in the battle...6) Nabula... If she killed her historic self, shouldn't she just drop dead in the new timeline?\nGrandfather paradox anyone?7) what's with that special scene where all the women heroes joined together to show their power?\nTo me, that's totally sexist...Speaking for myself, I enjoy male and female superheros for their individual powers and weaknesses... Once a person reaches superhero status, in my mind, they crease to represent a gender (other than those gender/age stereotypes to generate laughs and endearment...)Having al female scene shows me that the production team are so hung up on being politically correct that they generate a reverse sexist scene to feel they are all inclusive... Sigh...\nThese same people want a female James Bond / Indiana Jones but not a male Mary Poppins / Eliza Doolittle... And they think the rest of the world is sexist...\nThe self proclaimed tolerant and inclusive are starting to paint themselves into a corner...8) while it's nice to see Bruce and the Hulk getting along...an unangry Hulk takes away what makes the Hulk a character...Remember these famous words? \"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry\"... that's gone now... Sigh...9) speaking of which... Why on earth would the Hulk go into battle in an amour suit? Surely that was made for Bruce when the Hulk refused to come out to play?How would the Hulk fit inside and why would he need it? That's taking power away from the Hulk and it pissed me off...10) if the Ancient One knows and sees all possibilities... Even knowing when Dr Strange will show up... How did she not see the Hulk coming to ask for the stone?11) Loki's escape with the tesseract surely would have spun an alternate time line... Since there is only ONE tesseract... Then much of the previous stories wouldn't really make sense if Loki had it almost immediately after he lost it ...12) Captain America basically anointed the Falcon to be the next Capt? *Roll eyes*...I think the Falcon already has a lot going and Bucky should be a better successor...\nIn any case, we won't see Thor succeed the iron Man suit because he doesn't really need the extra edge...\nBucky is a super soldier in the same vein as the Capt. And should have been his first choice for a successor...13) did Captain America just ignore world events for the last century while he hid with Peggy? (& what did he do after she died... Surely she can't live as long as he... Wouldn't he simply come back to the 'present' having enjoyed a full and loving life, and not yet as old as he became?) ... The Production team might wish to rewatch Highlander...😋He never got the itch to help the 'current' Captain America fight injustice? He resisted the urge to pass on information that might help the avengers as he had lived through all the events before? (I know, I know... Can't/shouldn't change history... But how could he resist, for someone like him who loves to lecture and lead?)14) the biggest plot hole of all and the one that buried the movie for me... is...The Thanos that was in the battle came from before the previous movie right? (Infinity war)...If Tony Stark kills Thanos in this movie... That means none of the previous movie plot could have happened... Nobody was \"killed off\" (not even Loki...)... Nobody lost/gained 5 years of their lives... Thor didn't need to get fat, none of this movie should even get started...That's the devil when idiot film makers dabble with time travel in a non-time-travel movie... Adding this means they can't take care of the details properly...The above are just the main plot annoyances... And there and many other smaller ones which prevented a truly epic movie experience...3 hours is a long movie and much of it unnecessary if they tightened the plot to make more sense...So, while the movie is good...I wouldn't selectively watch it again... Which to me is the benchmark of a great movie.I'm torn in giving a rating... I want to give 7 based on the scale of the production and emotional ties it has on me from all the previous Marvel movies...But the constant I'm jolted with throughout the film killed much of my buzz and for that I want to give it a 2... Sto be fair... it'll get a 4 overall to balance both sides...",

The entire movie is \"hype\" revolving around a ridiculous time \"heist\". They even made jokes about how stupid the idea is, and in 30 seconds Iron Man figures it out.This entire movies is cliches, re-used tropes, and one-liners used by familiar actors and amazing CGI.

    "reviewBody": "Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no...",

    "reviewBody": "This is the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel and the reboot of Fantastic Four. All of those movies are masterpieces compared to this heaping pile of trash.The only good thing that has come out of this movie is the memes. The pacing is agonizingly slow, the story honestly doesn't make much sense at all. The fact that the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige himself have to spoon feed you how brilliant and amazing this movie is goes to show how.bad it truly is.The characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney. They are just there for a paycheck at this point, and boy did they get a huge one for some lackluster, boring and honestly some of the worst performances I've seen on screen in my 24 years.Get ready to see Robert Downey jr. Acts like he is in a high school play with his children, the only genuine father figure that actually seems real is Jeremy Renner in this film, otherwise it is ridiculously boring, full of potholes, and it's just a giant flashback and re-use of old footage that honestly gave them material that they should have used differently.I'd like to say that we as Marvel fan's have been strapped in a chair. We can't move, the room is dark, and then Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers turn on the blinding lights and all walk in with spoons in their hands. They then proceed to, one by one, spoom feed us things like \"This movie is a masterpiece.\" \"The reason why that didn't make sense is because we forgot to put it in.\" \" We're so talented. Please waste your money on our talentless, bland films that we only make to make toys, merch and statues that people pay thousands of dollars for.\" \" We haven't completely checked out and are desperate for new talent.\" As you slowly lose conscience and black out.If you're looking to be in pain, by all means go and see this movie in the theater, but if you'd like to skip the boring Parts like I did, rent it on DVD. It's not worth buying nor is it worth watching more than once as some people have. To those people, I pray that your brain's get better >¤<",

    "reviewBody": "I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired",

Virtually the entire first 90 minutes could have been trimmed to about 15 mins.Pacing was terrible, it lost all momentum at times and was tedious.\nThe feel of the film, was all over the place, jumping from very dumb childish comedy to attempted serious drama and then to social commentary. It didn't natural have a core or flow to the film.So many stupid, misplaced scenes, such as the \"girl power\" nonsense, so contrived.Massive plot holes. I know Time Travel is a very difficult subject to tackle, but this made little sense. Either you cannot change the past or you can? This sometimes does and other times doesn't. If you steal the Stones then try to put them back. In theory they haven't been stolen, as you can't change the past, therefore, how can you put them back? How on earth did Captain America manage to put the Stones back and Thor's hammer and presumably the Green girl? They erased Thanos and the Robot girl in same timeline as well and that didn't effect anything?Apparently you can't kill a baby Thanos, but you can kill a slightly younger adult version of Thanos when he comes to the future that is okay.How did Capt A, put the Stones back at the exact time they left, without interfering with the original operation to retrieve them or changing the past anyway.The cringe worthy comedy was awful. There was a serious tone to Avengers, but this just turned into a cheap gag reel. Thors (a god) getting fat. Hulk getting fans.Corny cheap false scenes with Tony and his daughter, with the terrible music playing at the same time, like some cheap matinee from the 50's.Overall there was no feeling or emotion, the funeral scene was false and contrived.Pepper Potts is now Iron Woman?Spider-man goes back to school, after 5 years away? Really?I saw it with my teenage Daughter, she thought it was crap and we heard most people around us saying the same thing.A real stinker this one. 0/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Too long, Overrated, Mediocre, Badly Paced, Etc",
    "reviewBody": "Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being \"king\" or \"leader\" of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as. More honesty & less BS.2/10",

Second thing if Wanda just did what she did in the mini series everyone would be fine! I am not gonna say what she did for the spoilers, but nooo they wanted someone to die and of course it wasn't Spiderman which I realy hate ( He is annoying) it was Iron man , my favourite heroe , thank you Marvel for destroying my childhood . Everyone is like \" He is a hero , he saved everyone \" Nooo its not like that , Wanda could be the hero without dying!!! Or Captain Marvel to absolve all the jem power out of the glove BUT NOO someone had to die right? But if we don't see that part the rest of the movie was AWSOME!!!!",

    "reviewBody": "I am not a huge fan of the last Marvel movies. There are some very good movies, but the most is around average. Never so bad as most of the last DC movies. But Endgame is really game over for me.Please continue with X-men and guardians of the galaxy. It is enough for me. The rest I do not care anymore, it is ok like this. They professionally ruined it for me with Endgame.The story is very shallow, the solution is very shallow and also the action scenes are very shallow. Hours long they are busy with: yes we have something, but I have doubts, but it is great, but I don't know etc. And ofcourse all the heroes are very hurt and some are saying no at first, but already fast they overcome their hurt... And by the way: let's do some time traveling! Let's redo all the finding of the stones and snap the fingers a few times, it makes live so easy.So you have a 'big battle' where nothing happens and some action and after that it is saying goodbye to everybody. Oh wait! We forgot to think about a few death people, we just push commemorating them somewhere in the scenes. Iron man is the most important. Oh and captain Marvel is fixing everything ofcourse. I think she can save the whole universe on her own, who need the Avengers? And captain America has his ending: he is much older and guess what he did al that years? We do not need to guess because even that is explained, like we can not think for ourselves.Are there no good points? There was some humor and the graphics are looking good, but that is never the problem. And I see many people are happy with it, which I can not understand. But I do not need to. You can never make everybody happy, it is taste and interest. And for me this was a bad movie. Maybe the worst Marvel movie.",

Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that? Passing the title of CA to someone else when they don't even have superpowers?!!The more I think about it the worse it is.Just a money making ending with no thought or direction.Should have left it with infinity war.",

    "reviewBody": "Just overall badly written - down to the individual jokes not being funny, the side stories being uinteresting and the main plot also didn't work.Marvel apparently wants to reboot the MCU, by \"demoting\" or changing a lot of characters. None of the \"demotions\" were well done - instead of epic fights against Thanos resulting in the hero loosing his powers or getting injured, they more had them just slip our the back door. It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying. I don't know what went wrong in the writing process, bur something for sure did.",

Yeah he destroy the stone and retire. What a great villain...So our super hero go take care of Thanos easily and then nothing for a very long period of time. For a Marvel movie their is not much action and for an intelligent, deep or funny movie that's not a bad thing but for a movie like this it's just boring. I guess they think that since their is a lot of action at the end that we will forget the middle.They other thing that really bother's me is how important it seem to show how strong women are. The power of women yeah... Men are lazy, dumb and useless like thor in this movie and women are strong and save the day like Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Gamora etc.Marvel's writers must understand that Easter eggs, some action at the end of the film and showing the power of feminity do not make up for a bad script.the only thing that I really like in this movie is that finally we saw some hero die.",

After the events of Infinity War, which did not last for infinity, cell phone gamer Thermos got his wish he deleted half his apps on his phone, after collecting all the Bejeweled gems. So what now? Well, those of the game app The Avengers that are left, get mad, so they stroll over to Thermos' place and behead him, rather easily... the excuse is, cause he was worn out and weak after using the stones, yea ok lets go with that. So what now? The End? Right??? No, they're not satisfied with the realization that in war people die, even the good guys, so the answer is: Time Travel. Thus a convoluted plan is born to travel through time, getting the stones back to create the game glove to bring all the dead folks back. So by now I've sure you've seen it, so spoilers be damned and my issue with the ending... The Captain America time line... The movie states, all other time travel movies are wrong, they're rules are right. You jump through to a different time, that is your reality now. So the Avengers plan works, though they screw up each timeline they go to, giving Disney enough material to make alternate universe versions of the same movie forever, oh wait, they do that now... The final act is for the Captain to bring the final stone back, to his original time and come back, to i guess rebuild and get ready for Avengers 5, i dunno. But he decides to stay back then and make a life with his lost lady love, creating his own new timeline, where he still got all muscley apparently, however this would mean that all the events of the MCU did not take place in the Captains new timeline, so when he randomly shows up as an old man to the spot where he left the other timeline, a timeline he ended by leaving it...the events of his life were drastically different and in creating this new time line, the others are null and void because they now exist in an alternate universe where old Steve Rogers does not. If your gonna say all other time travel movies are wrong, at least follow your own rules. Filmbufftim on FB.",

    "reviewBody": "I didn't find this movie all that interesting. I felt it was about as good as Infinity Wars. This film feels like a complete ripoff of the last episode of Star Trek Voyager that was also called Endgame and also involved time travel. I don't mind when time travel is used in a movie or tv show as long as it makes some sense and somewhat consistent within the universe and doesn't leave giant gaping holes everywhere. This movie failed hard with the time travel stuff. I don't recall time travel being an aspect in the MCU, so whipping out the good old time travel trope randomly required way too much suspension of disbelief for me.The fact that Tony Stark created a time machine overnight just blew my mind that someone actually thought it was a good idea to put it in the movie. The Professor Hulk stuff mind numbingly ridiculous. I'm confused as to why it was decided that Banner would just be Professor Hulk for this movie. It didn't add anything to the movie and made his character boring. Alcoholic, overweight comedic relief Thor destroyed Thor's character. It's not really even explained why he turned into an alcoholic bum. He decapitates Thanos within the first 5 minutes of the movie and the next time we see him, he's an alcoholic raging over video games. Honestly, nothing is really explained in this 3 hour movie. The directors thought it was best to like 90 minutes that added zilch to the filmThe time travel in the film renders all the other films in the MCU as pointless. There are no consequences for anyone's actions. The Avengers failed in Infinity War, but good thing Tony Stark created a time machine to fix past failures. Paradoxes be damned and the \"rules\" of time travel can just be changed at anytime as this movie did.The thing at the end with Captain America putting back all the stones in their original time line didn't make sense as how he'd be able to even do that. The movie couldn't be bothered to show him doing that either. Him going back to 1940 to be with Peggy Carter doesn't make sense either and messes up his character. Did he just sit and watch all this bad stuff happen throughout the years? Why didn't it create an alternate universe?Just all around dull movie. It would've been better if the Avengers traveled to an alternate universe to get the stones instead of time travel. Then there wouldn't have been as many gaping holes in this film. It doesn't seem like Infinity Wars and Endgame were thought through.",

    "reviewBody": "Do you remember your least favourite episodes from the Star Trek series?\nYou know the ones I'm talking about. They involve time travel.\nYup, when you have no idea how to fix the writing mess you've made, reach into your bag of hacks and pull out time travel.\nSo too have the writers of the latest Marvel film.\nWorse yet, it's a mirror image of the previous Marvel Avengers film. Only this time, we have the heroes digging around in the past tracking down all the stones (as opposed to Thanos doing it) and a giant pointless CGI fight at the end (just like the last time around.)I couldn't figure out how the film was 3 hours long, until they started getting the stones, each section is played out seemingly just to pad the runtime. When the Hulk puts on the Iron-Man created infinity glove and snaps his fingers to bring everyone back, all the returned folks take it quite well, just a quip and a node of \"oh, we were dead, and now we're back? That's fine.\"This film glosses over so many more interesting aspects of the plot in a rush to get to the CGI fest that is the end.Sure, the film will make billions from all the fans (and let's face it, this is for the fans only) but it doesn't deserve to. It's a hackneyed mess.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not for me",
    "reviewBody": "Reading the reviews and overall rating, clearly there was an audience for this movie, but I wasn't part of it.For me it was way too long and had way too many characters. Each character apparently had to have at least one super hero jump landing. A very overused and tired device. And, each character had to have at least one Zoolander, blue steel stare to the camera, before any fighting started. As these moments took up about an hour of the filming time, perhaps that explains the long run time.Then the story negates any lasting impact from the previous movie. Everything from the previous battle is irrelevant, because we can just go back in time and fix it. So assumably when the studios want to cash in again, Thanos can build a time machine after Infinity War, find out what happened in Endgame, and go back and fix that outcome. Next movie, the avengers steal the time machine and create another fix. Then in about another two sequels or so, the whole battle can be fought out again in the old west, with Doc, Marty, and Spider-Man driving the delorean, after some funny scenes where Thor helps him get his licence.The best way I can comment on this movie, is that I went to see it in the cinema with a 24yo friend. About half way through, I looked at him and he was asleep. I considered waking him up, but realised that whatever he was dreaming about, it had to be better than the movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Omissions and Plot Holes Galore!",
    "reviewBody": "SPOILERS Ahead!!! Turn back now!!Endgame brings MORE plot holes and nonsense. How can this be??Part One of the Avengers movie (Infinity War) oozed into theaters in Spring of 2018. It was not what I expected and I was pretty vocal in my dislike of the film. I stand by that review.Spring of 2019 brought us Part Two (Endgame). I motored over to my local multiplex and plopped down to watch and be amazed. As I sat munching my popcorn before the feature I kept thinking. \"It's going to be okay. It's really going to be okay. It can't be as bad as the first film. It's going to be okay.\"It was NOT okay.How is it possible that this film is even worse than Part One? That should not be possible, right? But it is. I'll attribute most of the 'bad' to the fact that the movies were shot simultaneously. For some reason the whole Betty Botter tongue twister is rattling around in my head. I suppose because the Russos needed some better butter to make their bitter batter better. Evidently, they couldn't find any.Because the 'batter' is bitter y'all!So many things went wrong here. Let's start at the beginning. We spend the first hour of this snooze fest in a never ending loop of 'where's waldo' to catch up on some of the folk that are left after Thanos snapped his fingers and killed off half of life in the universe in Infinity War. Stark is floating in space with Nebula running out of oxygen and food. Everyone is depressed. Thor is super depressed. Enter Captain Marvel who brings Stark and Nebula to earth. Does she stay to help? Nope. She flies off to help other planets that don't have an 'avengers'. Whoa, wait...I thought she was supposed to save the day, trounce Thanos. I thought this would be her moment. No? We have to save the world and find Thanos on our own? Huh! The team decides to find Thanos, take back the stones and reverse the first snapping. Thor whacks off Thanos' head when they learn Thanos destroyed the stones and there will be no do over.The snooze fest continues 'Five Years Later'.Ant Man escapes the quantum realm (plot hole...cos how did he do that, exactly?) He finds Black Widow and Captain America and explains that he's only been gone 5 hours 'cause 'time moves differently in the quantum realm.' (say what?) Captain America is leading a 'touchy feely' grief counseling encounter group with one of the directors (Joe Russo) providing a cameo as a grieving spouse. This was our gay moment that we were promised and it almost slips by unnoticed.Moving on.The group approaches Stark to do the time travel reset. He initially blows them off because he has a life and a kid. However, he puts all that to the side because of the loss of Peter Parker. We gotta have Spiderman back because his next movie is in the pipeline. Bruce Banner and the Hulk have found the peace Jekyll and Hyde never did and are happily signing autographs, taking selfies and blissfully not remembering that Hulk wussed out in Infintity War because Thanos kicked his green butt. Thor is living in New Asgard in squalor with his buddies Korg and Miek, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, porking up on snacks and developing a substantial beer belly. Hawkeye has turned into a vigilante and is systematically wiping out bad guys to avenge his family and improve the world. Yeah, whatever works.The whole 'stone heist' segment of the film was like a bad version of any of the Ocean's movies except all the bad that went on was not thought out ahead or planned. In fact, the movie jokes about the improbability of time travel by referencing a ton of movies (from Back to the Future to Star Trek) and saying 'that's not the way it works'. One problem...they never really explain how time travel 'really' works because nothing in the whole process was consistent. Do you or don't you interact with your former self? Maybe, maybe not. Will all be returned to its 'pre Thanos' snapped' glory? Not really. Will all our favorites come back to life? Ehhh...not quite (Loki and Vision are not brought back and I'm STILL upset about that!) Will what you do in the past change your timeline? Depends on what you want to do? What happens if you decide to stay in the past or your past self comes to the future? Why quibble over minutiae? Plot hole after plot hole opens up and we're supposed to just swallow the blue pill and believe whatever we're told...however cockeyed that may be.Captain Marvel does come back to take out Thanos' ship and join with the other women (in a heavy handed obligatory feminist moment that is so contrived) to do battle with Thanos and keep him away from the glove. I had hoped that this would be Captain Marvel's moment. I thought she would put on the glove, snap her fingers and we'd all go back to business as usual. But no. She makes no attempt to put the glove on herself. Really?? Tony Stark uses his tech to transfer the stones from Thanos' glove to his, snap his fingers, and turn Thanos and all his minions to dust. But...but...we had been lead to believe that Captain Marvel was the pinnacle of super heroes. Guess Captain Marvel didn't get that memo. So why did we even need a Captain Marvel origin story? We could have had a Black Widow origin story. We were already invested in her character. Plus Scarlett is a better actress than Brie. She just is.What is so frustrating is none of this is a surprise. Not one thing. We know that Steve is going to stay with Peggy. We know that Black Widow is going to sacrifice herself for the Soul Stone. We know the effects of the first snapping will be successfully reversed. The Russos telegraph every single plot point (and I use the word 'plot' loosely because there wasn't one). The dialog was so basic that I found myself speaking it before the characters did. I hate when that happens because it's never a good sign in a first-run film that I've never seen and which I did not Google or read a single review.This film was a monumental waste of time. I waited ten years for this. I waited TEN years for THIS??\nI rated the movie a '3' because I got to see some old favs. I was glad to see Rene Russo as Frigga. Loki, of course and the Strike Team leader Rumlow.I'm sure this movie will make a ton of money. Most Marvel films do. I usually see each of the films in theaters more than once. Not this time. I'm done. I will not give any more of my hard earned cash to this effort. Not one penny more. Neither should you.",

The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained!

In this movie, however; and in infinity war Thanos is a big ugly bald crybaby and only wants to kill half the universe because he thinks that will stop overpopulation or some nonsense which it won't permanently the population will just go back to what it was eventually he solved nothing if he wanted to stop overpopulation he should have killed 100% of the universe's population along with the annoying guardians of the galaxy.\nAnd then they just do a back to the future and resurrect everyone which is stupid and cliché and meaningless because no one died, nothing of value happened, nothing had a lasting impact for more than a few months blah blah blah they killed iron man thankfully, since he wan't the iron man that Stan lee and jack Kirby created in the 60's he was just a shell of man pun not intended (in case you didn't know his nickname is ole' shell head) this Iron Man helped ruin the last Spiderman movie but he will likely help ruin the next one too along with help from all the bad writing.\nAlso, Thanos' costume looks bad I hate how they have to make all the superhero costumes look more realistic or really more like pretentious modern art with weird textures. But back to the movie, it looks like it has over used CGI all marvel movies are just big cartoons with real actors in the old cartoons from the 90's and early 2000's looked better and the action looked realistic within the universe rather than jarring. Tired of the marvels they are all the same except infinity war where everyone's least favorite characters die exempt fake ant man as seen in this film, which is not as good because all the annoying characters come back.",

    "reviewBody": "...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of \"Avengers: Infinity war\" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel.",

    "reviewBody": "We are up to number... 15?? 20?? Whatever... in Disney's desperate attempts to wring every last cent out of what at the time was a clever new take on super hero movies with Iron Man. So I shouldn't be surprised that the writers and editors are phoning it in by now but it really shows.\nI would suggest the writers get a copy of any of the top 100 books on screenwriting... any one at all... and read the very first lesson of any of those books, you know, the one where they say \"show don't tell\". I guarantee that we didn't need 80% of the movie to be exposition from the characters, especially in a superhero movie. I am sure the CGI team, you know, the people who take up most of the credits, could have fired up the Unreal Engine and pumped out a few more video game cut scenes to fill us in.\nBut I shouldn't blame this all on the writers, the editors pretty much looked at all of the footage, every last scrap of boring exposition and said \"whatever, just chuck it all in\". My girlfriend actually skipped a minute of dialogue at one point and it made no difference at all.\nI would complain about the obvious cringe, especially during that lame scene at the end but so many of Marvel (property of the Mouse) fans probably see that cringe as a positive aspect. Whatever, it's hard to find a movie with less cringe nowadays, so it's to be expected.\nThere were a couple of great laugh out loud jokes and fat Thor was great, not to mention the Thor/Starlord dialogue.\nBut I can't recommend sitting through 2.5 hours of exposition and awkward CGI for the few brilliant moments.\nI guess you could look at it as a learning experience, Avengers showed us how a huge ensemble superhero movie could be done right and Avengers Endgame showed us how to do it poorly.",

It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends.

    "reviewBody": "People won't agree with me because they are blinded by the hype and grandeur of the movie and the way it has been marketed. But this is one movie that has dozen of flaws, stupidity and unnecessary forced humour scenes.\n1. How on earth did Tony figure out time-travel is possible and perfectly safe in just a night, without any failures. Just for the sake of argument, he had help from Ant-man(which isn't shown in the movie), but let's just assume it, why a mind like Tony, the smartest on earth didn't figure it out earlier, why the avengers didn't even discuss time travel earlier during those 5 years ?2. Captain Marvel has disappeared from the entire movie, honestly Rocket had x3 times more screen appearance than the strongest marvel character. The avengers don't even speak her name or call out for help when going back in time to collect the stones. The director didn't even talk about it so the people watching it completely forget about her. And then she suddenly appears in the end scene.3. The entire plot is very mediocre, quite stupid and hastily made.4. Why o why did you ruin Thor, what was the reason behind it ? Don't tell me that he was depressed and defeated so he became a like ginger. Because 5 years of beer drinking and getting fat and all it took was 5 minutes of absolutely no convincing to get back into the game. Highly stupid and unnecessary.6. So much of time and effort and some amazing scenes are put into Infinity war to get Thor his new axe. And now the hammer is suddenly just back. Because the present Thor goes back to past and just takes the hammer and returns back. So what does the past Thor uses now ? And why put so much effort to create an awesome axe when you again brought back hammer. Absolutely no sense.8. A very minute but noticeable point. Apparently normal humans(clint and natasha) can breathe on the other planets without any issues, they all have same atmosphere and gravity like earth. For someone who is a fan of space and galaxy genre, finds it really stupid.9. When you go back and take infinity stones , and disturb that past reality it creates problems, okay that's standard time travel issue, so the solution is to put back infinity stones and everything is good. That's fine.\nBut the hammer was taken from the past Thor and wasn't returned. But no body cares about that. Apparently magically a new hammer will appear on its own somehow. From such a large scale franchise, one of the ugliest time travel stuff.\nI can go on and on and on about the bad points in the movie because it has no end.\nThe emotional content of the movie is pretty good, especially the scenes involving Tony, pepper and spiderman.\nYes there are mistakes in every movie. But one can't expect such stupid stuff from Endgame. The largest movie ever in past two decades after having a runtime of over 180 minutes.\nHIGHLY DISAPPOINTING.\nInfinity War was the end to me. This is just unacceptable.",

What has gone wrong. I was looking forward to this film so much but was so disappointed. If you want action and fun go watch John Wick 3, Wow that is a film especially compared to this dribble.Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push. The rest is just a load of rubbish.So disappointed, won't be wasting my hard earned money on Marvel again.",

Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own.

The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him.

    "reviewBody": "Well first off, Infinity War is one of my favourite movies of all time, and I feel the expectations I had built from that, has impacted how I feel about this movie.Their are some really beautiful scenes and some great fan service which deserves a mention, in a movie that feels like a stepping stone to promote some of the characters that recently failed in the comics. We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of the MCUNow onto the movie:The plot line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like in Dragon all we can just \"Wish back\" all those who died. Its basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.Once again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny, fat child with mommy issuesAlthough there were some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little in the way of action and because the story was so all over the place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished in this movie.As always Tony is amazing, throwing out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great too.Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it, but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the plot. Like they were more concerned with paying homage to EVERY character ever, before writing a great narrative.",

We got those answer by a stunning, realistic, dramatic starting scene.However, devolopment phase of the movie is a SCANDAL. Too many boring staff going on, trying to find a solution for the making the world nice again (I should say that post apocalyptic scenes are really illogical, people still sorrow after 5 years later and there is nothing going on the world except japan mafia. LOL) and they come up with a idea of TIME MACHINE.Top level of creativity showed itself around here. Thanks to script writers nice job!Two geniuses, Mark Ruffalo and Robert D. Jr. figures out quickly principles of time travel and team gathers up together for the ENDGAME. Wow.Conclusion phase of the movie was a disaster as well. Not gonna get into too much detail but everything should be ended differently if you consider all knowledge we gathered from Doctor Strange and Thanos.Captain Marvel wouldn't showed up in the Infinity Wars Thanos Fight last time because she was busy with \"Universe Problems\" while half of all living being destroyed, Thanks for the OP character to getting involved to that case in the second time, and all is well again. Movie finishes just like my review finishes.People are not evaluating the movie, they are just here to applause everything that were made from Marvel. They think this movie is the last Avengers movie. Thanks to those DUMBS (Sorry for my real opinion) economics of the Avengers movies will always be profitable.",

I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.\nI left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix.",

    "reviewTitle": "The reason for film/TV to stay out of time travel.",
    "reviewBody": "I have watched movies and rated them 1/10 without writing a review. But Avengers: Engame build up so much momentum with Infinity War and all that PR upfront, positioning A:E as the ultimate finally of the MCU that the failing of the movie is ultimately that - the sad finally of the MCU.Cinematography: Well done, good CGI as in previous films. Some scenes were shot to dramatic for the actual content of that scene but that's pathos (not a relative of Thanos) in American cinema. Some surprise moments that would are shot perfectly highlighting them (Captain America).Storyline:\n*If you don't mind spending the ticket money please watch the movie and decide for yourself.*\nTime Travel is a tricky concept with different approaches but there are some theories established and they simply make certain developments during or after time travel impossible / illogical. At this point, I can get behind Stark figuring out time travel with Quantum mechanics. After that the problems for that movie start...A) Illogic of time travel:\nThe group enables Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos to follow them into the 5 year future where he tries to grab all stones at once. This Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos gets killed in the future which makes it impossible and illogical for all the things happening from the time that Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos left his timeline, e.g. the Infinity War movie and all this Thanos did in his quest for the stones.\nIf Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos leaves his time (past) into the future and no Infinity War happens, Starks Timeline with a daughter also would not happen. Nevertheless, she keeps on existing after Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos is killed in the future. Zero logic.B) The handling of the stones:\nThanos has his gauntlet specially made in Nidavellir with the power of a star as all stones together hold all of reality. Now all it takes is Stark and some nano-tech to handle them and channel their power? Not realistic by the logic of the MCU explained before.\nB.a.) For Ronan (Guardians I) it was almost impossible to wield one infinity stone and the Guardians barely and only survived by splitting the energy between them. The Hulk is almost killed but survives because it's Gamma Ray- okay. But that Stark simply can put on all stones and is not instantly ripped apart makes all previous told content irrelevant and makes this facet of the MCU ridiculous. It's a story line decision to kill of Stark for dramatic reasons but there would have been much better, logical ways. Other characters like a god (Thor) could have handled the stones by the unrealistic Iron Man gauntlet adopting to the persons hand.Over all, a white board, pen and a few hours would have shown the writers where the illogic happens and how to make it right in the sense of simple reasonable logic. This however is an unworthy end to the MCU and previous film.",

    "reviewTitle": "LOOK AT FAT BUMBLING THOR AND LAUGH and ignore the plot holes pls",
    "reviewBody": "I realise that I'm in the minority, here, but I walked out of this...this thing really, really angry. Oh, it's a spectacle, to be sure, but an empty one. To each their own, and more power to you if you enjoyed the film, but I couldn't. Why? A number of reasons. It'll be wordy, but at least you can see why exactly I only gave it a three-star-rating - and this is coming from a person who mostly reviews things she loves.\nAnyway, here goes.\nFirst, characterisation. Oh, boy. Let's start with a spiteful nit-pick. Those kept piling up, which is why I mention it. The Asgardians. I have a question, writers: why are the Asgardians fishermen now? Seriously, what gives? Asgard was a highly developed society with technology so advanced, it looked like magic. They had Star-Trek-esque power shields. They had hovercraft. They are not fishermen. Is that because of Norway? Not everyone fishes there, either and also, Asgardians are not Norwegians. It's like if you live close to a river and you specialise in engineering energy shields, someone suddenly pushes you into a boat, and goes: \"Fish!!!!\" Sorry, but no.\nThen, there's the real problem: Fat Bumbling Thor. What was that? No, seriously. What was that? That's not Thor. That drunken, stoned, lardy, snickering, obnoxious fool is not Thor. Remember the first movie? Where he was a bit of an impulsive, boisterous tool but still overall noble, courageous, selfless, and cultured? The Thor who created some situational comedy without turning into a pitiable punchline? That's Thor.\nCharacter derailment for the sake of komedy is not funny, nor is it excusable. It's just bad writing. It's gimmicky and I hate it.\nDon't even get me started on how Nebula kills her past self without consequences or how years of character development for Gamora get wiped away. Awesome, that. Top notch.\nThe other characters don't fare all that well, either. What was it with Tony suddenly being \"tired and finally ready to rest\" or whatever (paraphrasing, here)? Since when? And Steve staying in the past and playing houseboy whilst Hydra run rampant and his best buddy gets tortured is maybe the worst bit of pathetic \"happy ending\" I've ever come across with. That's not something he would do. If he had a shot at saving Bucky in the past, he would. He wouldn't be this selfish. I also wonder how exactly that worked in everyday life. What did he do all day? The dishes? Peggy's life would be drastically different with Steve around. None of the future events would have happened, and there is simply no handwaving this away or ignoring it. The reason I'm harping on all these details is that added together, they just don't make sense. Everything is just off, and we're supposed to just go along with it like it doesn't reek of sloppily put-together, bad fanfiction? No. No, thanks. I'll pass.\nThat's all bad enough, but then, the plot kicks in, and boy howdy, is it a doozy. Now, I realise that time travel stories need to be taken with a healthy heap of salt (pun unintentional but fitting), yes, but I guess it's the entire package that made me so mad. It's the cavalier attitude, the nonsense, the lack of intelligence, the lack of logic, and all the la-dee-dah accompanying it. First of all, there's the \"oh, it's not like in Terminator and Star Trek\". What is it like, then? If I travel into the past, it's my future? Okay, so riddle me this: if someone goes to the past and kills their past self, then they're still dead in the future and will, therefore, never travel into the past. That's a head-scratcher, but how does the movie deal with it? TERMINATOR WAS WRONG!!!!!! HEY, LOOK, SHINY CARKEYS!!!! That's pretty much it. It doesn't make sense on even the most basic level. Even on first viewing, when we're supposed to just cackle at Fat Bumbling Thor and gawp at the big explosions, the whole plot simply falls apart. Cause and effect are a thing. If someone cuts off my finger in 1999, I'll still be Frodo in 2019. You can't just go THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, make a wannabe-snarky quip, and then movie on to the next hilarious hijinks. What outrageous thing will Fat Bumbling Thor do next? How much more amusing will this light-hearted version of the Hulk be (never mind how all his problems just got magically solved for the sake of hurr-hurr-funny).\nAnd how exactly did Steve get the MacGuffins back to the exact same moment in time? That's just virtually impossible, because there were always people around. Take the glowstick of destiny, for instance. Hail Hydra? Okay, so that means that Winter Soldier etc. didn't happen. Nothing past those movies happened, because how - how - did Steve get that thing back without anyone seeing him? There were people around at all times (even Howard Stark in the 1970s). How did he get the ether back to Jane? Did he sneak up on her? Even if, she would have noticed, and that would have changed everything. What about Natasha? How did that pan out? The lol-I-kill-me-first scene, and then Steve shows up and it's all hunky-dory? Why is she still dead? If it never happened, then she shouldn't be dead. But I guess the movie told me her death is final, so it's all good. Tell me, movie, don't show. I don't need sense or logic. It was in the script, so it must be true. And what about Loki? Not only did he (as per the rules of the movie) create an alternate timeline by stealing the Tesseract, but he's gone now from the main one, isn't he? And none of these taking-away-bringing-back gigs affected the other events occurring simultaneously in the MCU timeline? How?\nThe scenes went on for too long, too, especially the \"comedic\" ones. The one relatively in the beginning, with Scott and Bruce and those kids...yikes. It went on forever. The joke wasn't that clever or amusing in the first place, and it overstayed its welcome like nobody's business. And they kept doing that over and over (o hai Fat Bumbling Thor).\nSigh.\nThe problem is that all these logic failings, the bad characterisation, and the shucks-ain't-we-clever-thinking-is-for-dopes instants pile up. The movie feels like a clip show: a bunch of komedy or action sketches sewn together, written by folks who think their audience has the attention span of a tomato. That's the worst part. The lack of effort to tell a coherent story. Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to feel sad when Tony bit it? Because I didn't care.\nIt just made me angry.\nI'm only giving it three stars because the effects were shiny and it's not the actors' fault.",

    "reviewTitle": "**SPOILERS** Avengers: The Last Jedi",
    "reviewBody": "\"It wasn't as good as Infinity War.\" That was all I could say as I stumbled home after two in the morning. It's taken some time, but I'm starting to understand why.The biggest problem I had with this film was how all the superheroes seemed to act as if \"The Snap\" happened only to them and no one else. The entire first act shows the cast depressed because they lost, and because of who they lost among their group. While this is understandable, it seems to be the only thing they care about. They only want to avenge the loss of their own loved ones, not the horror suffered by the rest of Earth.This isn't just my interpretation of the writing - the effect on the rest of humanity is almost completely hidden from view. As to the larger global cataclysm, we only get a few glimpses - Hawkeye's family, a memorial in San Francisco, a few people who show up to Captain America's grief counseling group. Other than that, we're merely told about the larger effects of that moment, such as when Black Widow states the Earth's governments are in ruins. It too well concealed the terror suffered by so many others on Earth, as if the writers themselves weren't sure how to convey the magnitude of the act.At the same time, the film assumes the surviving humans all know that Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet were the reason behind half of the world disappearing. This raised several questions:First - how would they know that? Was humanity ever told that Thanos would wipe out half of existence if The Avengers failed? Do they even know what the Infinity Gauntlet is? Who would've been there to see it when it happened outside Wakanda's secluded African community? When people saw others turn to dust, wouldn't they think it was terrorism, a plague, or something entirely different?Second, if they were told, who did it? How did everyone react when they heard? And wouldn't they be upset at The Avengers for failing to stop Thanos? Why, five years later, would some kids walk up to The Hulk and take a selfie with him as if nothing had happened? You'd think our heroes would have been chased into hiding, not hanging out in their perfectly functioning headquarters to quip at each other.Much like \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and the Anime \"Sword Art Online,\" \"Endgame\" relies on a sudden jump forward in time to avoid answering these and other compelling questions. It is in the five years after \"The Snap\" that we could have learned more about humanity's response to the disaster, and how if at all The Avengers were blamed. After all, we know from the very beginning of the MCU, when Tony Stark reveals his secret identity, that humans know superheroes exist. It's these interactions between humans and the heroes that have driven much of the narrative in the MCU.But instead, at this most critical time, we're simply moved ahead to a moment of tenuous calm, thus allowing the Marvel brand of humor to continue despite the unfathomable tragedy. To the film's detriment, this isn't the most interesting time for the story to take place. And to make it worse, humanity has absolutely no role in shaping the narrative of the story. We're not even certain everyone comes back after The Avengers craft a gauntlet of their own - it's all done symbolically, without any of the emotion or consequence.As if gripped by the same depression of the film's characters, we're then thrown head-long into a ridiculous time travel plot that fills the film's second half. Thanks to the film's greatest hero - a rat - Ant-Man returns from out of nowhere, and while stuck in the Quantum Realm also seems to suddenly understand everything about time travel despite being a common thief. Tony Stark's concept of building a time machine also comes to him from out of nowhere. It would've been interesting to see this plan be an act of desperation by brutally depressed characters, all of them knowing the act is impossible, but just looking for something to do.But, of course, it works, and the film then partakes in its true passion - celebrating the MCU itself. Like a terrible clip show from a long-running show, much of what follows is everything you've already seen from nearly two dozen films, re-enacted all over again. It's quaint for hardcore fans of the series, but for me, it left me wondering if something more interesting could've been done in its place. The film can't even escape making the same mistake so many other films do by couching their time-travel plan in terms of still other movies, like \"Back To The Future\" and even \"Hot Tub Time Machine.\"The inevitable over-indulgent fight signals the end of the film, featuring a chorus line of all the characters coming back as if preparing to take a final bow. It's the big applause moment of the film, but somehow still comes off rushed. We don't get any understanding of what it was like when each of them came back, and what effect it had on their loved ones left behind. We don't understand - other than a few lines from Spider-Man - what it felt like to be one of the murdered from Infinity War. It's at this moment you realize why they didn't show anyone else come back after the second \"Snap\" - once again, humanity took a back seat to allow the superheroes a dramatic entrance. But, for a three-hour film, it really lacked the weight the writers were clearly going for.In the fight itself, we're treated to many absurdities. The maligned Captain Marvel, who after nearly ending the film all by herself in the first five minutes literally told the audience \"you're not going to see me for a while,\" shoots in from out of nowhere and effortlessly destroys a ship, just as she had in her own film. She then joins a group of female superheroes who pointlessly pose for a moment, then unlike the male characters screaming and attacking, choose to scream and attack. On top of this \"Force Is Female\" crap, the whole sequence is shot like a DC fight scene, complete with an ugly brown filter over the colorful characters. But, hey, when it's all over, Thanos gets to die a second time.To round things off, the film follows \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" in gleefully letting the past die. While Iron Man gets an epic and dignified death - unwillingly, having started a family of his own - others aren't so fortunate. Captain America voluntarily becomes old, handing over his shield to his black friend Falcon. More wokeness ensues when Thor, transformed by depression into \"The Big Lebowski,\" hands over the keys to his sad little village to the Valkyrie woman from \"Ragnarok\" who can't act. One after the other, your favorite superheroes survive their greatest challenge only to voluntarily give up the reigns to a group far less interesting or talented. Then the actors sign their names \"Star Trek\" style, you wait 11 minutes for no after credits sequence, and its finally time to go pee.Once again, even in this biggest and most anticipated superhero film, this is yet another example of writers not taking the time to play with an idea and make their story the very best it could be. It's not a terrible film, but it's not a complete one, either. Tragically caught between racial and sexual politics, rabid fans, and Disney corporate, it lets a little too much of the outside world water-down a good story.",

You'll still have people in the cites just half as many.

If you want a super hero story that's intelligent, incredibly well-written, and with really interesting characters, go watch that instead... And in the MCU context, the first Avengers film is a much better example of good writing and directing, where the characters actually had some wit and.. yeah, well... character....The best thing I can say about Avengers: Endgame is that it very early on killed off Thanos and the Infinity Stones. That was unexpected and opened up the possibilities for the rest of the film. Except that it went straight on to a classic time-travel solution and makes a big deal out of this not being at all like described in any other film (except that it's exactly the same) along with an abundance of other cliches and plot holes (well described in the many other critical reviews here). The characters and their lines were generally bland and completely without the wit and bite as seen in the earlier Joss Whedon versions. And the ending was just as painfully slow as LotR: The Return of the King (yet another over-hyped blockbuster) with long-drawn-out overly sentimental scenes that added nothing to the story.6/10 = OK (just)",

The pouted pauses are with dearest family and friends in a warm sunny glow.The only funny thing, for a moment, was Thor.They could cut the movie by 2h35 and it would be immensely better.",

    "reviewTitle": "Weak",
    "reviewBody": "Im a very critical movie watcher, so if you are not prepared for nitpicking than please understand my review might not be for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, now lets get to the juicy things I wish the movie had done instead. I know its a Disney movie but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see the most epic comic book movie in history if they changed a few things.1. Thanos never kills anyone(besides loki *maybe*) A. SOME people died in this movie (black widow, Iron Man) but they died from heroic sacrifice. Not from Thanos's power. B. I wanted to see Thanos kill Iron man, or Thor, or Any major character. After the movie 3-5 people should have been dead and your like, What now? But instead almost everyone is alive and you can already see the next movies coming out soon. C. In Infinty War Thanos was the biggest baddest guy in the universe, In this movie the avengers are fighting a new Thanos that isnt even that bad ass or cool or anything, thats why he should have killed someone on the battle field like Captain America. To show the strenght and might and danger of Thanos. I like Capstain America's happy ending, but I would have liked it even more if he died to Thanos and Hulk or Thor got revenge, which leads to point 2.2. Thor, Hulk, Capetian America, Iron man, Captain Marvel, or Someone should have killed Thanos in battle on the battle field. Imagine if Captain America died by Thanos hands, and HULK goes into a rage and kills Thanos. Then they take the glove off of his and and do the snap. Then Hulk would be a legend and that would be part of the history forever. Hulk Thanos killer, or Thor the Asgaurd god who killed Thanos. 2A. Instead legends like Thor and Hulk are reduced to side comic characters like the antler Gaurdian of the galaxy lady and rocket racoon. Thor even leaves at the end with the Racoon and Gaurdians, and seems to join their crew and set up for the next comedy action movie..... which is funny and great. But I would have preferred the fighter warrior Thor. The Thor that opened a sun onto himself to reforge his hammer. What the heck happened to the Thor who almost killed Thanos In Infinity war? why did we get this comedy relief fat Thor. Yes he is really funny. But I would have preferred him to fight toe to toe with Thanos, instead of make a few jokes. 2B. HULK got the same treatment as a comic/clown. He can kill Thanos. Hulk literally never got mad and angry and started smashing people. He never smashed Thanos or fought him at all in this movie.3. To many emotional scenes, Hawkeye walking his dog...etc. Tony Stark doing a pov youtube video documentary about if he wants to fight or not. These are the greatest fighters in history in the greatest fight against their greatest enemy. Show some more fight scenes. Show some intensity and tension. They went back in time so easy and got the stones so easy as they are cracking jokes. Black widow soul gem scene was good, but they still needed some fight scenes. Someone should have died to retrieve one of the stones. or should have got stuck in time or something.4.Fake gauntlet. Why did Thanos go to the Asgard holy weapon site to make that gauntlet, the only thing that can hold the infinity stones, if iron man can just hold the stones on his robot arm. I thought the Gauntlet was special and magical. I dont like that scene at all. Why couldn't someone just kill Thanos and then they use the gauntlet to snap after they pull it off his dead hand. They wanted it to be more tense, but it just created a plot hole and just breaks the reality and power of the gauntlet and the stones and all of the lore.5. So my main gripe with the movie even though I enjoyed it for funs sake, was that no real consequences happened. Only Theoretical consequences people sacrificing themselves for the greater good etc boring storyline. I wanted Thanos the biggest bad guy in comic books, to have done something of weight. In the end he did nothing. He should have killed Iron man. He should have killed Captain America or Thor, or Scarlett witch or all three of them. His plan got completely foiled and he personally did no damage. weak. Thanos is weak, he couldn't kill one measly earth defender.6, Captain marvel flying around for no reason doing no damage, weak.Infinity war had more tension, more fights, and more deaths in battle. I am highly disappointed from this great movie. Highly Dissapointing Great Movie",

There will be all the time 2 people exactly the same, one from that period of time {(for marvel Endgame Movie) past} person and the (Future) person.Captain America (future) goes back in the past and marries Peggy Carter and stays in the past also gets back his unbroken shield to Sam Wilson.Doesn't this tamper with the past. Having an extra human being also with the actual Captain America Shield. If means the (past) Captain America doesn't have the Shield.Also Nebula (future) kills the (past) Nebula. Doesn't this erase herself from existence. As without the past self, the future self cannot live on.There was also a scene where Iron Man and Ant Man steals the Space Stone.So a secured and lock briefcase opens with a drop to the ground, without any force. Also Loki disappeared with the Space Stone in 2012 which will also cause problem with the time vortex. As something happened that weren't suppose to happen.Also the Avengers all get their stones without any hassle or fight. Something spicy should have been added.What I mean is new villain.It looks as if Marvel was in a hurry to wind up all years and years of work in 1 last film untill the new phase starts.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not a patch on it's predecessor",
    "reviewBody": "Infinity War is possibly one of the greatest movies there ever was. It has superheroes, comedy and suspense in spades and has you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours. If you're not laughing you are biting your fingernails.Endgame is not half the film of its predecessor. It could have been a masterpiece if the writers had only continued the same formula. Instead they turned it into something resembling an Ironman and Captain America tribute.One of the most appealing things about Infinity War was that all of the heroes had major parts, had amusing lines and were in situations that made you care about them. Endgame features appearances of about 1 minute for the majority of the Avengers except Ironman, Captain America, Antman and Hawkeye. Even Thor who had a lot of screentime is diminished and for no particular reason. I mean, this god nearly killed Thanos, yet in the next movie is reduced to a comedy sideshow?In all honesty the movie feels rushed, it's like they had a timeline to get it finished and went with the script that was the best of a poor bunch. I mean, what was the point of Captain Marvel and the major movie before? She featured for about 30 seconds in 3 hours. Infinity War insinuated she would have a major say in the outcome yet her screentime was barely worth a credit which was the same for most of the other Avengers. In fact, why market this movie as Avengers at all?After all of the hype and the absolute triumph that is Infinity War, two and a half hours with little more than talking, then one fight scene resembling, but not a patch on, the Wakanda fight does not give this movie a right to a good rating. MCU phase 3 should have finished with Infinity War, on a high at the end of a rollercoaster with questions that need to be answered. Endgame leaves the questions answered, but does it in a tame, humourless way.Instead of moving to phase four with a bang, Marvel have gone with a fingersnap...Saying that, at least I can now say I have a body like Thor!",

Now, we get \"good\" or \"very good\" and in comparison it seems almost bad.\nMy issue is not how the film is made. But with the story they chose to tell:\n1. Thanos can't be the stronger villain without his gauntlet. That's poor writing.\n2. Captain Marvel and Captain America are NOT equally strong (when fighting Thanos).\n3. Stormbreaker was this amazing weapon in Infinity War. It beat Thanos with all stones in his gauntlet. Now it's just as steong as the hammer.\n4. Thor has just found his purpose and strength in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Now he is a joke.\n5. The time travel is, well, how itz always is.

    "reviewBody": "This is the saddest review I have ever had to write. After the culmination of all the films and the Snap at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars they blew it. Fat Thor was funny for about 5 minutes then was just annoying, the Hulk was reduced to a joke quite frankly with none of his anger just stupid glasses. Most of the characters didn't get a look an and the first half of the film was just annoying. When the final fight does happen it is so unrealistic, with characters having bonding sessions as aliens and superheros were fighting all around them. Captain Marvel was in the film for about 10 seconds and destroyed the aliens so easily she made the rest of the characters redundant.\nIf the Russo Brothers had spent less time trying to get their friends and family cameo roles and more time trying to make the film we deserved it would have been a good thing. I am so disappointed in this movie it has left me heartbroken at the untimely end to what was one of my favorite film series ever.\nIt is a mess, the time travel was nonsensical, action was limited and the trademark humor was missing.\nI have no idea what the writers and directors were thinking.\nOh and Iron Man dies",

It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages.",

    "reviewBody": "I love science fiction and fantasy, and I have no problem suspending disbelief for purposes of enjoying a good comic book movie, but Endgame just didn't work for me on a couple levels. First, they kill Thanos with little fanfare or drama at what is basically the start of the show. This gets to the whole drama thing, it is all based essentially on a do over, but they try to make it dramatic because they just have \"one chance to get it right\" yet Cap and Tony screw up and just get a do over. So they are fighting to save the world (or half of it anyway) very dramatic, but if this doesn't work they will just do it over, not very dramatic, they beat Thanos at the beginning, again not very dramatic to fight him again.Then there is the time travel logic they use to build up the story that doesn't really work either, you can't change the past, you can just create alternative timelines, but the whole stone thing somehow sidesteps this critical rule \"as long as they put them back in time. And speaking of putting them back, getting them was a major deal involving the whole squad and a lot of risk. How is returning them so much easier? Black Widow \"has to stay dead\" yet Gamora, who died under the exact same circumstances/edict comes back no problem. Fat Thor and smart Hulk didn't help matters. Missed Vision too, everybody else could come back, but not the Viz? Screw that, he is the most interesting character on the whole team.Sorry, don't get all the love, worst Avengers movie yet by far.",

    "reviewTitle": "Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.",
    "reviewBody": "Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, \"The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.\" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",

    "reviewTitle": "Beautiful film",
    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

    "reviewTitle": "why such a low rating???",
    "reviewBody": "What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that \"if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death.\" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yet touching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding.",

    "reviewTitle": "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never truly know what you're gonna get. Forrest Gump is amazing!",
    "reviewBody": "Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet.",

    "reviewTitle": "An Amazing Movie",
    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1994. When it was released on VHS I obtained that version. I've watched the movie about once every two years since then. This is an amazing movie in any number of ways. One big way it amazes me, is the way which it, as a simple and guileless little story, like a feather wafting in the breeze, nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred and eyeball-bulging, forehead vein-popping, spittle-spewing vitriol from liberals and so-called \"intellectuals\" who are absolutely certain that, like a guided missile, it is seeking them out, intentionally, personally, to insult them with rightwing thoughts and ideas, and by a nitwit character no less. Hahahaha. As if.So let's first thing pop that little pea right out of the shooter. Let's dispense with the bilge of this movie being some kind of sub rosa rightwing plot. Puh-leeeze. This is a mainstream Hollywood production. Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, and Robin Wright Penn are all known Hollywood lefties, liberal devotees who would take the pipe long before allowing themselves to be associated with or be used by anything akin a rightwing movie, let alone be openly and voluntarily involved in making one. Bottom line, this is not a political movie. This is not a movie which is making any kind of political or social statements in any respect. People who think it is doing any of that are just working way too hard over-thinking it all. Period. It's odd because it's really not all that complicated of a thing to understand. Which leads directly to another amazing thing about this movie: it is amazing the way the simple little message the movie is actually sending just sails right over so many people's heads. Amazingly they just don't get it, and based on the comments here they still aren't getting it 14 years later and counting. So if you fall into that category let me help you out.What is the message of Forrest Gump? Stripped to its purest essence, this movie is about loyalty and devotion, particularly to the ones in our lives we love and care about. These are the human values being reinforced. Loyalty. Devotion. Forrest Gump embodies loyalty and devotion. To his mama. To his good best buddy Bubba. To the love of his life, Jenny. To his leader, Lt. Dan. And in the end to Forrest Jr. One by one and all together Forrest sticks by and takes care of his family, friends, and loved ones. This is the thread running through the entire story. This is what carries Forrest to all of the remarkable places he goes along the way.The use of a mentally challenged man as the leading man is a conceit, used to illustrate the point that loyalty and devotion are the most important things in life, trumping everything else. It drives home the point that nothing else really matters anywhere near as much. Indeed, it drives it home with blunt force. Maybe it drives it home too hard for such a simple little point. Maybe this is where the movie's detractors get themselves side-tracked. There are a number of other amazing and remarkable things about this movie. The performances. The special effects. The almost poetic simplicity of the story and the way it is told. See it for all this and more, but please, don't over-think it.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"I just felt like running\".",
    "reviewBody": "For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, \"Forrest Gump\" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.I got a kick out of Forrest's string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught Elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to LBJ's inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired John Lennon to write 'Imagine'. There was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets President Nixon, then inadvertently tips off the Watergate scandal. However the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film \"Midnight Cowboy\", when Forrest wheels Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. Lt. Dan's response was \"Hey, I'm walkin' here\", just the way Ratso Rizzo did in that earlier film. All that with the 'Everybody Talking at Me' movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story.For Forrest Gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. Not to mention finding one's own true love. For Forrest, life long friend Jenny (Robin Wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. For her part, Jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. It's fitting that Jenny eventually realizes what Forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise.I've seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for it's entertainment value. I guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. My viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of Forrest Gump in all of us.",

    "reviewTitle": "Forrest Gump (Negative Reviewers are Missing the Point)",
    "reviewBody": "I am a long time IMDb fan and first time reviewer. When I am reading through fellow user reviews, I generally find myself gravitating towards reading reviews that hold the opposite of my opinion. If I loved a film, I read the poor reviews and vice versa on the films that didn't resonate with me. I like finding value in an opposite viewpoint.With that said, while I read through the negative reviews of Forrest Gump, I found myself thinking that a number of the reviewers might be missing what I see is a large part of the film's message.Their focus was on the characters' intelligence and lifestyle. I read things like the point of the film was that you would be successful even if you're an idiot like Forrest, as long as you walked a conservative path. If you decided to take the path Jenny's character chose, despite the fact she was more intelligent than Forest, your life would end in disaster.I think the differences between Forrest and Jenny's journeys has nothing to do with the disparity in their intelligence or lifestyle but more with the difference between someone who knows who he truly is versus someone who is searching to find out who they are.I don't think the movie is passing judgement on either person's choices. I don't see Jenny's life ending the way it does as being a failure. Her life had value and she was able to find what she was looking for. Forrest's life was incredible and his love for Jenny was his guiding star. He lived through so many experiences and met so many famous people of that era. He lucked into wealth and at a couple points in the film became famous in his own right. None of that had any real meaning to him. His purpose came from his personal relationships, protecting and doing right by those he loved and his strong sense of right and wrong.Each character's journey (again regardless of intelligence) is representative of the experiences of an entire generation of North Americans.",

    "reviewTitle": "Timeless masterpiece, very unique",
    "reviewBody": "20 years after \"Forrest Gump\" came out, I decided to rewatch this one and it was even better than what I remembered from watching it the first time. The film won 6 Academy awards in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis, \"Back to the Future\"-trilogy, \"Cast Away\" again with Hanks later on) and Best Actor (2nd win in a row for Hanks after \"Philadelphia\"). And even if it lost \"Best Score\" to \"The Lion King\", the music, especially the main theme, is nothing short of brilliant. It starts right away as we watch a feather fly towards the film's central character. Visually and acoustically a feast from minute one.Forrest sits on a bench waiting for the bus and tells his story to the other people who are waiting. Thank God he did not know that he could just walk to Jenny, otherwise we may have never found out about his stories. And as diverse as Forrest's life is, as diverse are also the reactions from those people. Some sit quietly, others accuse him of being a liar and the old lady finally is captivated by his story. The interesting thing is that Gump gets out the photo as evidence not before the man (who accuses him of lying) leaves. He could have proved it easily, but he has nothing to prove to anybody. This is the frame of the story. The real action takes place in the stories Gump tells. Some true emotional highlights are included: Bubba's death and the funeral eulogy to Jenny (great HI. reference by the way) at the end. Of course, all the moments with his son (played by the very young Haley Joel Osment) are very much worth watching too. And then there is Gary Sinise who was pretty much on par with Hanks during their comedic and dramatic moments together. He did not win the Oscar, but was at least as deserving as Landau and Jackson. With his character, early on, you could never say if he would develop into a friend to Gump or stay/become a big antagonist. Finally, it turned out to be the former. When they have prostitutes one night at their place, it becomes truly clear for the very first time. Gump serves as a great role model to Sinise's character for all he achieved despite his limitations.This is not the greatest movie ever made, but there is a certain charm to it that makes it so unique in movie history, possibly because the central character is at least as unique. And finally, there is the Forrest-Jenny love story which is sweet from start to finish and one of the main reasons why this film will make you laugh, will make you cry and will make you feel for Forrest for its almost 2.5 hours . And even in the almost impossible case that you will not remain interested in Forrest's story, this film is very much worth watching alone for all the references to past decades (most of all in terms of the movements in society, music and politics). \"Forrest Gump\" is a must-watch and that's all I have to say about that.",

    "reviewTitle": "Forrest Gump",
    "reviewBody": "From Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated director Robert Zemeckis (The Back to the Future Trilogy), this is a remarkable comedy drama based on the novel by Winston Groom. Basically, Forrest Gump (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tom Hanks) is the low-intelligence but friendly man on a bus stop bench, and telling his life story to all strangers who sit down. The film is basically chronicles of his life accidentally ending up in big events of America between the 1950's and the 1970's, and finding fame and fortune without wanting or asking for it. These include meeting Elvis Presley, being put on an American football team for his running speed, meeting President John F. Kennedy, joining the army for the Vietnam war, becoming a Ping Pong champion, receiving the congressional medal of honour from President Richard Nixon, becoming a shrimp boat captain with his own company and running across America for two years. Within these adventures in his life, he always thinks of those close to him, the love of his life Jenny Curran (Golden Globe nominated Robin Wright Penn), friend Lt. Dan Taylor (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gary Sinise), friend Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and his mother Mrs. Gump (BAFTA nominated Sally Field), and with his low-intelligence he does not realise the significance of his actions. Also starring Siobhan Fallon as Dorothy Harris, School Bus Driver, Alexander Zemeckis (Robert's son) as School Bus Boy, Elizabeth Hanks (Tom's daughter) as School Bus Girl and The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump Jr. This is one of those films you cannot ignore, even if some people think not to watch it, but like Forrest says \"I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both\" (this explains the use of the feather at the beginning and end). Personally, this is a film I would definitely recommend to see, and not just because of Hanks in what has to be one of his best roles. It won the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for Alan Silvestri (he should have) and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (\"Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\"), it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Forrest at Jenny's grave, it was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very, very good!",

    "reviewTitle": "A reasonably enjoyable romp through recent history and pop culture  any more than that and it's a crass conservative message (spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "Sitting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump starts to take to those around him and tells a story of his life to date.  His is a fairly unremarkable life that spans recent history.  It begins with his childhood in Alabama and his growth from humble beginnings to take part in many memorable events in recent American history.I saw this when it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I haven't reviewed it until now because I've always felt that my views of this film were pushed one way or another by a) it winning lots of Oscars and b) everyone hammering it in comparison to Pulp Fiction.  It should be judged on it's own merits, so I watched it yesterday in an attempt to do that.  I felt that I could view it in one of two ways  either as a comical walk through recent history or as a message.As a special effects driven walk through recent history it is actually quite enjoyable.  It does get a bit tiresome to see Forrest meet one president after another, or invent popular songs/slogans/tee shirts/ bumper stickers etc but it still works quite well.  The subplot of his love for Jenny doesn't work as well in this context and actually serves only to slow things down a little and to create the cheesy climax to the film.  However this subplot is the basis for the film's `message'.  Jenny and Forrest both start out in the same place.  Forrest works hard without questioning anything, sure he gets some tough breaks but his dogged efforts eventually work out for him.  Jenny, on the other hand, gets involved in the other culture of the times  be it political rebellion, drugs, music, extramarital sex etc. Her fate is less than Forrest's  she dies and realises on her death dead that she should have just been clean cut like Forrest.  This side of the film smacks rather heavily  first of all it is all too sentimental but, more importantly, it is a clear attack on the counter cultures and a condemnation of those that are part of them.Of course the film's humour means that the two extremes of Forrest and Jenny are also played for laughs so even a flag burning, drug user may be won over by the film before it starts to deliver it's message drop and drop.  I tried just to enjoy the comic side of the film but it wasn't enough to fill the 2 hour plus run time and I started looking at the sub plot  and didn't like what I saw.The cast are all pretty OK.  I don't think for a moment that Hanks deserved his Oscar, but there's nothing more can be said of that.  He does do good work to play his `dumb' character so well but it shouldn't really have won no matter who else it was up against.  Penn is OK but only has to play `bad' for most of the film.  Sinise is pretty good value and his character is a mix, with the bitterness writ large on his life.  Williamson plays another `dumb' character but does OK and Field is alright as Forrest's Mom.  To be honest the cast all match the tone of the film  all good people who just keep plodding along and get good results.Overall I should take the film to be praise of an America where even those with 75 IQ's can make it, however this simply isn't true.  What remains once this is rejected is the comedy of seeing Hanks inserted into archive footage (to mostly amusing effect) and a crass and obvious attack on those who would go against whatever America stands for.  It's worth a watch but the crude message and effect driven humour simply didn't help me understand where all those Oscars came from.",

    "reviewBody": "Everyone loves this movie... except me.\nSomehow I find the contrast between the unsophisticated, often rather juvenile, style of humour, which is juxtaposed with issues like physical handicap, child molestation, mutilation from war, death from war and cancer, jarring and uncomfortable.\nFor me I would consider the type of broad acting in this film was fine if it were a pure comedy, such as \"Ground Hog Day\", but in this context, where serious issues are supposedly being addressed, it lacks the necessary degree of subtlety (or respect).\nTom Hanks performance is wonderful, but still essentially cartoonish, like Gomer Pyle. I don't at any time buy into his portrayal as a credible mentally challenged person. (As, for example, I was able to do with Dustin Hoffman in Rain-man)\nI guess the Director's concept was for us to view the events from what is intended to be Forrest's limited perspective, but for me it doesn't work.\nIt's told as a fairy-tale, but personally I'm just not comfortable with many of these topics being dealt with in such a shallow fashion. Hitchcock knew how to mix humour with suspense, but it's not an easy trick to pull off, this film tries to mix tragedy with comedy and I find it an unpleasant mixture.\nIn the world where little girls are sexually molested by their fathers and young men have their legs amputated after being caught by an exploding shells, crippled kids don't become All American running backs (although they may become gold medal blade runners at the Paralympics!) and intellectually handicapped people don't become Shrimp magnates.\nDon't get me wrong, I've nothing against a good fairy-tale, but I suspect this movie aspires to be allegorical and profound as well, which it is not.\nThe movie packs in so many traumatic situations that it fails to do any of them justice, and then casually throws historical ones in on top\nThe assassination of the Kennedys and John Lennon, along with attempts on George Wallis and Gerald Ford are mentioned, although Forrest is not present for any of them and doesn't strike me as a person who has any political awareness or would take notice of current events.\n(However Martin Luthor King and Malcolm X are spared inclusion.)\nThe frequent use of familiar pop music from the period is another cheap trick to engage the emotions of the audience without doing the work. Much of the music has little or no connection to the story and even less to the character of Forrest, who has no interest, understanding, or emotional connection with the pop culture of the day.\nForrest is strangely detached from the World around him, and probably that's the intention?\nBut in that case what relevance or insight can his character have to the events through which he wanders?\nI'm sure this story is intended to be very deep and meaningful, but really, Forrest Gump could as easily have been set in the 1920s, 30s or 40s for all the relevance or insight he brings to 50s, 60s, 70s culture.\nThe part of the movie where Forrest runs across country invites comparison to Peter Sellars character in \"Being There\", a holy fool, but FG lacks the depth of that movie, and in any case only has five minutes to spare on this topic before moving on again.\nThere is some tenuous and weak humour involving \"Sh*t Happens\" and smiley face tee shirts, but no actual words of ambiguous wisdom that might account for his following.\nThe film continues to throw issues and situations at us, like so many custard pies, hoping some will stick, but most end up being only half baked. (How do you like them mixed metaphors!)\nThe Apple shares bit is pure product placement, Forrest was already as rich as they want to make him via the Shrimp company.\nAnd why would anyone offer the multimillion dollar owner of a Shrimp company a job mowing lawns?\nThen we get not one, but two, tragic deaths by disease to weep about, first Mom from the big \"C\" and then \"me own me sporting Jenny\" from a cause never made clear.\nJenny only brings Forrest back into her life because she is dying, not because she loves him enough to want to share her life and their child with him. How is that inspirational?\nGood things come to those who wait? The meek shall inherit the earth? \nThe secret to true happiness is low expectations?\nLife is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get (chocolate maybe?)\nChocolate Happens.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simple, basic, and true",
    "reviewBody": "I just recently saw this movie again, hadn't seen it since it first came out in '94.  Maybe everyone else figured it out, but I suddenly realized  that the whole movie really was about \"stupid is as stupid does,\" the phrase he repeats every time he's accused of being dim.  Forrest Gump is obviously not a bright guy, but the movie seems to say that that doesn't matter very much because he makes the right choices.  His decisions are smart even if he isn't.  And his decisions are, of course, strangely conservative, strange insofar as the movie comes out of ultraliberal Hollywood.  He plays sports, has an old fashioned sense of chivalry (i.e. beating up anyone who abuses his lifelong love Jenny), he goes to war, he believes in God, starts up a small business, works hard, loves his mother, has a deep sense of honor (giving over half the proceeds of \"Bubba Gump\" to the family of his deceased friend) and, strangest of all, is a white male from the south portrayed in a positive light.  Contrapose this with Jenny, who is obviously very bright, very smart and makes every wrong move one could make (\"stupid is as stupid does\" again comes to mind).  She's promiscuous, a drug user, suicidal, falls in with the anti-war inanity of the SDS and Black Panthers, parties hard at discos during the seventies, and ultimately ends up dying of AIDS, never mentioned, but the implication is of course there.  The movie is a tour through American history of course, but I don't think the special effects detract from the basic simplicity of the story.  It is basically a morality story.  Not a very deep or complex one, but just very simple--do the right things, and your life will turn out okay. \nThere aren't very many of these movies made anymore, and so it's somewhat satisfying that this one was, and that it was so successful. It's as if American society had finally had its fill of beautiful alienated youngsters who rebel, do drugs, hate their parents and act like all around jerks (see American Beauty or Cruel Intentions for examples).  Gump isn't the best movie ever made, but it's a strong one, one very much worth seeing, and seeing again to be honest.  \"Stupid is as stupid does\" may not be poetry or very deep, but it ends up being true, and more than enough to fill up a movie, and make you feel good as the feather floats up into the air at the end.",

    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump (1994): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson: Brilliant filmmaking that stretches many historical aspects all observed and experienced by one simple individual who lived a complicated life. Forrest Gump was born and raised in Alabama where he overcomes a walking disability, survives Vietnam, starts a shrimp business, plays football, and meets two Presidents. What is most interesting is its emphasis upon the historical elements through the limited understanding of Gump. Excellent work by director Robert Zemeckis whose impressive resume also includes such unique films as Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Remarkable work by Tom Hanks as Gump whose accomplishments never out weight his sense of devotion. Robin Wright plays Jenny who descends into drugs all the while denying the one man who has always sheltered her. Mykelti Williamson plays Vietnan buddy Bubba whose friendship with Gump would live on when a dream becomes a reality. Gary Sinise is commanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor whose sense of duty is tested when Gump saves him thus opening other opportunities. Sally Field plays Gump's caring mother whose advice is carried on through memory. Sometimes unfairly depressing but demonstrates one's purpose to do great things. Score: 9 / 10",

    "reviewTitle": "Over-rated and disappointing!",
    "reviewBody": "\"Spoilers\" I must start by writing that I do not like this movie at all. Even though it began well I thought it became dull quite quickly because of the many uninteresting and pointless turns in the plot.We see Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting on a bench talking to a person who sits next to him about his life. When Forrest was young he had a lot of problems because he was a handicapped person. He meets a pretty girl on the school bus and begins to fall in love with her. When some envious and mean school children are chasing him he discovers he can run, finally overcoming his physical disability. This scene was amazing because it shows that people can overcome any diseases by having faith in themselves. Forrest Gump was a brave boy who tried to run, even when it was nearly impossible for him. That was an interesting beginning. However, when he grows up and graduates from college this movie turns out to be awful, as the only thing he does is keep talking about his life as a football player, as a runner and, ridiculously as a soldier, he's inexplicably the best soldier.  Forrest Gump seems to believe he's very interesting, that his achievements in life are extremely important and valuable to us, but they aren't. For instance, we see him getting medals and many other things, but I really didn't feel interested in what he received because he seems to be so arrogant, thinking he's the best person in the world. I didn't find myself quite absorbed in the film because I didn't feel amazed by all the achievements he got. Why does he tell it? He only tells people about his achievements to show off, pretending he's a great person! He is happily and arrogantly seated on a bench telling his life to whoever sits next to him. I didn't care what he said, because he only driveled.After the disappointing climax comes the original ending, which I enjoyed because it wasn't predictable. I never thought Forrest's wife would die. She was sick but I didn't like the way she died. It seems that the writers didn't have anything interesting to add, other than a simple disease to get her out of the story. I also liked it when Forrest and his wife had a child whom they also named Forrest, but I thought the final scene where the child gets onto a bus is interesting because it's somewhat unpredictable; it looked like the whole story would begin again and I do not want to see the same insipid story again because I already went through Gump's life. I certainly do not want to go through his son's life. That'd be more grief!I do not understand why it received an academy award for best picture. I haven't seen many of 1994's movies, but I'm sure there are more inspiring and interesting movies than this one. A good example would be `Shawshank Redempion' that unbelievably lost the Oscar for best picture!Overall, this movie is not outstanding. There are many unnecessary and long scenes such as his life in the army, his life as a rich person his life as a person who waits for a bus and finally his life as a runner. I'm sure this could have been a shorter movie. If it had been this way it wouldn't be so annoying. I found the movie far-fetched because I don't think people can run as much as he did, and I don't think people can be so successful without working hard for their future. When do we see Forrest willing to be a successful person? He only did what his family and girlfriend told him to do. He was never willing to be a successful person. I know it's just a movie so I don't worry about it. All the performances in this movie were somewhat believable, especially Sally Field who was an excellent loving mother. I felt sad when she died, since her character was very caring to her son, as some mothers are to their children. Sally Field's performance was convincing, but I didn't find Tom Hanks deserving of an academy award, because he gave an unbelievably simple and unchallenging performance. His performance in 'The Green Mile' was better. 5/10",

    "reviewBody": "This movie suffers from a bad case of \"schizophrenia\". The movie starts out as a story about a boy who overcomes a handicap with a strong single mother (played by Sally Field). The movie could have been then a \"low key\" version of Radio and made a statement about the obstacles one has to overcome. Instead, Zemeckis wanted to make a statement about American history from the 60s to the 80s. The result was a judgmental indictment without regard for the \"complexities\" involved. For example, we are supposed to think that Forrest Gump is so \"dimwitted\" that he doesn't care about civil rights, when a young black woman is trying to attend class. Is Zemeckis mocking civil rights? Then there is something about having to pee while shaking hands with LBJ. I guess some people find this funny, but it just appeared childish to me. Then, Gump goes off to Vietnam, leaving his \"flaky\", \"irresponsible\" girlfriend behind. You get tired easily of his girlfriend being portrayed as an irresponsible child. When he returns from 'Nam, he gets in a fight with some pretentious hippy, who is supposed to represent the entire anti-War movement. This really irritated me seeing all the complex issues of the 60s being used to subjectively attack the anti-war movement. After this slight, the movie moves on to a new story. Now Forrest is running for no reason. In the movie \"Convoy\", where this idea was borrowed from (switching from truckers to runners), there seemed to be a little bit of a political message. Forrest is just running for no rhyme or reason. By the end of the movie, I am just annoyed by his talk about a box of chocolate. This movie was extremely annoying, patronizing, and ignorant. Forrest Gump might of been a better, more honest movie, if Zemeckis stuck to the storyline, instead of pursuing a right-wing political agenda.",

    "reviewTitle": "puzzled by its popularity",
    "reviewBody": "Maybe the book was better.I get that they were going for a \"stupid is as stupid does\", to show the triumph of optimism, et al.But mostly this movie just made me sad. Sad that Forrest was treated this way. Sad that even his triumphs were accidental.The fact that they had Forrest get to meet Elvis, the president(s), John Lennon and all those other historical figures just made it seem even more fake than the CGI it took to add him to all those historical scenes (George Wallace, JFK, Johnson, etc.) It threw you out of the realism of the film -- AND also seemed so unrealistic that someone like Forrest could achieve those kinds of things outside of a film.Finally, I don't understand anyone considering his love of Jenny as a true romance. Yes, I believe he loved her. I believe that she loved him in her own way, but not romantically. I understand that she was incredibly messed up by the sexual abuse of her father and that's why she pursued the self-destructive life she did. I understand that she felt she might not be worthy of Forrest because she was suicidal and messed up. She seems to have tried to turn her life around right before she died of AIDS, and was trying to provide for herself without relying on a man.My interpretation of Jenny relationship with Forrest was either: 1. She came home because she was pregnant (cue her sleeping all the time), then had sex with Forrest, then years later when sick, claimed he was the father, so her son would be taken care of. or 2. Forrest truly was the father (and there are hints such as them bending their heads the same way while watching TV & fishing). If so, why did she not tell Forrest he had a child until she was dying? I understand maybe she didn't want to marry him and raise the child together - but that still seemed cruel. Again, I feel that she only married him at the end as she was dying to give the child a parent. Not because she felt true romantic love for Forrest.Best part of the film were the performances. I did like Gary Sinese's performance, that was outstanding. His bitterness at being rescued, his life trajectory and turn around were handled very well. Tom Hanks did a good job of portraying Forrest with dignity. And Robin Wright did a fairly good job as a self-destructive victim struggling to come to terms with her life.",

Of course Gump is a \"simpleton\"; any complex opinions might likewise bring out similar thoughts in the audience, and we can't have that is a big shiny Hollywood movie. (Yeah, Gump tried to speak out in DC, but the microphone went screwy...silenced by THE MAN! :) )  And what's with the ending? Let's see, AIDS, death, marriage, another death - all in twenty minutes.  Jeez, it's shameless.\nNO WAY this is better than Shawshank! Morgan Freeman's performance both breaks my heart and fills me with hope (pretty much what Hanks tried and failed to do - and he won the friggin' Oscar).  And Pulp Fiction changed audience's and Hollywood's perception of what a film can be, something that Gump didn't even attempt. It sucks. IT SUCKS. Still, always great to see Sally Field...",

    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump is the story of a guy with a low IQ and his journey through life, encompassing the homespun apple pie America of the 50s when everything was rosy and American interventionism led the world against the evil Communists, the horrible 60s when those nasty dirty hippies tried to usurp American Interventionism and God-given right to invade other people by protesting against the Vietnam War. (Shock, horror, Nixon was right all along!) and the crisis-torn 70s, when all those nasty hippies were now drug-addicted Aids carriers that caused American Interventionism and God-given etc, etc.You get the point. The issues raised in the movie were far more complex than the mindset on display here, with good and bad on both sides of the argument. America is a wonderful country with wonderful people, but it can't feel good about itself so the film-makers just rewrite history so it CAN feel good about itself. It takes more than a movie of course but apparently people want to be convinced that Interventionism is not such a bad idea; still working well, isn't it? Gump's a decent guy, of course. He isn't judgemental for one thing. Perhaps if we were all afflicted with similar IQs no one would question anything, and American Interventionsm etc etc....I liked Gary Sinise's performance as the war veteran amputee, just another decent guy who has every reason to feel bitter. Pity the movie then has his character rounding on the left-wing draft dodgers and hippie protesters who didn't go to Vietnam, but tried to stop the conflict; perhaps he would better off rounding on the people who sent him there in the first place???This is a great movie for reactionaries. \"God damn it, I told ya that was the way it was!\" Bet they all give it a 10.",

The story is a lesson of life, showing the simple and mentally challenged Forrest in an epic journey through life, meeting historical figures like Elvis,John F. Kennedy,Richard Nixon, Jonh Lennon, among many others and experiencing first-hand historic events, while largely unaware of their significance, due to his low IQ of 75.Even misunderstood by many people and considered to be ''stupid'' by them, Forrest has more success in his life then many of his ''normal'' friends, receiving many honor medals, becoming rich and inspiring many people. The movie is a lesson of life and shows how people who are discriminated can have more success then many of the ordinary ones.And Lt. Dan Taylor, shows how people's minds can change through the years, when he first wants to die in the camp with his soldiers, and years later, thanks Forrest, that saved his life from the death.I think everybody should watch this awesome movie at least once in a lifetime.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Brilliant Comedy of Epic Proportions",
    "reviewBody": "\"Back to the Future\" trilogy director Robert Zemeckis surpassed himself in ways that he probably never imagined when he made \"Forrest Gump.\" Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes, this PG-13 rated comedy about the epic misadventures of a slow-witted dolt from rural Alabama with a below-average I.Q. who lives through several milestone events in the 1960s received the Oscar for Best Picture of 1994. Not only did Zemeckis earn a Best Director Oscar, but also Tom Hanks' took home the Academy statuette for Best Actor with his insightful, down-to-earth thesping. Forrest Gump is not the brightest bulb in the grid, but Hanks conveys this quality without ever stooping to histrionics. Above all, Hanks delivers a performance that has innocence and dignity intertwined. Moreover, \"Forrest Gump\" qualifies as Hanks' best film.\"Forrest Gump\" unfolds in Savannah, Georgia, as the eponymous character narrates the story of his life in a number of flashbacks. Indeed, two-thirds of the action takes place with Forrest on the bench relating his exploits to other people waiting for their bus. The first time that we see young Forrest, he has just been fitted with a pair of leg braces at the doctor's office while his mother (Sally Fields of \"Norma Ray\") watches. She is determined to see to it that father-less Forrest gets to live as normal a life as possible. The school principal (Sam Anderson of \"La Bamba\") fails to convince her that Forrest's low I.Q. of 75 means that he should not attend regular school classes. Despite Forrest's intellectual's shortcomings, Mrs. Gump persuades the principal to permit Forrest to enroll in normal classes by having loud, noisy sex with him. The next time that we see young Forrest (newcomer Michael Humphreys) he hesitates about climbing aboard the school bus because he doesn't know the bus driver and has been warned by his mother not to accept rides from strangers. The driver and Forrest introduce themselves to each other and he steps aboard because they are now no longer strangers. Forrest meets his first best friend Jenny Curran when she is the only student riding the bus who will let him sit beside her. Later, Forrest meets his second best friend on his way to military boot camp when Bubba makes room for him to sit beside him after others have turned him away.Jenny and Forrest cultivate their friendship to the point that other students decide to attack Forrest. Initially, these obnoxious kids throw rocks at Forrest while he is walking home with Jenny. \"Run, Forrest, run,\" screams Jenny to our hero as the kids hurl more rocks and pursue him on their bicycles. Forrest takes off running and his braces disintegrate and he breaks into a loping stride that the kids on their bikes cannot match. The first chronological transition from young Forrest to Tom Hanks as Forrest occurs when the same kids—only older—attack Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright of \"The Princess Bride\") and try to run him down in their pick-up truck. Again, Forrest outruns them and scrambles through a practice scrimmage that Alabama football coach Bear Bryant (Sonny Shroyer of \"Gator\") is holding. Forrest winds up in college, joins the football and scores touchdowns for the Alabama Crimson Tide. During his stay at Alabama, Forrest is exposed to the famous stance in the doorway by real-life Alabama governor George Wallace when the University of Alabama was integrated by African-American students. As one of the black students is entering the school, she drops a book and Forrest retrieves it on camera. Later, Forrest visits the White House, drinks 15 Dr. Pepper sodas, and gets to shake hands with the real President John F. Kennedy.Meanwhile, Jenny has grown up, left her abusive father to live with another person, and ends up in an all-girls' school. Forrest shows up and beats up Jenny's date because he thinks that the guy is getting rough with her. Jenny gives Forrest his first sexual experience. She cups his hand over her breast and he blows a gasket while Jenny's roommate—apparently asleep—listens in horror as Forrest admits that he has messed up the roommate's bathrobe. Jenny informs Forrest that she wants to become a folk singer like her idol Joan Baez. Forrest joins the U.S. Army and takes a furlough to Memphis, Tennessee, to see Jenny perform folk songs on stage. Forrest knows that Jenny got expelled from her college for posing nude in a 'Girls of the South' issue of Playboy magazine, but he isn't prepared for what he sees when she performs in the nude singing a Bob Dylan song. When a spectator heckles Jenny, Forrest comes to her rescue.Significantly, the film pioneered some revolutionary techniques, such as inserting a live actor into historic archival footage of important events as well as enabling Oscar nominated actor Gary Sinise to appear convincing as a handicapped Vietnam veteran who has lost both legs in combat. If the structure of \"Forrest Gump\" is reminiscent of David Fincher's recent opus \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" this is no surprise because Eric Roth penned scripts for both \"Forrest Gump\" as well as \"Benjamin Button.\" Roth got an Oscar for his adaptation of Winston Groom's novel. Not surprisingly, \"Forrest Gump\" was awarded Oscars for best visual effects. Interestingly, Paramount Pictures produced this film for $55-million dollars and coined over $600 million dollars from it domestically as well as internationally.",

Given the tone of the movie I doubt that this was meant as a sarcastic comment on the intelligence of college football players, but that is how I saw it. It's an insult to real players who have worked hard to get on a team.All right, so I should just view this as some feel-good fantasy, yes? But there were some scenes that were played for real: Gump's buddy in the Vietnam war being fatally shot in the guts, his girl friend dying of AIDS, his mother dying of cancer. Such mixtures of realism and fantasy have never worked for me.Putting the above matters aside, there are more serious concerns. The message of this movie, that being mentally challenged is only a minor impediment to achieving great successes in life, is objectionable. How are parents dealing with the real problems that mentally challenged children have in this world supposed to react to this message? Or the mentally challenged themselves? Or everybody else for that matter.I was highly offended by this movie.",

    "reviewBody": "There are movies and movies & there is Forrest Gump.Movies that make you laugh, movies that make you ponder,movies that may excite you, but only a few can make you cry. Forrest Gump does it all. Boy, tears rolled down for the first time after watching a movie(of course there are other movies that followed but surely none of those were even close to this phenomenal motion picture). Not that I am Hercules or Thor, but it takes immense poignance to make me cry. Talking about Robert Zemeckis, the man always had a peculiarity in his direction but this is the one which stands tall among all. This story wouldn't have been the same without him. He is the one who brought the feel to this movie. Tom Hanks does not have Tom Cruise's face or Brad Pitt's body & so he got to the best with what God has given him- SHEER ACTING PROWESS. In early 90's he was still to establish himself among great names & thats how he did it? Although he had already won an Oscar for philadelphia but this movie was his official entry to the hearts of millions of people across the globe. Its hard to imagine any other actor fit in this role. His movies have always been like a box of chocolates- YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME & this one is a pure delight- a movie that can make your day.Some of the finest dialogs, thrilling moments, funny instances, touching storyline, insightful thoughts & a pinch of romance, this movie offers you everything you are looking in a heartwarming feel-good movie.Robin Wright's performance was a treat to watch and some breathtaking chemistry with Tom Hanks made it even more delicious. Even the best in the romance cannot match this one. \"I may not be a smart man but I know what love is\" is one of my favorite lines in the movie. Stupidity has never been so touchy before.Every single character contributed to this beautiful fable in bits & pieces- Forrest, Jenny, Lt. Dan, Bubba, Forrest's Mama, Young Forrest & Junior Forrest are some of the unforgettable ones. An extraordinary journey of an ordinary man & arguably one of the best performances of all time by Tom Hanks- don't give a miss to this one. It may change your perception about life.One hell of a movie & it will be close to my heart forever! what can I say more",

    "reviewBody": "I hated this movie. When it came out and I actually went around saying that people thought I was odd or maybe alien to this planet. But I thought it was the most manipulative, unrealistic, piece of tripe I ever saw. Nothing that happens to Forrest would happen in reality and don't tell me it's a parable, because I don't even think it works on that level. The truth is if I was sitting on a bench with Forrest and he started to tell me his life story, I would get up and leave because strangers who behave that way make me uncomfortable and many people would admit this if they were honest enough to get over the emotional aspects of the story. Jenny was a tramp who didn't love him and slept around and didn't deserve that slavish devotion. And the line \"Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get\" not only makes \"love means never having to say you're sorry\" look profound, but it's untrue to boot. Whitman samplers publish the contents on the inside of the box. So, shoot me. I thought this movie appealed to the worst sentimental instincts of the human race and I resented being asked to go along with it.",

    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump is a good-natured simpleton. His below-average IQ has restricted him (some might say protected him) from understanding the intricacies of the world he inhabits, and so he is oblivious to the hate and prejudice of American society.Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Back To The Future) and multiple academy-award winner Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan) present us with the world as seen through the eyes of Forrest Gump, in one of the most powerful stories ever committed to screen.Though he may not be the smartest person in the world, Forrest Gump has achieved some amazing things. Aside from meeting three different American presidents and becoming a world ping-pong champion, Forrest has also been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his courage during the Vietnam War, run across the country several times over (because he \"just felt like running\"), inspired Elvis Presley to invent a new type of dance and exposed the Watergate scandal. At the heart of the film is a love-story. Forrest and his life-long companion, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn- Hurlyburly, The Singing Detective), are two completely different people, and Jenny knows that he deserves better, but Forrest loves her anyway. \"I'm not a smart man,\" Forrest declares. \"But I know what love is.\"The acting in this film is nothing short of perfect. Tom Hanks demonstrates how he will win his second Best Actor Oscar with this performance. Nobody else could have possibly portrayed Forrest so perfectly. The supporting cast is strong. Robin Wright Penn is good, and Gary Sinise gives the best performance of his career as Lieutenant Dan Taylor.\"... Life is a box of chocolates,\" Forrest announces at the beginning of the film. \"You never know what you are going to get.\" This film is exactly that. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump, you will laugh, and you will cry. This life's journey is one that you will never forget.",

    "reviewBody": "The movie is a bit over-hyped. And I do think that Pulp Fiction should have gotten the Academy Award that year. But there are many times when I disagreed with the winner and this is the one time where I am not too upset because it is still a great movie.It shows us the history through the eyes of Forrest Hump. He has a low IQ and this makes them look at things with the eyes of an innocent and pure person.I disagree with the people who believe that the message of the movie is that one should never question authority. Forrest doesn't just follow. While he doesn't analyze his actions much, he usually does what he feels like. He does save Lt. Taylor even though he is telling him to leave him. He has a bunch of people following him on his run, which I think is another example where it shows that one should not just follow but try to understand why. And I never saw Jenny as a bad character. She was an abused person trying to find herself. Her death is not some kind of punishment for her actions and the fact that she was fighting for social changes. It is just a \"part of life\", and her life ends well because at the end of it she is finally at peace with herself. She lived a life that she wanted and at the end had a family and realized that Forrest is the one who loved her more than anyone even though she used to think that he doesn't know what love is.The acting is very good. I loved Robyn Wright as Jenny and Gary Sinise as Ltd. Taylor.I don't think it is a political propaganda of any kind. I don't know what the political beliefs of the director are, but I didn't feel it was pushing us in any way.The movie has many messages. One would be to take all of lives opportunities. That even when it seems like nothing good will happen it might. That one should fight for what one believes in. That one can find love in the most unusual places It is a very sweet movie. One shouldn't take it to seriously, analyze it on a political level or wait for it to be believable. It is very unique and interesting. A bit too long and too sweet maybe, it is still very good",

    "reviewBody": "One of Oscar's low moments had to be in awarding this picturebest film, best director, and best lead actor. The movie's nothingbut a pastiche of sentimentalism and forced nostalgia, strungtogether with soundbytes and pasted-in beautiful visuals, like aHallmark card glued onto celluloid.The whole schtick of having Forrest appear at \"key moments\" inthe 60s and 70s is just a sort of emotional rorshach blot on film,designed to allow the viewer to see whatever she or he wants.Even the soundtrack is a formulaic greatest hits soundtrack.Vietnam? Creedence! Drug scene in the early 70s? The Doors!Want to relive the running craze of the 70s? Jackson Browne's\"Running on Empty!\"  Yes, the movie is that achingly literal.I'm also stunned Hanks got best actor for this film. Hollywoodreally does love actors playing \"special\" people, doesn't it? (DustinHoffman in Rainman, Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, etc. )Hanks is a professional, to be sure, but given the plotless text andthe range of emotions in the character (the whole gamut fromscared and stupid to confused and stupid), it wasn't a whole lot towork with.In an allegedly enlightened era, too, there's a lot of humour in thismovie which is basically, \"look at how stupid this retarded guy is!he doesn't know his mother's whoring! he doesn't know a shrimpboat isn't a tiny little craft! he doesn't get ironic humour like we do!ha ha ha ha ha!\" Pair him up with another such person in theVietnam sequences, ha ha, it's so funny the two dummies don'tknow the other one is a dummy! So to compliment the trite,non-dramatic sentimentalism, we have sophomoric comedy at theexpense of the mentally retarded.The one curiousity is an early performance by Haley Joel Osmentas, of course, a preturnaturally loquacious but cute mop-toppedurchin (spoiler coming) named Forrest Gump Junior.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie had its humorous moments, but with that came way to many sappy scenes and suffice to say I did not love this movie. Nothing I hated, but nothing I try to watch when I see it on the television either. The story revolves around the character of the title Forrest Gump of course. It basically goes through different parts of his life and shows how a very simple man led a rather astonishing life. A rather unrealistic life filled with a bit to much melodrama for my tastes. I can see why others like this movie, but once again just not really my type of movie. Tom Hanks is good in the lead role and I also thought Gary Sinese was good in his role too, however I did not care for the character of Jenny as she just ticked me off to no end. The film is also better in some places than other as the film really has a rather disjointed feel to it. It goes from here to there and is not hard to follow at times though it just feels like a patchwork movie. The Vietnam portion of the film to me was the highlight, here the comedy was good and even the drama worked too. Other sections of the film at times just felt to underdeveloped. Here is Forrest entering college, now he is done two minutes later, here is Forrest playing ping pong, now he is back Washington D.C. at a black panther party. Like I said it has its moments, but for me it was a bit to all over the place like they tried to get everything that was in the book up on screen. And as short as some of this segments were you then have a rather lengthy scene of just him running, though that one was rather good even though it was simple. I will never see how this film beat out \"True Lies\" for the best special effects Oscar, I was not overly impressed with the scenes Forrest was inserted in as it simply looked like they animated the mouths of those he was supposed to be meeting and they sort of stuck him in there using file footage of John F. Kennedy for example. I just thought it was just a bit better technique used than that of a Steve Martin film \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\". Overall it was okay, but just not going to be in my personal top 100 movies of all time.",

    "reviewBody": "This is the 3rd best movie I've seen. I love everything about this movie. The acting, the story, and how almost every big news event from the 1950s to the 1980s finds it's way in this film. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a kid from Alabama with a low IQ of 75 and with braces on his legs. He meets a girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) and they become good friends. Forrest starts to lead an extremely productive life. Despite his low IQ he is accepted into the University of Alabama and becomes part of the all American team. While there he witnesses George Wallace stand in the door, to keep African American students out. When he graduates he joins the US Army and serves in the Vietnam War. He befriends a fellow boot camp recruit, Private Benjamin Buford \"Bubba\" Blue (Mykelti Williamson) who has a dream of going into the shrimping business and his platoon commander Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who regards it as his destiny to die in combat like his ancestors before him had all done. In one part the platoon is ambushed by the Viet Cong. All the men are wounded. Forrest takes all the wounded men and brings them to safety, including Lieutenant Dan. Bubba dies and Lieutenant Dan is angry with Forrest for not letting him die in combat. In the Army hospital Forrest takes a liking to Ping Pong and becomes the Ping Pong champion, and receives the Medal of Honor for saving everyone. In Washington DC he meets Jenny again who has lead a life that is the opposite of Forrest's. She moves from failure to failure as she becomes a hippie and takes drugs while Forrest goes to China to play Ping Pong for the US against the Chinese team. He meets Lieutenant Dan in New York, New York who has now fallen into depression and is still mad at Forrest for leaving him a cripple. Forrest retires from the Army and goes to become Captain of a shrimp boat like Bubba wanted to do. Lieutenant Dan later becomes his first-mate and they begin to own a very successful shrimping business. Forrest meets Jenny again and they spend more time together before she leaves again. Then Forrest for no reason at all decides to take a long run all over Alabama at first and then all over the country. He meets Jenny again who now has a son named Forrest Jr. (Haley Joel Osment) and shortly after wards Forrest and Jenny are married, and their wedding is attended by Lieutenant Dan. Later Jenny sadly dies. The film ends as Forrest is waiting for the school bus to come by and pick up Forrest Jr. on the same tree stump that Forrest's mother (Sally Field) had waited by on Forrest Sr.s first day of school. I highly consider this to be Tom Hanks's best role in any movie he's done. I certainly recommend this film to everyone.",

    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump is an instant classic. It is easily lovable and has a brilliant script, along with a career best performance from Tom Hanks, great acting by the rest of the cast, a wonderful story and great direction. The story itself is told in such a witty manner, keeping in mind that the narrator is Tom Hanks and as he is a bit low on I.Q, he does not take his life very seriously and merrily spends it. The movie is long but it never drags on. I thought that even if it extended for a few more minutes, I would not mind it.Tom Hanks gives a splendid performance and is one character that would be remembered. The emotions are expressed through his eyes. It is very hard not to shed a few tears or even keep your eyes dry when he cries or is sad, especially during the death of his closest. Jenny's character is absolutely the opposite as she develops all wrong habits and suffers throughout her life. Not a very likable character. The other actors too give very good performances, mainly Sally Field, Garry Sinise. Bubba is also humorous with his obsession with shrimps.Everything is good about this movie. The movie doesn't get boring at all. One of the best movies I have seen. 10 on 10 for this film, which is rare since I don't give such rating usually.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nostalgia and fairy tale",
    "reviewBody": "This film is admirable because of the actor who is playing the part of a \"dummy,\" an \"idiot,\" a \"mentally handicapped person.\" Tom Hanks is so natural in his acting that he really looks the part.Apart from that the film is the most typical American dream fairy tale you can imagine, though often going against politically correct ideas, like the mother (and there is no father) going into fornication with the principal of the school of the town in order to have her son registered in a \"normal\" school instead of a \"special\" school, though he is just a couple of points under the minimum IQ required. The miracle of his running performance is just what it is a fairy tale miracle that makes him, after having been a \"spastics\" child for years a champion runner one afternoon to escape bullies on bicycles and later on again the same bullies, but who care who they are, this time in an automobile vehicle, in fact a pick-up truck. Good boy indeed. He will become a football champion. He will go to college on a sports scholarship, will make a career there and get a degree. He will enlist in the army straight away and will go to Vietnam where he will, thanks to his limited intellect and his running capability, save four or five wounded GIs just before they are levelled into the soil by a friendly bombing of the area where they got wounded. He will get a congressional Medal of Honor for this fact. He will get wounded in the bottom and as such will be sent to a hospital where he will learn how to become the best ping-pong player ever, a skill that is just physical and in no way intellectual. After being discharged he will hold his promise to Baba, his best black friend in the army who unluckily got killed in Vietnam and he will start a shrimp fishing business with the money some ping pong racket producer paid him in order to use his name and picture to promote their products. His old lieutenant from Vietnam, whose life he saved on the day when he saved four or five GIs, one of them being his lieutenant, kept his word too and became his partner, though he was legless. A storm destroys the shrimp fishing industry in Alabama and Forrest Gump's ship is the only one to survive the storm. As such now, without any competition, he starts booming. His partner invests the money intelligently, in some apple business, and they both become millionaires. Forrest Gump can retire or so from active life since he gets a very wealthy and comfortable income that counts in millions every year.He can do what he wants and thus he runs around the USA, across and across again for more than three years when he is summoned by his old school girlfriend Jenny in some place somewhere in fairy land. He had had one and only sexual episode of intercourse some time before she left him again several years ago, one more time going away, one more time abandoning him, one more time departure for hippy life or whatever marginal adventure of drugs, alcohol and promiscuity. She introduces him to her being sick, in fact dying within months, and to his son, Forrest Junior who is about five and is not mentally or intellectually challenged. He takes them home and he buries her as soon as she dies. He then assumes the new role of his life, in his life, the role of father. I told you it was a fairy tale. Of course it is highly improbable a mentally and intellectually limited person can do all that and succeed so well, except if you consider you have to be mentally and intellectually challenged to be successful in American capitalism. But dreaming is a good thing. Dreaming that the President of the USA is intellectually challenged. That would be a good idea right now in 2018. Dreaming that this American society is managed by a capitalist system that is itself managed by such luminaries of imbecility. No future indeed. Dreaming that all American wars will be defeats and will end in some soft inhumanity. There you can dream over and over again: that is not going to happen. All American defeats will be in pain and blood, both foreign blood, mostly, and American blood, especially the blood of drones. But well, it is a nostalgic trip to those days of the 1950s and an allusion to the integration of the school and university system; the 1960s with Black Panthers and some allusion to Woodstock; the 1970s and some allusion to the Watergate Scandal; and the early 1980s and some allusion to the assassination attempt against Reagan echoing the successful assassinations against J.F. Kennedy and his \"little brother,\" though Martin Luther King's assassination is not alluded to. Memory and Nostalgia Lane is still the yellow brick road of some other older fairy tale.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

We see him grow up, sleep with Jenny, join the army, go to war in Vietnam, open a shrimping business, with his deceased friend in mind, him buy a share in Apple Computers, him play college football, him meet three presidents, him teach Elvis his iconic move, his mother dying, him run across America for no particular reason, him finding out he had a child with Jenny, him marrying Jenny, Jenny dying of aids, because she was a giant hippie then a giant druggie. And everything important or relevant in his life. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",

The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being \"too clever by half.\" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough. He's a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.What a magical movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Excellent film with a great performance by Tom Hanks",
    "reviewBody": "Tom Hanks has proved over the years that he is a talented and versatile actor and his performance as Forrest Gump is easily one of his best (only his performance in Philadelphia was better in my opinion from his films I've seen).But it's not only Hanks performance that makes this film remarkable, but the story itself. Forrest Gump is an unintelligent man, but he has a heart of gold. We get to learn about his life story and everything from childhood, his college years to his service in the army in Vietnam to his eventual marriage to Jenny. We get to see Gump's struggles through life as he is picked on for being unintelligent and we also get to see some happy moments in the 2 strong friendships Gump forms with one of his army buddies (Bubba) in Vietnam and his childhood friend and eventually his wife Jenny.What is also great about Forrest Gump? The fact that we are presented with a central character who we can sympathise with. It is all too easy sometimes for film makers and their writers to create characters who we are supposed to care about, but we start out hating, and hate them throughout the film and then hate them at the end. This is not the case with the character of 'Forrest Gump' It is impossible not to like Forrest as he shows that although he isn't bright, he is still capable of showing his emotions and empathy towards others i.e his protectiveness for Jenny, and when he rescues most of his platoon in Vietnam. Whilst Forrest Gump is a serious film, it does have many funny moments like when Jenny tells Forrest Gump that she has a son called Forrest and that she named him after his dad and Forrest Gump turns round and says 'He's got a daddy called Forrest too'. Obviously she then tells him that Forrest is his son.Is this film perfect? Not quite - Forrest Gump's continual running seemed pointless to me, although it was fun to watch.Forrest Gump is a wonderful film with a basic story about the life of a truly remarkable person and is well worth your time.",

    "reviewBody": "I remember hearing so much about this film and after a great year at the box office that had seen the release of Pulp Fiction and the underrated intersection, I thought that this film, from the director of \"Back to the future\" would surely not fail to the disappoint.Boy was I wrong. Bob Gale must have thanked God that Zemeckis hired someone else for this self-absorbed piece of tripe. The film resembles the films of the eighties that were trying to show female empowerment by having them think and act like men, that you watch now with a odd sense of embarrassment. That's what this film is to the disabled. It tries hard to seem so enlightened and yet most of the film's attitude is mocking. The way he just happens to become a football hero, because lets face it, in America if you're disabled then that's the only way to get acceptance from Bullies. Firstly why would someone want acceptance from Bullies and more importantly what the hell does that say about the world that this is the message Zemeckis is sending out.The film then becomes a horrible mish-mash as Tom Hanks is badly imposed in old film clips of chat shows and presidents, and the only plus of the film comes in the shape of a great performance by Gary Sinese that is spoilt by a cheesy ending where he forgives the Vietnamese by falling for a Vietnamese woman (Kind of like a really naff version of my name is earl.) If there is any justice in this world then this will fall down the list and out of the 250, but unfortunately the world is not just and if this film indicated that, then it would have a higher ranking from me.",

    "reviewBody": "Some movies get such a ridiculous amount of acclaim that I have no choice but to be skeptical watching them. I say this because there's a ton of films that people view favorably only for nostalgia and not much else. For the longest time, I thought that this was the case with Forrest Gump, a movie that is often seen as one of the best in recent memory. Having never seen it before, I asked myself if it was actually worth seeing or just something that has been overhyped to an untouchable degree. After watching the whole movie, I can say that it is pretty impressive and well worth your time, but maybe it's not as amazing as everyone says. Personally, I thought it was good because of its subject matter. The story involves american history, but it is partially fictionalized in order to bring attention to the title character. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a slow-witted man with an IQ barely above that of a 9 year old child. Although he's not very intelligent, his actions speak louder than words, and he shows up in numerous important historical events. The vast majority of the movie is told through flashbacks while he's sitting on a bench in Alabama in the 1980s. He tells people who sit next to him about his tragic (but also heroic) life story, starting with his childhood in the 1950s. Forrest explains how he was named after the famed southern civil war general Nathan Bedford Forrest, the only man in the whole war to be promoted all the way to general while starting out as a mere private. Forrest talks about how he had to have metal braces on his legs from a young age because of a physical disability, which actually inspired Elvis Presley's famous (somewhat vulgar) dance moves. As Forrest attends school for the first time, he meets a girl named Jenny (Robin Wright) who quickly becomes his one and only friend, as she is one of the only people to not mock him. As they grow up together, Forrest lives through more monumental events, such as meeting President Kennedy and seeing the first black students walk into an Alabama college. Eventually, things take a turn for the worst and Forrest is drafted into vietnam. While there, he meets his commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan, whose military heritage stretches back all the way to the war of independence. Vietnam proves to be a harrowing experience for Gump, who comes close to losing his life numerous times. He even runs back into a jungle to save his lieutenant from being burned to death after the area is marked for a napalm attack. However, all is not well because Lieutenant Dan survives, but loses both of his legs, leaving him a miserable invalid. At first, he hates Forrest for \"robbing him of an honorable death\", but the two come to respect each other. After the war ends in the 1970s, Forrest is sent home and lives with Dan in NYC for a while. Forrest invests in a relatively unknown little company (Apple Inc.) at the end of the 70s and gives much of the money to the family of Bubba, a soldier Forrest served alongside in vietnam. By now, Forrest no doubt misses Jenny, and runs all across the United States for years on end to keep his mind busy. Jenny, who had become a drug addict during the counterculture of the 60s, returns to Forrest and marries him in the early 1980s. Dan shows up at their wedding, revealing he has new prosthetic legs. Unfortunately, Forrest's marriage is very brief as Jenny reveals she has some kind of unknown virus (possibly hepatitis), and she dies the next year. Forrest visits her grave to say goodbye, and the movie ends with Forrest wishing his son good luck on his first day at school. I have to say, I was really impressed with this movie. I still think it's overrated, but not without plenty of good reasons. For one thing, it involves history, which is a good thing (for me). It also shows how lucky Forrest is, despite being unintelligent. He just so happened to live through all these famous events. I made an attempt to describe some of them, but there's a lot more. After Forrest gets wounded in vietnam, he meets the president (again) and shows his injury to LBJ. Another scene has him meeting Abbie Hoffman and giving a speech about why the war in vietnam is immoral. Because this movie is so long and contains so many different settings, it's quite hard to write about. It's just one of those experiences that can't really be put into words because unless you've seen it, you don't really understand. I just appreciated how it showed Forrest staying with his vietnam veteran friend all the way into the 80s, which often happened in real life. Of course, like many who came back from that conflict, Forrest gets disrespected upon arriving home for participating in what many considered organized murder. It was a big shock to me when I found out that Robert Zemeckis directed this, since I only knew about him from Back to the Future. As you might guess from a movie of this magnitude, the acting is all really well done. Tom Hanks won an oscar for his portrayal of Forrest, as he's much more than just an idiot. He's a patriot, warrior, father, and comrade. He has people who depend on him. Robin Wright as Jenny is probably the saddest thing about the movie, as she's one of the only people who appreciates Forrest, so seeing her die so early in their marriage was really terrible. The last major character (but definitely not least) is Lieutenant Dan, played by Gary Sinise. He reminds me a lot of stereotypical drill sergeant characters, since he's tough on the exterior, but he really cares about his men. He has few ways of showing it, and he's even initially hostile to Gump, but he later considers him his best friend for saving his life in southeast asia. Overall, Forrest Gump is a surprisingly emotional and sad movie, but it also has many funny aspects to it. I usually say that only the best movies can make an audience laugh, make them scared, or sad within only one film. In this case I really do think it's fitting.",

    "reviewTitle": "A magical fictional biographical story",
    "reviewBody": "This review contains spoilers.Forrest Gump is a movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks. The movie follows Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, a mentally challenged man as a child to an adult. The story begins with Forrest telling his story to random strangers at a bus stop.Forrest Gump is an entertaining movie. The movie's pacing is incredibly quick and there is never a dull moment. It is astonishing to see so much of Forrest's life displayed on the screen. Each stage of Forrest's life has its own struggles and stories contributes so well to Forrest's story. A lot of this is because Robert Zemeckis' fine direction and Tom Hanks' engagement into his character. Tom Hanks narrates all of the flashbacks and often times narration does not offer much over the visuals; here in the scenes, Forrest's narration helps keep the scenes engaging. A lot of this is also helped by the pacing which keeps every stage fresh.Forrest Gump follows many small stories from Forrest's youth with his inability to run to his time in the Vietnam War. All of these stories have meaning to Forrest and because of this the movie can stand on that alone. Forrest's first story with his inability to walk properly helps the audience get behind Forrest's struggles. It becomes easy to root for Forrest after seeing him overcome his disability. This continues throughout the movie and the story does touch on some surprising emotional notes.Forrest Gump has a great soundtrack. Each period of time has period appropriate music and the movie absolutely benefits as a result.Forrest Gump is highly recommended. The movie is a complete package with wonderful directing and an excellent lead actor. This movie has something for everyone to enjoy in it like a box of chocolates.Grade: A",

The movie stars Tom Hanks in his 2nd Oscar winning portrayal as Gump a simple man with a low I.Q. but with good intentions. He is running his childhood with his best and only friend Jenny (played by young Hanna Hall). His mom (played by Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his own destiny. Then he goes to college and makes the football team while in college, and then goes to the army for the Vietnam War finding new friends Lt. Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise) and Bubba (played by Mykleti Williamson). He wins medals and creates a shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, create a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, with bumper stickers and songs, donating to the people, and meeting the president several times. However it's all irrelevant to him when he can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright). This was an inspiring masterpiece for the whole family to watch and also one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his entire career and Robert Zemeckis' boldest feature film he had ever made.",

    "reviewTitle": "I know the meaning after running",
    "reviewBody": "The correct life is generally experienced by \"running\". When running continuously, you can see the end point or not see the end point. You are advancing as much as possible. Every time you encounter a post on the way, you can choose to pass by or Staying, each choice may lead to countless results, just like you cannot predict the taste of the next piece of chocolate, and every time you think, there may not be an answer. As in the doubts mentioned in the movie, do we each have their own destiny, or Like a feather, drifting in the wind. The time background of the film is modern America. Some details of the era are seen in many details of the film. Some historical events have been moved to the screen. The film can learn about the reputation of Forrest Gump, because in many historical events He was left in the middle. The story that was asked to be quoted during the filming process must be an event that actually happened, and all of this has been done realistically, including the editing of some shots, which are all materials that once existed. This is a very serious production. A-Gump almost ran a whole movie. He experienced life and death parting all his life, and ran through many places. Every time he stayed at a node, there was a small turning point in his life. This turning point would prompt him to continue running, as if Life can no longer stop. Every time he started his long-distance running, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a khaki trousers, and later a cap and a pair of running shoes. These shoes have been in the movie for a few seconds. The close-up shot of has now become a fashion trend leader and has been loved by many friends. A-Gump also treated everything he insisted on with a serious attitude. He could even say that he had done two things of persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things made him hit by mistake and reached many unexpected achievements. He did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he is himself, not others, his purpose is only to be himself, even if he does not understand how to be himself, he actually understands, in him After running through so many corners. Finally, when he sent his son to the school bus, the scene was like his own childhood. At this time, the child was wearing a blue and white plaid shirt, a red cap, and a familiar look. When the father and son were fishing together by the river, the son tilted his head to the left like A-Gump, this is the same gesture. The connection between them has been expressed through many lenses. Forrest Gump may want to convey his spirit to his son. He does not need to do a lot of homework because he is not very good at it, but he will give his son a subtle influence. Son In the future, he will become a person who possesses his character but is smarter than him. I believe it will bring greater honor to his father.",

    "reviewBody": "I'll start like this; Do you want to know how it's possible to in fact consider The Shawshank Redemption as an eternal classic? Well, because The Shawshank Redemption is without question, a superior film to Forrest Gump, and the funny thing is, Forrest Gump is truly an amazing film. That's how you can tell how amazing The Shawshank Redemption was, because it is better than another amazing, super amazing film.Forrest Gump was released over 20 years ago, and this is the first time I finally got to watch, finally got to see the film who's shadow The Shawshank Redemption lived under, and what an entertaining and stunning watch it was, however, I just can't get over how this film took away all the spotlight from well, TSR.I guess I'm reviewing both movies in one here, because they are two films which are so worthy, while one, though received multiple Oscar Nominations, was unjustly ignored, and I'm just not able to do so while watching Forrest Gump, but in the same breath, I sincerely don't blame Forrest Gump either, because like I've been saying, it is a fantastic film.Forrest Gump is what happens when you just don't overthink anything, while still maintaining a pure heart. The man just, did. No words, all actions. No analyzing, just commitment. Sure perhaps, there may have been some luck, however, because of how Forrest went about his life, luck was neither here nor there, and on top of that, though he may have been lucky, he also did experience immense and intense heartbreak, and that, perhaps makes all the difference.Sivestri and Zemeckis were in the zone, and that is the best way I can put it. The visual effects, especially for that time were superb. The action bits, in such a drama driven movie were so well positioned and the way this film was tying into the past and the future was appropriately humorous.The relationship between him and Jenny is such a beautiful tragedy. A happily ever after between the two of them would've just ruined this film, and that sucks, because damn it, Gump deserved better than her, but we also wanted him to be with her because well; \"Forrest, I'll always be your girl\". Also, the way Zemeckis told the story, allowed for Jenny's childhood story to come through for her, and explain to us that, Jenny was lost, broken and stuck, held prisoner by her past. Without having to be graphic about it, or delve way to deep into it, we knew that Jenny's heart was bleeding, long before she knew it was, and so knowing that, though Forrest may have deserved better, she deserved him. That is so weird and beautiful and just absolutely tragic.The Shawshank Redemption is better, however, Forrest Gump is not worse. 8.4/10.",

Actually, it's quite the opposite! You grow to love Forrest Gump and you can totally understand where Jenny is coming from considering what she's been through and the time period they live in. This movie show us the time period it takes place in so well and it ties in the events that happened during that time incredibly well. Many people don't get the message of the movie. It's not just some dumb guy taking part in random events throughout history because of luck. No. Absolutely not. Forrest Gump tells an inspiring story about a man, seen inferior by others because he's not intelligent, who accomplishes some of the most incredible things some of us could only dream of doing. Why did he do them? Because he felt like it. The message of this movie is, anyone can do anything, no matter where they stand in society or where they come from. If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish it.There aren't many, or any bad things I can say about this movie, so I'll just say this.

    "reviewTitle": "Retard Yourself With Retro-Culture!",
    "reviewBody": "If you're like me you hate to think; even worse is thinking about history- so much moral ambiguity, so much perspective and bothersome shades of grey... isn't there a movie out there that can assure me that everything that happened during the latter-half of the twentieth century was Just Fine- all while deafening me with jukebox favorites?Now you can! Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks proudly present \"Forrest Gump\" a left-wing work of right-wing propaganda that boldly proclaims the mentally retarded are not just AS GOOD as you and me, but better! And as a result, American Heroes! Forrest's IQ is charted at seventy, which means he will stay boyishly naive until the script calls for him to suddenly make a profound declaration for the Oscar clip: \"I'm not a smart man... but I know what love is.\" Whatchyou talking' bout, Forrest? This is retro-active re-writing of pop-culture disguised as American history designed to make us all feel better about not understanding the exact details of the Watergate break-in or the black panther party. Forrest floats through life with the gravity- and substance- of a feather, tossing off sickeningly-pointless nothingisms: \"Life is like a box of chocolates...\" No, it isn't.It really, really isn't.His erstwhile girlfriend goes through every cliché of cultural extremism (flower child, disco burnout, AIDS corpse) to lecture the audience about the dangers of Actually Being Involved In Something! We'll be much better off if we listen to Mama like Forrest and dip our toes in the water only for the sake of a digitally-enhanced photo-opportunity. (Love the way you moved Lennon's lips to set up your clunker of a joke... that took a lot of class!) And finally the mystery of who taught Elvis to dance has been solved- it was a crippled simpleton, and not the butler as previously suspected.But the adventures don't end there: Zemeckis (Greek for arrogant-ignorant) wants us to believe that this Drooling Dandy was an integral part of EVERY significant historical event: Gump meets JFK, carves Mount Rushmore, builds the sun, performs open-heart surgery! Forrest saves a fellow soldier during The War (good) who happens to be black (better) and inherits a shrimping boat (obviously)... we meet Gary Sinise's Lieutenant Dan who has the gall to question Gump's ability; for this his legs are blown off and he's doomed to an entire life of pain and suffering. Don't fear the retard...All of Forrest's toothless adventures are washed down with some of the most over-played soundtrack songs of the era, until the Dumb One takes to the road for a series of painful gags, increasing exponentially in stupidity until finally he's left with the motherless son he never wanted nor could possibly raise. (It's the next best thing to Immaculate Conception.) Are we vomiting yet?Ultimately, Forrest Gump proves that Tom Hanks was so good in \"Philadelphia\" that we weren't finished giving him Oscars, and the movie's other trophies only go to prove that we're the very lemmings They think we are, preferring glossy bile over thought-provoking quality.This is \"Pop-Culture for Dummies\" masquerading as American History and quality film. Will rot your brain like crack-cocaine.GRADE: F",

    "reviewBody": "It seems that most people either love \"Forrest Gump\" or hate it. I am right down the middle. I didn't find this movie to be a masterpiece, but I thought that it was interesting how they did it. The title character (Tom Hanks) is of course a retarded Alabaman who grows up with his single mother (Sally Field). Throughout the movie, he plays a part in almost every major event of the post-WWII era, and in the process meets several distinguished personalities. All the while, he continues trying to get back together with his sweetheart Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn). Toeing the line between comedy (he shows his butt to LBJ) and drama (his friend Bubba gets killed in Vietnam), the movie never gets idiotic, although it was intermittently sappy.Either way, I liked \"Forrest Gump\". It was the first Best Picture winner that I saw in the theaters, but I didn't consider it the best movie of 1994. In my opinion, that distinction goes to the under-appreciated \"Shawshank Redemption\".Tom Hanks sure has come a long way since his debut, the slasher flick \"He Knows You're Alone\".",

They live happily together. At the end of the film, when Forrest Gump stands in front of Jenny's grave and says in a South Alabama accent, \"I love you, Jenny.\" It was in our eyes that tears flashed in our eyes, not because the fool finally married Jenny, but because the fool had feelings that many smart people did not have: love.

    "reviewTitle": "A poisonous pill with a sugar coating (loads of spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "I loathe and despise this film on so many different levels.Firstly, how did Tom Hanks win an Oscar for speaking very slowly. I have never seen such a collective display of acting incompetence be so highly lauded.Secondly, The central message of this film is (spoilers) America is better than everywhere else in the world. Don't get me wrong, I like America. I love Americans, I waste massive amounts of my time and money on movies, music, and books produced in America- but this bloody movie is a typical of why so many people now seem to be anti-US. If you look at the lengths the \"good\" characters go to conform to society's ideal- his mother having sex with the principal, for example- they will behave in an immoral fashion to further their own lives within the American ideal. Furthermore, just in case this subtle point flew over the heads of the audience, the sole character to attempt to break from this conformity is killed with AIDS.Thirdly, I know it is a movie, a work of fiction etc, so there must be some suspension of disbelief, but this simply goes to far. How does a mentally handicapped kid from a redneck backwater manage to meet a significant amount of noteworthy 20th century figures, and be present at so many of the last centuries significant events? Also, why does no-one tell him where to go when he is waffling on at the bus stop?Next Up- no-one ever seems to comment on this, but this film is BORING. It is a string of randomly connected events, some of which are so tedious that when I first saw it I literally felt my brain melting. For example (spoiler) when he goes running for god knows how long for no apparent reason- then stops again for no apparent reason. The sheer pointlessness of this section made me want to cry out of frustration. This film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long- not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but at least half an hour over time. The running section could easily (for example) have ended up on the cutting room floor without detracting from the movie in any way. This is actually typical of so much of the movie- (spoilers) Elvis does not add anything to the plot (except irritation), the table tennis scenes, the section with the prostitutes in New York, I could go on and on but frankly cannot be bothered. The basic storyline, as reliant as it is on suspension of disbelief etc, is essentially quite simple. (spoiler)Retarded boy from red neck backwater attends several famous events and through god's good graces and America's providence has a fabulously successful life, whilst losing the only woman he ever loved, and making some life-long friends. Easy, biographical story, not without a heartwarming premise. Instead we have a bloated, appalling, falsely moralistic, repugnant propaganda sequence constructed from a series of irritating set pieces and laden with pseudo-meaningful interludes. Why was it not made as a simple fictional biopic?Finally, I am not pro-feminist at all, but this movie made my stomach turn in it's treatment of the female characters. All the women of the movie are morally loose- whether it is his mother, love of his life (the only two complete female characters anyway), or any of the minor characters (two hookers leaps to mind), they all display a worrying lack of morals.Overall this movie is 140 minutes of my life that I want back. I feel violated for having seen this saccharine wrapped pile of excrement- I think I have given enough reasons for why it is the worst movie of all time without even going into it's wallowing in sentimentality, or dismal direction, or even looking at the waste of fine actors (Sally field, Gary Sinese etc). That Tom Hanks won his second Oscar for this overrated pile of garbage shows what an absolute travesty the Academy voting system is.",

A balance that pure drama and pure comedies often fail to achieve. To me, this film was more touching than movies that were intended to be mainly touching turned out to be. In that, Forrest Gump was a masterpiece.You see the small things he does and the greatness he inspires and causes in people all around him without having much intelligence. This helps remind us that no matter what kind of person we are, no matter what physical or mental capabilities we have, we still can cause so much greatness in people's lives both intentionally and in ways that we don't even know.The movie is also inspiration in that you see a picked on persevere and either not notice or completely ignore the ridicule and setbacks he faces. He takes it and he runs as hard as he can.His plain and complete niceness reminds us that it doesn't take much to be nice and cause positive change in other people's lives.Also, the bus scene setups were great, enabling the great flashback style and narration storytelling that made it great. It was finally great to see in the end someone who actually stayed to care and listen and skip their bus.Great movie. One of my favorite.",

    "reviewTitle": "The world from a different viewpoint",
    "reviewBody": "I watched this a very long time ago, but I never really appreciated this movie. It must have been because I was very young. I wasn't even born when the movie first aired! However, I do remember a few scenes from this movie. The ones that stuck with me throughout the years were the very, very sad scene of Bubba dying and the oh-so-famous quote: \"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\" This movie starts with a feather floating in the background, getting flown all over in the place, when finally it lands beside some dirty rubber shoes. The owner of these shoes, Forrest Gump, picks it up and keeps it. He just sits there, quietly all by himself, when a woman sits beside him on his bench. He then greets her and thus, begins the narration of his life story.His story is wonderful. I loved everything about it. Forrest wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. On top of that, he couldn't even walk properly. His IQ was a poor 75 and he couldn't even get accepted into a public school. But his mother did everything for Forrest. His mother was great. You could see she struggling.I thought it was very cute the way Jenny and Forrest's friendship blossomed. How she invited him to sit beside her. The way they hung around with each other in their tree and just talked about anything and everything. Jenny was very protective of Forrest. When the first bullying encounter happened and Jenny told Forrest to run? That made my skin have goosebumps. It just felt good. \"Run, Forrest! Run!\" I also never realized back then that Jenny was having trouble with her father. But now, I understand. Jenny's prayer was also.. Amazing. \"Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far. Far far away from here.\" That just touched me.After his friendship with Jenny, Forrest met Bubba during the Vietnam War, after he finished college. During the scene where Forrest first entered the bus, it was like the first day of school all over again! Nobody would let Forrest sit with him. Until he came upon a guy who had a weird lip jutting out. That was the start of their strong brotherhood.I felt like the time they spent together was so short. I didn't even cry when Bubba died. It was weird since I was expecting to cry, seeing as how Bubba's scene was the one that stayed with me all throughout the years. I'm so disappointed in my lack of emotional attachment. But I still love Bubba. :) It was nice how Forrest went on with his shrimp catching business just for the sake of keeping his promise to Bubba.The two things that changed during my previous screenings and the one I had tonight were 1.) I liked Lt. Dan more than I thought I would and 2.) Jenny wasn't all that great.I'll talk about Lt. Dan first. First of all, I didn't even remember him! I was even shocked when I saw that his legs were cut off! See how much that \"didn't\" affect me. But he was a good friend. He became one of Forrest's best friends. He even stood up for him when one of the hookers called Forrest stupid. I thought Dan didn't care, but that proved me wrong. They even became partners with the whole Bubba-Gump thing. Sweet.Now, about Jenny. I don't see why Forrest liked her. Yes, I get that they were friends since childhood, but after they grew out of their childhood, she kept leaving him! I was so mad after she left him during \"the morning after\". At least that sparked Forrest's will to run all over America. Hm.The ending was great. I forgot all about that. What a welcome surprise. It's just a shame that Jenny died, too, in the end. All of Forrest's loved ones passed away. All he's got left is Little Forrest. I guess in a way, that was nice. He had someone to look after and someone to look after him. :) There were a lot of great cameos that I was on a look out for. I loved that Elvis part! I even took a second look to check if that guy was really Elvis! Yes. I know. It's impossible since he's already dead, but hey! It seemed realistic. There were also meetings with different presidents. And a deal he had with a very famous \"fruit company\". The cameos just kept coming and coming. And it worked! The main message of this movie was that life just keeps on going. Bad things are inevitable, but you can trust that there will be a million good things that will come your way. It's a movie about life. Forrest Gump teaches you things. He sees the world from a different viewpoint. Not an idiot's viewpoint. But a child-like sort-of perspective. No biases at all. Just an average things-the-way-they-actually-are perspective. This is one movie you mustn't dare miss. Wonderful movie. Just wonderful.",

I watched this film in theaters in the US and people were cheering at the Vietnam scenes and when Forrest gets his share at Apple Mackintosh.

    "reviewBody": "Tom Hanks proves he is America's actor as really he is such a great and awesome actor and plays the everyman of the world like it is really a real person and not the actor.Forrest Gump is a not too bright man but really has great intentions and a heart of gold. And only wants to be a part of his one and only friend's Jenny's life played by Robin Wright.As unintentionally he becomes part of the greatest historic events like Watergate, civil rights issues, the Vietnam War, and ping pong champion as he in the war, meets his mentor and soon to be friend, Lt Dan played by Gary Sinise.He remains his true humble self along with only his heart of gold and simple yet lovable self.Really a great film with acting, directing, and heart of soul and gold. As we don't get much films these days. Way to go Tom and the other actors!",

    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump (1994) is one of the greatest Oscar Winning Movies. It won Best Picture, Best VFX, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Film Editing. It was one of the best films I have ever seen.\nForrest Gumps casted Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Gary Sinises as Lieutenant Dan Taylor and more. First of all, the acting was extremely excellent, Tom Hanks could act like a stupid guy and he actually won an Oscar for that. It was really impressive.\nThe story was really good. Starting the time when there was president John F. Kennedy and there was was in Vietnam (my country, it made me so proud of having Vietnam in such a good movie). It was an Alabama man with an IQ of 75. I could imagine that being Forrest Gump was the greatest thing. Bullied, called stupid is fine, many people though it would make you an outcast.\nThis was such a good movie that some day I want to see it again and again and again. The scenes are really unforgettable with humor and tragedy. I laughed and cried (whenn Jenny and Bubba are dead). It was the most unforgettable movie ever.\nWell, I had nothing left to say. Forrest Gump is a must-see. A 9.4/10",

Not to mention the soundtrack and the songs featured in the film that are simply goosebumps. If I have to find a small problem it may be the fact of some very small mounting error for example in one of the first scenes when Gump is chased by 3 bicycles at first they seem very far, then very close and then again very far away. But these are mistakes that I would not even weigh, truly a masterpiece I recommend the vision to everyone.",

    "reviewTitle": "why i hated Forrest Gump",
    "reviewBody": "I know I'm not the only one who hated this movie. In fact I'm not even the only person in my family that hated this movie, my mom and sister did too, and I have met other people who hated this movie throughout the years since it came out. Unfortunately, it hasn't been too many people at all.Enough of that, I of course looked and heard why people seem to like this movie so much. But I couldn't disagree more. The whole plot of the movie is ridiculous -- how a mentally challenged person could go through or cause all these historical events and fads. For example, creating the smiley face, the s*** happens bumper sticker, catching the people in the Watergate scandal, winning a medal of honor, becoming a ping-pong champion (like an American can ever win that!), becoming an all-American athlete for football, running across the country, falling in love with a drug-addicted stripper (well i guess this one's believable as he is mentally challenged), speaking out against the Vietnam war after he won the medal of honor for it, etc. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Running some more, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Then just quitting for no apparent reason, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!!OK, now the good parts of it. Yes there are some things I liked about the movie. The cinematography was beautiful (and I'm a big fan of this as I believe it helps set the tone of a movie), but it's useless because there is nothing for it to enhance. I also liked Gary Sinise in this; Lt. Dan is actually a cool character. And of course, the soundtrack is awesome...Now only if we can mute everyone but Gary Sinise and the music, I might be able to sit through this movie again. One can only hope...Now back to the not so good to outright horrible. I never read the book by Winston Groom so I can't say if they did the book justice or not, and I really don't care. I mentioned how much I hated the basic premise for this movie, but the dialog doesn't help either, with it's cheesy axioms and pathetic southern accents (I used to live in TN, and I don't remember the accents being that bad). Whatever, I can live with the accents, but I prefer the exaggerated ones in \"Fargo\" (I thought they sounded cool). Anyway, now onto the acting: Tom Hanks wasn't great in this movie at all. How hard is it to play somebody that doesn't change from one scene to the next. He walks, talks, and acts the same in every scene of the movie. This had to have been Hanks' easiest performance to play...and it won him his second Oscar. But of course this isn't the first time that's happened. See Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man,\" but at least that was a good movie.I like a lot of Robert Zemeckis's films by the way to include \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" \"Contact\" and even \"Beowulf,\" but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. I actually think the events of \"Star Wars 1-6\" were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. A lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; I don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but I don't have to agree. Also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. I always wondered what African Americans thought about some of the stuff in it as I don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it. I guess it's up to them to decide.Now onto the last part of my comment which doesn't have anything to do with why I like/dislike any part of the movie. I've been called a Communist, un-American, and other worse things for hating this movie. Really what is the point. I don't put other people down for not liking movies I like. Everybody's is entitled to their own opinion. Furthermore, I thought I lived in (and fought for) a country where I can like or dislike whatever movie I want. I don't like movies because everyone else does, and just because Hollywood or the media says that a movie is good, doesn't mean that it is. In fact I tend to disagree with Hollywood a lot. Anyway, isn't having to like something that's jammed down my throat communist in itself? Anyway, if I had to choose between becoming a communist and liking this movie, I would choose communism without a second thought or regret.If I was rating this movie on how much I actually liked it, I would give it a -infiniti just on the stupid screenplay alone. Too bad, it took awhile for \"The Shawshank Redemption\" to get popular, or that would have swept the Oscars that year.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Greatest Movie of all time.",
    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump is a story that follows two characters, one names Forrest, the other named Jenna.\nAs  says Forrest Gump is a simple relatively wealthy kid man with a low I.Q, but good intentions. What makes this move so great is how Gump goes through many of the historical events of the 20th century. From dancing with Elvis, to entering the Vietnam war, to witnesses the original moon landing on tv, to meeting the black panther organization, and even even witnessing the WaterGate Scandal that causes Nixon to retire. Gump goes through a lot of situations throughout his life, but he never lets anyone of them disturb his happiness. From we're wearing braces on his leg, to get in bullied in school, and as an adult, to even being shot. Gump never gives up and continues to believe things will workout all right. That faith always helps him out for example when he gets his braces of he discovers he can run extremely fast, and long, all that running from bullies paid off (insert famous Run Forrest Run Here scene here). Not only that because he runs so fast Football recruiters and coaches notice him allowing him to receive a football scholarship to the university of Alabama as a running back. Which then allows him to graduate college and join the military when a recruiter talks to him. Why he joins the military no reasons he just does it no real explanation to why.\nThat's the thing with his character he basically symbolizes the idea that somebody can make a difference no matter who they are, even the dumbest of the dumb. When he joins the military, he quickly able to fit, you realize Forrest really isn't that dumb. He able to quickly able to reassemble his gun in the military, faster than anyone in the U.S military existence.\nAnyway in the military he meets a man named Bubba and he comes the best of pals. Despite racism clearly being an issue as shown by the historical scene of the desegregation of the university of Alabama(extremely funny). Bubba and Him are quickly able to become the best of friends. To the point where the the Shrimp business he always talks with Forrest about, he eventually ask Forrest to come join him once's they leave the military. Which is sad cause Bubba ends up dying due to an injury.Anyway when he went to go save Lieutenant Dan his commander and a few other solid jets, Dan tells him to leave him, but Forrest doesn't listen. This causes Gump to become a war hero although Dan ends up losing his legs due to serious injuries. While in rehab Forrest Gump picks up a new skill as ping pong which allows him join the All America Ping Pong team and even meet JFK. He eventually meets lieutenant Dan again and the dude is a mess, he a hopeless goner since he couldn't die War like his ancestors. Although he joins Gump in his shrimping business challenges god to sink his ship when a huge hurricane hit's Louisian, and his ship is the only one that remains. Allowing Gump to monopolize the business and in the end they both become millionaires, as Dan takes over the business although he makes sure to replay Gump by making him a stock shared in Gump words a \"fruit company\"(Apple). Dan eventually get married and finds a wife.\nAnyway let's talk about Gump Mother she is an amazing single mother who only ever wanted the best for her child. To the point where she ends up having sex with a school principal early on in the move just so that her child could go to a better school. She always tells Gump \"life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get\". Basically mean life is unpredictable, it's full of surprises. You pick and piece of chocolate and you eat it, you may like it, but when you pick again you might not like the other one. Does that mean you stop eating from those boxes of chocolate no you keep eating a trying the next, who knows you may like the rest of them. When she dies of Cancer Later on in the story it's very sad.Now let's talk about Jenna her and Gump relationships. Jenna starts her life of being sexually abused by her father and that's a common theme in her life in away. Which Forrest Descirbes as \"always kissing and touching Jenny and her sisters\". The men in her life are constantly abusing her yet the one man who never even think about touching her, constantly rejects him. Jenny was originally Gumps only friend as everyone else treated him like the \"idiot\" he was, she was the only one who let Gump sit with her on the bus on his first day at school. She was the one who told Gump to \"Run Forrest Run\" from the bullies. Jenny ends up posing for a Playboy while in college and ends up getting expelled. Which causes her to perform and sing for a strip club pretty much nude. Anyway Forrest Gump doesn't like how the men grabbed her just like how he didn't like her boyfriend in college grabbing her and beats them up. Cussing Jenna to be fired, anyway before leaving for the military Jenny worried about the Vietnam war tells Forrest if he is ever scared in Vietnam to just run away. She still gives him advice even though he just got her fired meaning she probably didn't like the job anyway.\nForrest is constantly writing her letter in the Military, but is never getting any of them back, although they do end up uniting a few year later in Washington D.C, following a mostly muted Anti War Speech Gump was about to accidentally participate in. The two spend the day together and converge at a Black Panther Party sage house, however Jenny boyfriend at the time and the Party members weren't happy swing Forrest there. Jenny and her boyfriend eventually get in an argument in which the boyfriend slaps Jenny and Gump goes ballistic. Forres and Jenny are forced to leave and they spend the rest of the night reflecting on there journeys. Jenny ends up leaving for Berkeley's with the same boy that hit her, although not before Gump giver her his Congressional Medal of Honor reward, and saying she is her girl to which Jenny replies I'll always be your girl. Jenny ends going though a really rough time after this she has succumbed further into a life of drugs and instability. Battered and high she comes closed to committing suicide. Jenny eventually gets her life together and becomes a waitress and ends up meeting Gump, she has a child now who she named Forrest Jump Junior. We don't really know if it's really it's Gump kid or not but he accepts Gump Jr. as his own kid. We find out that Jenny is ill and suffering from an I own virus at the time know as HIV. Which prompts Forrest to tell them to come live with him and he promises to come take care of both of them. Jenny ask Forrest if he will marry her and he agree with great happiness. She ends up dying later on, and the saddest scene appear with Gump talking to her at her grave. Jenny finally accepted the one man that truly cared for her and she ends up dying. Sad, at least Gump jr is very bright. Forrest Gump is an amazing story and it's a must watch.",

    "reviewTitle": "Brilliant in every sense of the word",
    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump is truly a magical film or creativity and imagination. Portrayed by a soon to be superstar in Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump brings out the innocence and beauty of life. It is a story so compelling, so well thought out and so brilliantly portrayed it goes down in history as one of the most imaginative films of the 20th century. Forrest Gump is a boy with a very low I.Q., 75 to be precise. All he is trying to do is to go through life and be happy. Forrest never registers much, he takes in a lot and is always looking to be nice to anyone he comes across. Always an entertainer he is capable of a great story which you'll see right off the bat. The movie of Forrest Gump is not really a story but more of a biography of a fictional character. It is brilliantly done.Tom Hanks has grown to be one of the best actors in Hollywood. His sense of character development is beyond belief. He is able to take a pretty much simple character as Forrest Gump is and make him into one of the most interesting characters in the past 20 years. His sheer genius and comedy made the movie what it is today and that is a classic.Gary Sinise adds a very strong supporting role as Lt. Dan who is an old military 'buddy' from Vietnam. A lot of the mid story of the film follows the friendship that kindles between Forrest and the stern Lieutenant Dan. Sinise does some amazing work and is a highly underrate actor. He brings the fear of life to his character and when him and Hanks are on screen together, it is some of the best acting in the film.The film has gone down in history as its amazing presentation of historical events with a character from the movie in them. Forrest goes through a variety of events including: Vietnam, the Watergate Scandal, meeting John Lennon along with some other events of history. Along with Hanks acting, the special effects used to put characters in those events captures a lot of people attention and interest.Forrest Gump should not be missed. It's funny, it's smart, it's brilliantly acted. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have a good time. Don't miss Forrest Gump.5/5 Stars",

    "reviewBody": "Tom Hanks stars in his Oscar winning role in the best picture winning instant classic, Forrest Gump. When making Forrest Gump, it seems like director Robert Zemeckis' only goal is for this film to be a classic. And it truly is.Forrest Gump is the story of a guy named Forrest(obviously played brilliantly by Tom Hanks), a guy who has an I.Q. of 75. Forrest, throughout the entire film, is telling his life story. And his experiences. From his love for Jenny(played by Robin Wright Penn), who eventually becomes a hippie slut, to his days in the war, from his encounter with Elvis, and it goes on.Tom Hanks' performance is so delightfully sweet. and so is the movie. Forrest Gump is delightfully funny, blissfully sad, and downright sweet and a ton of fun. My momma doesn't like this movie. I don't know why. I may never understand it.When I think about it, I don't think it deserved best movie of the year over Pulp fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. But sometimes I do think that it did. Forrest is such a lovable character. And he has such an exiting life.The ending is sad, the film is a little sentimental, but it's not a problem, the acting is terrific. Especially from Tom Hanks and Gary Senise as the lovable Lieutenant Dan. Forrest Gump is a delightful film. One of the best pictures of 94. Not positive if it's the best, but it makes the top three no doubt.Forrest Gump: A+",

    "reviewBody": "Surely Forrest Gump must rate as one of the biggest dupes of all time. Quite how the marketeers managed to pass this off as a great film is beyond my powers of reason. Tom Hanks plays the intellectually challenged Gump and picked up his second consecutive Oscar for his over the top portrayal. A spectacular job considering the Academy do not normally fall for the same ploys as the movie going public. Even more spectacular when you consider that Morgan Freeman was nominated for The Shawshank Redemption. Gump was the Best Film winner as well, even though Pulp Fiction AND The Shawshank Redemption were nominated. I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years or Dazed and Confused, nice but nothing special. It's little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how it affected one man, namely Mr Gump. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gump's Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field is well cast as Gump's mother, beyond that there is not much to redeem Gump, the effects are very nicely added if nothing new and the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers. For the most part it's too mushy, way too sentimental and just not much above mediocre. In years to come the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump.",

The way his character is tied into and around several major historical events is very cleverly done, with good dashes of humour to balance out the more serious aspects referenced in the film, it's done excellently and designed perfectly!From the start to the finish, it's a story that's heartwarming inclusive of the audience; it will make you smile, it will make you laugh, and there are definitely parts that will make you cry from the powerful emotion conveyed in the acting of the characters.On my list of greatest movies ever, this one will always hold a special place for most people.

    "reviewBody": "...because when you have unprotected sex with an HIV positive woman, and that woman has a child, you run a sort of, well, \"high risk\" of receiving HIV (especially Forrest Jr).  I guess \"Jennay\" forgot to tell that to Forrest before she died.  GET TESTED, FORREST, and RUN!I don't mean to be abrasive, but after a second viewing of \"Forrest Gump,\" I noticed this glaring omission.  Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have included something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.  To me, this is a giant hole in the film, and one that needed to be addressed.And regarding the film itself...Personally, I'm in the middle; I don't love or hate \"Forrest Gump.\"  The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the film, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable and humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.  In the end, the good outweighed the bad slightly, and I came away satisfied but not totally pleased.  Zemeckis has made better films (try \"Back to the Future,\" \"Contact,\" and even \"Cast Away\"), and so has Hanks.I recommend \"Forrest Gump\" marginally because it has a good heart and a good, interesting story...but it also has its fair share of flaws.  \"Pulp Fiction\" and especially \"The Shawshank Redemption\" deserved the Academy Awards, but oh well...don't complain over something so trivial...awards don't mean THAT much.\"Forrest Gump\" can have a 7/10 from me.",

    "reviewTitle": "Forrest Gump",
    "reviewBody": "I think I've seen this film now about five or six times, the most of them when I was between 10 and 15, and now from a little distance it seems not illogical. \"Forrest Gump\" definitely is a film very suited for children with much of its not too subtle humour and you can recognize that it is generally made for a large, large audience with all its political correctness and clean showing of sexuality (I mean you can't offend anyone, can't you?). The background sound is provided by a huge amount of popular classics of the time. It's also funny how the film connects different historical occasions and persons and weaves them into the overall story, what makes a big part of the films charm. This film has heart, that's why I still like it, although there are some negative qualities that are reaching surface more and more for me. The main thing is that it's just too overly soapy dramatized. And after multiple viewings also Tom Hanks' acting starts going really on my nerves.",

    "reviewTitle": "The most ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life",
    "reviewBody": "OK, before I tear this movie to shreds, exactly HOW many Academy Awards did the stupid thing win? No, wait, don't tell me. I have a feeling the answer will depress me.This hype--er, movie--is a living testament to the fact that the baby boomers are incredible suckers. It's quite simple, really. You make a movie that romanticizes the '50's, '60's and '70's, and with enough publicity and a good enough soundtrack, no matter how bad the movie is, you have a hit on your hands. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the generation is stupid or shallow by any means; I'm merely saying that perhaps the haze of nostalgia that obstructed their view of the movie screen during Forrest Gump is what made this trash a hit.Because Forrest Gump is one ridiculous, unbelievable joke followed by another, and when Forrest isn't teaching Elvis how to dance, giving Lennon the idea for \"Imagine\" or, in an embarrassing scene I only WISH I could call \"forgettable\", wiping his face on a clean shirt and making a smiley face with the dirt by accident (\"Have a nice day,\" he says to the man who gave him the shirt, thankfully ending one of the \"clever\" scenes that surely had everyone rolling in the aisles); his life is taking another depressing turn that makes this less \"feel-good movie of 1994\" than \"number 1 movie of 1994 to commit suicide to\". He's born crippled with an IQ of 75; the neighborhood kids taunt and throw rocks at him; his \"girlfriend\" Jenny leads him on hopelessly while sleeping with every man in America except for him; his best friend dies in Vietnam and his superior has his legs blown off. Feelin' good yet? Oh, it gets better.But even if Forrest Gump IS depressing, that doesn't make it a bad movie. What makes it bad is, as I said before, the silliness. Sure, putting him in all those vintage newsreels is cute and even pretty cool to see. But the cuteness wears thin pretty soon, and is replaced by more ridiculous events in which Forrest inadverently alters NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICA, FOR THREE ENTIRE DECADES. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but not for me. For me, it makes the movie completely unbelievable, and what's more, stupid. This is not cute, and I certainly wasn't feeling good when I realized I'd wasted over two hours of my life listening to Forrest Gump's preposterous anecdotes.In the end, the movie's few saving graces--the good but predictable soundtrack (\"For What it's Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield in a Vietnam scene...great! Only 300 other movies before have done the exact same thing!), and the interesting effects with the newsreels--fail to rescue this bomb from the clutches of mediocrity. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can have Oscars coming out of their friggin' ears, for all I care...this movie will only ever amount to a 5 out of 10 in my book.",

    "reviewBody": "Three of the greatest films of all time came out in 1994: The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. Each were absolute masterpieces and I thoroughly enjoyed each of these movies. 'Forrest Gump' is one of the better drama films I've ever seen. The casting for this film was brilliant, as was the directing and writing. The script was brilliant and the acting was phenomenal, especially by Tom Hanks. This film, is very similar to 'Edward Scissorhands' in many ways and are the two greatest romance films I've ever seen. What I found interesting about this film is how everything is narrated by Tom Hanks' character, Forrest Gump, whilst sitting at a bus stop and telling his life story to other people. The fact that the end tells us that Forrest is waiting to catch a bus to meet Jenny, the love of his life, after all these years was great. The scenes where we realize that Jenny has a kid named Forrest Jr. and that he is the father was nicely done. When Jenny died, you can feel the emotion and feel such pity for Forrest as the chemistry between the two was good, the music was very quiet and most importantly, they were characters we felt connected to. The other two great chemistries were between Lieutenant Dan and Forrest as well as Buba and Forrest. The scene where Bubba dies was extremely sad as I would've loved to see him for longer. Pretty much a classic film!",

    "reviewTitle": "The Holy Fool",
    "reviewBody": "\"Forrest Gump\" was the \"big film\" of 1994, being both a huge commercial success and the winner of six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor for Tom Hanks. It tells the story of a man and his journey through life, and is told using a framework device in which the title character narrates his life-story to a succession of people seated next to him at a bus stop.Forrest is a young man from Alabama, probably born some time during the 1940s, although the timeline is rather confusing. He suffers from what would today be described as \"learning difficulties\", although his athletic abilities win him a place in college on a football scholarship. The film follows him though his college days and his time in the Army during the Vietnam War, where he is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in saving the lives of several members of his platoon.After leaving the Army, Forrest becomes a leading ping-pong player, playing against Chinese teams in \"ping-pong diplomacy\". (The sport is always referred to as \"ping-pong\" in the film, even though its players normally prefer \"table-tennis\"). He then goes into the shrimping business and, more by luck than judgement, ends up making a fortune, becoming head of the \"Bubba Gump Shrimp Company\", named after himself and an Army friend killed in the war. (In a curious example of reality imitating fiction, there now actually is a seafood restaurant chain of that name). On a whim, Forrest decides to go for a run, and ends up running for three and a half years, crossing America from coast to coast several times during that period.A feature of the film is its hero's meetings with the great and the good; he gets to meet three Presidents (Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon) and other celebrities such as Elvis Presley and John Lennon. These scenes were achieved not by using actors but rather by using special effects to insert images of Tom Hanks into old television and newsreel footage. One of its Oscars was for Best Visual Effects. Such effects seem to be a common feature of Zemeckis' films; others such as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\", \"Death Becomes Her\" and \"What Lies Beneath\" are also notable for creative use of CGI.Contrasting with Forrest's story is that of the great love of his life, his childhood sweetheart Jenny. Whereas he leads an essentially conservative lifestyle, she embraces the counterculture of the sixties, all radical politics, drugs and promiscuous sex. Eventually she marries Forrest while suffering from a mysterious virus (presumed to be HIV, but never named in the film as such), and dies shortly afterwards.This contrast has led to political controversy and to allegations that the film promotes conservative values. The conservative simpleton prospers, whereas the left-wing intellectual does not. The wages of radicalism are death. Certainly, the film takes the standard liberal line on issues such as racial integration and the Vietnam war, but by 1994 these issues lay two decades in the past. Culturally, its politics are much more conservative. Hanks's dictum that \"the film is non-political and thus non-judgemental\" has never convinced me. There is, for example, a lot of satire at the expense of the perceived hypocrisies of the hippie movement, such as Jenny's boyfriend who is against violence in Vietnam but not in his private life, regularly beating her up.\"Forrest Gump\" was one of the films in which Hanks, seen in the eighties primarily as a comedy star, managed to reinvent himself as a serious actor in the nineties, and brought him his the second of his two successive \"Best Actor\" Oscars. He is certainly good here, much better than he was in, say, \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" or \"A League of Their Own\", two earlier films in which he had tried to take on more serious roles. He plays Forrest as a sort of holy fool, a man whose simplicity allows his inner goodness and decency to shine through. The character became something of a cult hero, and some of his nuggets of cracker-barrel philosophy, such as \"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get\" have passed into popular culture. (In fact, most chocolate manufacturers provide a guide to their selections, so you always know exactly what you're gonna get, but we'll let that pass).The film itself is a reasonably good one, even if its morality as sometimes rather simplistic, using Forrest's holy fool persona as a means of commenting on the politics and culture of late 20th century America. Zemeckis manages the difficult feat of pulling off a delicate balancing act between comedy and tragedy without the resulting mixture ever seeming incongruous. Yet I have never regarded it as the best film of 1994, being merely a good film in a year which saw a number of very good, even great, ones such as \"The Shawshank Redemption\", \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", \"The Madness of King George\", \"La Reine Margot\" and \"Nell\" (which would have been my personal choice for \"Best Picture\"). Hanks' performance is good, but not as good as Nigel Hawthorne's in \"King George\". I suspect that the film's immense success may have been due less to its merits than to the way in which its perceived conservatism fitted the public mood in 1994, the year of the so-called Republican Revolution which saw the Republicans take control of both Houses of Congress. 7/10",

    "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump is a heart-breaking film of witt and startling grace. Another Oscar for Tom Hanks, who is unforgettable in his portrayal of Forrest Gump. He brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the South who finds strength in God, country, his childhood pal, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), and his great mother (Sally Field). When Forrest falls a few IQ points shy of minimal school requirements, his Mother knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. Her son has a gift. As Forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a Vietnam war hero, a world-class ping pong player, a shrimp tycoon and even a father.Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stick around him for long.\"Forrest Gump\" is an entertaining film of extreme importance. It completely reiterates the idea that no one should be prejudiced for being different. What a superb example of film-making! 9/10",

    "reviewTitle": "It Is Not Overrated.",
    "reviewBody": "I have a personal hatred for a kind of statement, very personal indeed: \"Forrest Gump is overrated.\" I never understood and I always found the people who say that very confusing. I read the reasons and reflected on them, but it didn't make sense. Okay, I agree that it is the third best among the three of 1994, is that it did not deserve to have won the Oscar for best film, etc. But if there's anything I find totally ridiculous, it's the people who say the movie is objectively horrible, which is really a bad movie. That, I never understood.Well, but this is a review, isn't it? So here we go: Forrest Gump is not just a movie, but it is a lesson in life, it is one of the best, of all time. Starting with the performances: What performances! Tom Hanks played a wonderful role in what is arguably his best film and his best performance. But not only is his acting real, but the character is what is remarkable. His ingenuity that conquers everyone just makes his return good, but the differences he makes in each person's life. And that is satisfying in a way that we want only good from Forrest Gump, and we see if a person is \"innocent and naive\" is definitely not a problem. The guy is so freaking badass that he taught Elvis Presley to dance, he was arguably the best football player in history, a war hero, rich, owner of a shrimp company, he changed people's lives, had a smart son and the damn for four ...The technical aspects of the film are good too, the cinematography of the film in general is not to be desired, the script is magnificent, but it has some flaws. And the way the film gets involved with a mixture of genres is quite unique.",

He is everything I wish I could be, the greatest man to ever walk to the Earth. The Dos Equis guy doesn't have anything on Forrest Gump. Forrest is the most interesting man in the world, just ask the people at that bus stop. I've seen the movie at least a dozen times and I still cry when his Momma dies, when Bubba dies, and when Jenny dies and he's at her grave talking about their son.

    "reviewTitle": "Life is Like a Box of Chocolates That You Totally Just Got for Free",
    "reviewBody": "\"Forrest Gump\" is a classic movie that everyone's seen a dozen times, and if you haven't you probably know all the quotes: You've heard \"Run, Forrest, run\" and \"Life is like a box of chocolates\" and so on, and you've heard impressions of Tom Hanks's slow Southern drawl in varying degrees of similitude and awfulness. The movie ambles charmingly along with its protagonist, following him from Alabama to Vietnam to a Louisiana shrimp boat, watching him meet presidents and celebrities, and regularly churning out life lessons. A charming, amiable sort of movie, if only those life lessons weren't so sickening.Forrest never does much of anything, but wonderful things just keep happening to him. His miraculous sprinting earns him a college football scholarship, and he meets John Kennedy after the championship game. He joins the army and goes off to the Vietnam War, where he wins the Medal of Honor. He becomes a wealthy shrimp-boat captain after surviving a hurricane, also rather miraculously. Everything just keeps getting better for him.Meanwhile, his single mother is stricken with cancer, and dies. His childhood friend Jenny, after struggling with drugs, gets AIDS and dies. His army friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam. His other friend, Lieutenant Dan, gets off easy by comparison, only losing his legs and spending much of the film in a wheelchair.The obvious and unequivocal message of all this is that it was good to be a straight white man in America in the second half of the twentieth century. The movie's two women both live hard lives and die young, as does Bubba, who is black. Lieutenant Dan is white, by the way.Forrest is oblivious to nearly everything. Good things are handed to him, like that box of chocolates or the Apple stock he just happened to come by. He even accidentally inspires the iconic yellow smiley face.Looking at it this way, it's less of a nostalgic trip down our collective memory lane and more of a scathing satire on the inequities of American society. Someone should tell the folks who keep posting this on their \"Best Conservative Movies\" lists.",

    "reviewTitle": "More of the same. Yawn!",
    "reviewBody": "Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.Chapter 2 set things up for a potentially entertaining part three, ending with John Wick (Keanu Reeves) on the run, hunted by the world's top assassins, all keen to collect the bounty on his head. This film should have been a whole lot of outrageously OTT comic-book fun, with an array of bizarre and unique killers, each with their own distinctive look and style; it certainly starts off on the right foot with a few of fun fight scenes (one against a tall guy in a library, another in a shop full of knives, and one in a stable that makes good use of the horses), but it all goes downhill rapidly after that.A pack of trained dogs easily outshine their human co-stars in one skirmish, a fight involving samurai swords and motorbikes blatantly borrows from The Villainess (2017), and a battle between Wick and Mark Dacascos in a glass room is frustratingly tedious (despite Dacascos's impressive martial arts skills). I blame director Chad Stahelski, who hasn't progressed as a film-maker since part one, content to simply give fans more of the same. The preposterous ending is the icing on the cake, John Wick surviving falling several stories from the roof of a building. Enough already!5/10, minus one point for the retro-technology used by the tattooed administrators working for the 'high table': Commodore 64 keyboards, green CRT monitors, rubber stamps, rotary dial phones.

    "reviewBody": "In the immediate lineage of the second opus, this new one should satisfy all the fans of the John Wick saga (I'm definitely one of them!) which can be considered as a huge video game, a kind of God of War (2005), with the audience within the movie theater as gamers. You may choose John Wick as Player 1 with an immortal cheat code or any other opponent as Player 2 without this cheat code. Although this new opus innovates with new weapons like horses, dogs, katanas and new horizons with Morocco, the recipe is, to put it simply, almost identical and always successful.I especially enjoyed the tribute to the legendary film Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) with the famous scene during which Tuco, a.k.a. The Ugly, elaborates a custom-made weapon by combining pieces from Remington, Colt, Smith & Wesson, ... and acoustically checks that the result lives up to his expectations, carefully listening to the sound of the barrel. Not to mention an unexpected reference to The Matrix (1999) via the quote « Guns, lots of guns! »But... one of the keys of a cinematographic success is a villain being up to the hero. In the first opus, Viggo Tarasov was of a rather imposing stature, i.e. the leader of the Russian underworld in New York, and interpreted by a charismatic and credible actor, Michael Nyqvist. In the second opus, Santino D'Antonio was an abject, perfidious and megalomaniac man which sees himself as the only representative of the Camorra with the ambition to sit on the High Table, whatever it takes. In this regard, Riccardo Scamarcio was awesome. In the third and last opus, it's almost a fiasco. Firstly, we do not really know who the big boss is. Secondly, there are a plethora of ridiculous underlings. The Adjudicator is an uptight and condescending woman (we almost want to give her slaps). Then Berrada is a wreck who shoots an innocuous dog without being able to kill it (my 5-year-old nephew would probably succeed, even with a water pistol). And finally, the Elder is a guy who drinks mint tea in the middle of the desert, surrounded by his dromedaries (no comment). Beyond this mess, Zero tries to save the day. In short, the villains are ultra-quantitative but insufficiently qualitative! We definitely need a Thanos, a T-1000, a Predator, ... figuratively speaking.As a synthesis: yyeeeeeesssss!

    "reviewBody": "John Wick, having killed someone within the sanctuary of the New York Continental Hotel, is on the run with a $14M bounty on his head. We learn more about the High Table as their Adjudicator seeks to sanction those who have helped Wick: meanwhile Wick battles his way through the many, many, many, many anonymous figures who seek to kill him.Keanu Reeves kicks off Chpater 3 exactly where Chaper 2 left off, racing his pigeon-toed way through the streets of New York not quite ahead of the entire population, all of whom seem to know who he is as they wait, heavily armed, on the next corner.I liked John Wick 1. I thought number 2 was empty nonsense, non-stop videogame violence in search of a story. And, regrettably, number 3 is more of the same. I've scrolled through IMDB comments, through masses of 9s and 10s all declaring this to be the best yet, and how much better it is than anything else in cinemas at the moment. OK, fair enough, opinions are like fundamental orifices, everyone's got one, and what comes out of them is the same for each of us.But to me, the reason why this film fails (not completely, there was at least a little bit of story about the nature of the High Table) is because none of the exquisitely choreographed slaughter means anything. There are several reasons for this:\n1. You can't hurt Wick. Stab him, run him over, throw him off a building - he just stands up, groans a bit, and carries on;\n2. The number and manner of combatants is unbelievable. Wherever he is, there is an endless procession of assailants waiting to take their places in the queue of imminent corpses, usually 2 at a time. Pop, pop, another 2.\n3. Assailants all have patented guaranteed to miss ammunition, Wick has patented guaranteed to hit ammunition. Yeah, right.\n4. Knowing that you can't hurt him and he can kill you means that there is nothing at stake when he fights you - the result is predetermined.\n5. The assailants are all faceless, anonymous bodies. They are not people, they are simply outlines in fairground tatget practice. There is no emotional significance to taking a life. These are not people, so who cares?Regrettably - because I like Keanu Reeves, this is empty-headed style over substance. No 9 or 10 from me, I'm afraid.",

The second one to me was eh because it got really silly with the whole \"high table\" and medallions and basically everyone in the world is a contract killer, etc. John Wick 3 is basically the second one, only on PCP.The entire 3rd film is literally like watching someone play a video game with god mode on. Nothing stops him. He gets stabbed in the neck, that's ok. Stitch it up, move on. People fire hundreds of rounds at him. It's ok, they all missed. He gets hit with two cars literally back to back. He just gets up. Hell, he gets shot point blank 5/6 times and falls out of a 4th or 5th story balcony, bounces off of everything and splats on the street, it's ok, he's still alive and just \"angry\" now. The entire movie is just and endless line of contract killers coming up to Wick and them fighting.Don't get me wrong, I love action movies and like I said, I loved the first one. Without a good story though, it's just silly. After about 45/50 minutes, you literally start shaking your head because it just becomes really repetitive. A friend of mine asked me how the movie was afterward. It can be summed up as \"everyone goes after Wick, everyone dies, the end.\" The movie is also left wide open for a sequel which just blew my mind. Just stop. The movie was the equivalent of someone who was playing GTA3 their first time, just running around and shooting and killing everything that moves.",

    "reviewBody": "The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!",

    "reviewBody": "John Wick is no longer a small start-up movie that caught our eye and re-energised the revenge genre. The producers of John Wick, with both eyes clearly on building a profitable franchise, have decided to do a Mission Impossible with The Syndicate and 007 with Spectre, and create a super organisation - The High Table. And with it (roll eyes moment) rules, regulations, protocol etc which are all becoming too often and too much these days.What this means is, we get an all out action-packed opening of 20-odd minutes before the show becomes a platform for product placements and poorly choreographed fight scenes where you can see Keanu 'acting' more than fighting and in fact, struggling to keep up (and not because he is injured or has been thrown about). The fight scenes, many shot wide angle, do not have the energy and intensity of the opening sequences and there are many, many moments where you feel 'oh come on, John's whole body is open for attack'. Laurence Fishburn, Angelica Houston and Halle Berry are wasted and don't even get me started on Asia Kate Dillon - she is annoying in Billions, even more so here. I am a big fan of the first John Wick, was ho-hum about the sequel but this third one, haiz...can't say I'm looking forward to a 4th instalment. There may be a High Table but there's nothing inviting on it.",

    "reviewBody": "I must not be in on the joke, since at this writing (May 2019) this movie has an 8.1 rating on IMDB, as well as a very high rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Not to give anything away, the entire movie seems to consist of John Wick killing uncountable numbers of baddies who are out to kill him because he broke the rules of some bizarre hotel for killers. There is not much of a story, except for Wick's trading on on past favors with ever-higher-ranking bad guys, and at each level having to kill a few dozen more baddies. There was virtually no humor or personal interest in Wick himself.Question: how do supposedly brilliant crime bosses manage to hire only underlings who cannot shoot or fight well enough to take out one injured, exhausted man? With all of them spraying machine gun bullets in Wick's direction, how come he never gets hit? Jeez, I'd even settle for a richochet.Best wishes to viewers who like that sort of thing, but I found it horribly boring and walked out about 2/3's of the way thru the film. If there is some big joke at the end, I can't reveal it because it was not worth my time to stay through the entirety of this awful movie to find out.",

After I watched the first John Wick movie I thought, yeah there was a lot of violence but it made since. Someone invades your home, steals your car and kills your dog you seek revenge. It was a great escape movie, violence with a plot. John Wick 2 was less successful for me, lots of violence, no plot. The best parts were minor ones, John and Santino's sister before she dies and John's professional courtesy to Common. In John Wick 3 I guess you could say there was a plot, but mostly there was stylized violence which just got boring. It would have been nice to have more plot concerning the workings of the High Table and a better adjudicator. This actress was a little boring. There is no doubt as I stated earlier the casting was great, Angelica Houston was a great addition. Finally meeting the head of the high table was also great but in total the movie was average.",

    "reviewBody": "I am happy for Mark Dacascos, ever since I first saw him fighting with (then against) his friend, Jason Momoa (and fellow Hawaiian) in \"Stargate Atlantis\". I know he worked hard to get where he is. He is a terrific stuntman and has a very high kick. Other than that small piece of observation, this is a pathetic film. It's all about money. If they have fun, that's great; however, this is a low-brow script. I love the variety of films Keanu Reeves has chosen in his career as an actor. This is (for me) as low as it gets. Take awat the action, and it is worthless; a big fat zero of a movie. It is great, if you're 13 years old. Chad Stahelski should truly stick to what he does best: Stunt choerography and coordination; otherwise, please do not direct any more of this pablum. Btw, it's funny to see Said Tagmaoui (a man 9 years younger than Keanu Reeves) call John Wick \"my son\". Too bad our friend Omar Sharif passed away, as he would have been so much better in that role (re: Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"Hidalgo\"). ZSave youre money, people. Theu should have quit after the first film, which had a mediocre script, but was fair to good (at best).",

And some of the assassins have the chance to kill John wick but don't take it because he's so famous it's an honour to fight him and then he kills them.

No would survive getting shot four times and falling down a roof like that. And yet less than 1 minute after he falls he is able to climb up and leave, let alone even be conscious? Come on. The action scenes were laughable and overdone. Not one main \"good\" character mortally wounded during an ambush? Definitely don't go into this movie with high expectations.

Makes zero sense (they had so many chances to kill off john wick but left him alive only so that wick could kill them instead) . Has no plot! Just fights and fights.

Unexpectedly continued the story in an interesting way. It expanded the whole \"assassin's underworld\" - they're every second person in NY - to ridiculous levels, but it was still pretty good. The plot didn't really get in the way of all the action.John Wick 3 - bloody hell. Why? Why?! What were they thinking?So yea, it continues the story, but in the most boneheaded way possible. John Wick is running - okay, cool. He has a marker?! Wow! I wonder if he'll use it to do something cool - no, he doesn't.The High Table sends an adjudicator and punishes those who assisted John? I wonder if they'll fight back - no, they don't.John Wick instead goes to the desert (where apparently - \"the Elder\" - the mysterious leader of the literally millions of assassins lives like some quasi-Egyptian/Arab Bedouin nomad king - does he have an internet connection out there?) and literally cuts his finger off to get a second chance to rejoin the assassin fraternity. Then when the characters he's sent to kill says \"Hey, don't kill me. Fight against the High Table\", John Wick says, \"Oh yeah, great idea.\" While he's standing there with his finger cut off... #$%& me - how stupid can they make this story?Like, literally, what the hell? The script is so completely retarded. It wrecks the whole film. It's all pointless - maybe that was the director's point?John Wick 2 set the film up so well, and #3 just sh#ts all over it. Absolutely hated it. 0 out of 10, but I gave it 2 in the hopes that they fire the director and hire better writers for #4.",

    "reviewBody": "The first film was a surprise box office hit, and naturally a sequel followed, which ended on a cliffhanger, I saw them both on DVD or online, this was going to be the first of the films I would see in the cinema, and I looked forward to it. Basically set an hour after the conclusion of the previous film, former hitman John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is now a marked man on the run in New York, he has been given one hour \"grace period\". After killing a crime lord of the High Table Santino D'Antonio, doing so unsanctioned in the New York City Continental, John has been declared \"excommunicado\", the bounty on his head stands at $14 million. Following the activation of the bounty, John reaches the New York Public Library and recovers a crucifix necklace and a \"marker\" medallion from cache hidden in a book. He fights his way through various assassins populating the city, until he reaches the Director (Anjelica Huston), a woman from his past, who accepts the crucifix as a \"ticket\" for safe passage to Casablanca, Morocco. The Director also brands Wick to signify that he has used up all his favours with her. Meanwhile, the Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) meets with Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the New York City Continental, and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a network of assassins. The adjudicator admonishes both for helping John Wick kill Santino D'Antonio, they are both are given seven days to give up their offices or face serious consequences. In Casablanca, John meets Sofia (Halle Berry), a former friend and the manager of the Casablanca Continental. He presents his marker and asks Sofia to honour it by helping him get to The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui), a high-ranking member of the High Table, so that he can get the bounty relinquished. Sofia takes him to assassin Berrada (Jerome Flynn), who tells John that he will find the Elder by wandering through the desert until he cannot walk any longer. Berrada asks for one of Sofia's dogs in exchange for this information, she refuses, he shoots the dog (it survives with a bullet proof jacket). In rage, Sofia shoots Berrada, she and John fight their way through the various henchmen, until they escape the casbah and flee into the desert. Having fulfilled her marker, Sofia leaves John in the desert, he roams until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found by The Elder's men, and meeting the man himself, John explains his actions, saying he is desperate to live and \"earn\" the memory of the love he had with his wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John, only if he assassinates Winston and works for the High Table until his death. To show his commitment, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to The Elder. Meanwhile, the adjudicator has recruited the assassin Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his \"students\" to find and kill John. With Zero's help, the Director and the Bowery King are accosted for their actions, both are maimed as penance, the Bowery King almost fatally. John arrives back in New York City and is pursued by Zero's men but reaches the Continental and takes sanctuary. Winston encourages John not to die as a killer but as a man who loved and was loved by his wife. The adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to give up his office, and John refuses to kill Winston. Consequently, the adjudicator \"deconsecrates\" the Continental, allowing killing in the building. Zero and his men are notified by the adjudicator, two busloads of body-armoured High Table enforcers arrive. With the help of the hotel's concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick), John defends the Continental from the enforcers, killing them with armour-piercing shotgun shells. John is then ambushed by Zero and his \"students\", he defeats and kills all but two of the \"students\", then kills Zero. The adjudicator negotiates in a discussion with Winston, he offers penance to the High Table. John arrives, the adjudicator identifies him as a threat to the negotiation, so Winston shoots John repeatedly, causing John to fall from the Continental's roof. The Continental returns to operation, but the adjudicator informs Winston that John's body has disappeared and that he remains a threat to them. A wounded John Wick is taken to the heavily scarred Bowery King, who is angry with the High Table and will be fighting against them, John agrees to join him. Also starring Jason Mantzoukas as Tick Tock Man, Randall Duk Kim as Doctor and Gotham's Robin Lord Taylor as Administrator. Reeves remains cool and focused as the former assassin that will not be messed with, the revenge element has disappeared, the antihero is simply fighting for survival, it does not feel quite as fresh as before, the fights are well choreographed, but a little repetitive, but the escalating body count, over-the-top deaths and violence still just about work, it is still a worthwhile action thriller sequel.

Something that didn't go quite well and that was the ending. When John wick got shot, fell down the building and went underground with Bowery king. It was kind of a disappointing ending. It felt like John wick ended up in the same place he was in the beginning of the movie, but now full of rage. I just don't think this was the way to end it. Of course the movie ended that way to give the audience high hopes for the next chapter but still. Way end a movie the same way it started more or less???. For me, that was the only flaw.

Keanu is on the run after being declared excommunicado for killing a member of the International Assassin's Guild on sacred protected ground-Ian's hotel-and he was given a one hour head start before the dogs are let loose. A $14 million dollar bounty is put on his head and anyone that helps him would be in trouble too, so almost everybody wants a piece of him. Halle plays an old friend of Keanu's-he helped her once before and she owes him a favor so he is wanting to collect it. Asia plays the Adjudicator-she enforces the rules and has hired help to make sure things run smoothly. Mark is one of those hired help. The fights are incredible. And I mean all kinds of fights; martial arts, guns, motorcycles....even horseback. For you sports fans, Keanu has a fight with NBA player Boban Marjanovic-he is 7 foot 3 inches tall-and it is amazing. FYI: Parabellum has two meanings. First, it is Latin for Prepare For War. Second, it is the name of a 9mm handgun cartridge. I have heard that this will be the last one in the John Wick series but it ends with a set up for #4-I don't know, I guess we will just have to wait and see. This one is definitely the best of the three.\nIt's rated \"R\" for strong violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.\nI loved this adrenaline rush and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray.",

    "reviewBody": "I very rarely write reviews but I'm quite disappointed. The first movie deserves the highest rating of the three so far and it was my personal favorite of the franchise. It was different and a refreshing take on a revenge movie and to be honest, I was skeptical from the very start that they made a third. The second was OK but not great either. Don't listen to these high ratings, listen to your average movie goer. The high ratings clearly comes from the movie industry. Should have been called John Wick Masscacre, my goodness. All that violence and for what? The first 20 minutes were great but it gets repetitive and boring and just plain stupid. If you love action that's ridiculous and aren't bothered by a weak plot then you'll like it but other than that. Just an OK movie, nothing fantastic. Oh and by the way, John Wick will bring down the High Table with ease it seems. He can fight like a gamer using cheats. Just awesome.",

I must admit I have fast-forwarded a few times during the action scenes as they were boring. The end of the movie is working its way to and creating an opening for John Wick 4. Also very unbelievable as in the final scene John drops from the top floor of a building hitting the fire staircase with his body and head and drops at least 15 metres from that point onto the pavement. Nobody can survive a fall like that, but when they start looking for the body it's gone.",

    "reviewTitle": "This film is so stupid I just started laughing at the silliness",
    "reviewBody": "I'd rated the first two at 6/10 - decent action films that had some sort of story thread. That was abandoned this time round. Think of those horror films which don't amount to anything more than 1001 different ways to kill someone as gruesomely as possible. After a while it just became tedious, with a few over the top moments for the sadists in our midst - do we really need to see a knife slowly being forced into and through a person's eye and into their brain (with no more motive to hate the guy than him being one of the multitude of assassins trying to kill the hero)? As for the imperviousness of the hero, it's no good showing him being stabbed, shot and beaten up if the result is that he just keeps going and never gets hit by a bullet from someone (multiple supposedly highly trained assassins) simply standing back and taking him out. Instead they all dutifully cue up to have a go at him, with one arm, then the other, then a foot...\nThe film's effort to portray some kind of code of honour was also absurd, given the flexibility that saw it all boiled down to 'kill or be killed'.\nHalle Berry gives us the only decent scene, when she goes into full warrior mode because a guy ruthlessly killed her dog (tho' we later see both dogs in action during the escape - evidently it was as bullet-proof as the hero). If there has to be a JW4 - and everything was set up for yet another sequel - at least bring her back to lend a bit of class to the proceedings.",

    "reviewTitle": "A masterclass in action movie making!",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 ParabellumSo the easiest way to sum up JW3 is that if like me you enjoyed the first two instalments then this third outing for Baba Yaga will be right up your street.\nThe plot is thin and simple.\nJohn is on the run from every hitman and assassin on the planet and he must come up with some rather creative ways in which to stay alive.JW3 is a masterclass in action movie making.\nI truly believe stuntmen and women should get Oscars.\nThe work gone into making this sequel is groundbreaking in terms of practical stunts and effects.\nThere also should be a category for best performance in an action role. In which Keanu Reeves would win hands down.\nIn my review for JW2 I said the film left me fatigued with too much repetition.\nOnly after buying the Blu-ray of that movie did I truly appreciate it.\nJW3 on the other hand isn't repetitive in terms of the action sequences.\nThere's some real creativity gone into developing every action scene.\nInventive and impressive are words that can be used to describe each set piece.\nThe opening fight sequence involving a rather tall gentleman and a book sets the tone.\nThen we are treated to knife fights. Fights on horseback, Fights on motorcycles,Fights with guns. Lots of guns!\nOh and there's Halle Berry's attack dogs which are awesome!\nSpeaking of Miss Berry. She's fantastic and really sells her action scenes.\nSadly though she's a little under-utilised. Her part isn't as big as the trailers would have you believe.\nThere's strong support from 90's straight to video star Mark Dacascos.\nIt was nice to see him again. He's an accomplished martial artist who never really got the recognition he deserved during his heyday.JW3 is going to be a fine looking movie when it makes its way on to 4K Blu-ray. I believe the HDR in this film will look sublime.\nThe film projected well in the theatre and often cinema screens can look a tad murky.\nIn terms of sound design this film sounded amazing.\nThe final shoot out was truly spectacular.\nEach different gun having its own signature sound.\nBass was really punchy.\nEvery punch, kick and cracking bone could be heard to earsplitting effect.In terms of plot and storytelling this is where the film stumbles a little. My score for this movie kept fluctuating due to the convoluted plot.\nI think the scriptwriters have tried to build a franchise out of the first films simple premise and it is always apparent that it seems forced.\nA minor gripe because in terms of the action genre all the John Wick movies must be regarded as all time greats.\nThe JW franchise will become classics of the genre unlike the tripe certain over the hill action stars churn out. (I'll name no names but a fat guy with a goatee and a ponytail springs to mind).\nJW will be a classic because they're inventive, well shot and expertly made.\nEvery punch, kick and shot to the head can be seen.\nThere's no shaky-cam. No choppy editing hiding the fact that the actors can't do the business.\nThe audience are treated to a visual chaotic feast of violence.\nIf indeed this type of thing is up your street then JW3 is going to be one for your Blu-ray collection.\nA film that if judged solely on its action set pieces then it's the best of the three.\nHowever overall as a movie we the audience aren't emotionally connected to JW3 as we were with the first film.\nIt has a over convoluted plot that expands on the second films flaws.\nStill I'm up for John Wick: Chapter 4, I'll be there opening night.",

The character's motivations were relatable and the action was clever and often original.\nThe sequels have both been huge disappointments, seemingly made by people with only a passing knowledge of the first movie.\nIn John Wick it's established that he is a master assassin able to slip in and out without detection. A ghost. It also establishes he is a stickler for the rules.\nJohn Wick 2 kicks off with John doing something he doesn't want to do becasue someone takes advantage of his respect for the rules. Not only does the movie later contradict that respect, but his execution of the contract is incredibly sloppy, walking directly through the party so everyone can recognize him.\nThis movie is ridiculous. They've turned John into a superhuman who can survive stabbings, gun shots, punches, and falling off a tall building while hitting every obstacle possible on the way down. Worse, it's also mean-spirited and incredibly repetitive, devolving into a tiresome exercise in \"How can we kill the next guy creatively?\". How am I supposed to root for a guy who broke the rules and ends up murdering dozens of people who are faithfully attempting to collect on a legitimate contract? The Adjudicator wasn't the antagonist here nor were any of the other assassins. John Wick is the antagonist.",

    "reviewTitle": "How to make shooting boring",
    "reviewBody": "I will start this off by saying that I did enjoy the first film and sure, the second movie wasn't for me, I get why people could enjoy it. But with this third installment? Firstly, this movie is about an hour and 50 minutes of action scenes in which yes, we get some admittedly good action scenes here and there, but quickly, it gets dull. Be it from watching the many assassins go after John Wick (who also gets about 6 lines the whole movie so yay.) in similar manner to the last film, to shootouts with Halle Berry and genital hungry dogs (its cool the first couple of times but seeing it back to back for nearly 10 minutes makes the sight lose any impact and luster) that last just far too long. Also, the action gets absurdly comical (not just with the dogs, but also with horses kicking people to death) and hey, that's cool in a Fast and Furious film because they know that they are big dumb action movies, but this film series was trying to be something smarter, something deeper, but evidently that is no longer the case especially if you pay attention to what little dialogue is here. This movie really wants to pretend that it is saying something profound, or the characters are doing anything that isn't obviously evil (Ian McShane is doing something duplicitous? Perish the thought!) but instead, it comes off like a 12 year old wrote this movie. Also, this world is beginning to make less and less sense the more the attempt to add to it, and the more they add to John Wick's backstory (hey, he's Belorussian! Does this matter? No.) it makes it feel like they are making things up as they go to try and justify having John Wick be Superman without the ability to fly. Look, I love action but by this point in the series, its hard to care about what is happening or feel like this movie isn't simply spinning its wheels in terms of actual story telling or meaningful action that can actual excite. I fully expect the next movie to have John Wick have a fistfight on top of a plane with three shark ninjas who stole his wife's body who is actually still alive and trying to destroy the world with a techno-organic computer virus. This movie is that stupid.",

    "reviewBody": "Of the first John Wick movie, I said it was \"Mindless, enjoyable action\". I didn't review the second, which is usually an indicator that it was neither good nor bad. John Wick 3, however, to borrow the Spinal Tap meme \"Turns it up to 11\". But not in a good way.The action is too prolonged at every turn. Gone is the John Wick of the first movie - an efficient, ruthless killer, that despatches his victims quickly and without fuss. Here is the John Wick that ignores openings for killing blows, takes far too long over fights and seems himself to be tired of it all.Not, I stress, an aging, battered Wick that is slowing down and past his prime. That might have been interesting. No, this is a John Wick hampered by a script with too little plot and which has had scrawled over it with great liberalness the phrase \"Insert pointless action scene here\".Gone is \"Mindless, enjoyable action\" and hello to \"Mindless, tiresome action\".Now, having said the action is, essentially, boring, that is not to say it isn't well done. But it is a little too slapstick, with far too many people being thrown through far too many windows. Fights go on endlessly with none of the protagonists really showing any signs of fatigue, or really suffering any ill-effects from any wounds/injuries suffered until the killing blow.It's as if Michael Bay directed it, shouting \"More shattering windows!\" and \"Keep going! More fighting!\" all the time.What little plot there is could have been neatly packaged into about sixty minutes including action scenes (that were not dragged out).In addition, there was a strange lack of attention to detail in some scenes. People are murdered in a subway in front of hundreds of witnesses whom all fail to react in any way. Said bodies then disappear from one shot to the next. In some scenes, blood is spattered about liberally, whilst in others any amount of sword and stabbing action draws no obvious blood-letting. There is a risible amount of knife-throwing in one scene, which was beyond ridiculous, with blades going back and forth and seemingly not having much effect when they struck home. All in all, each and every fight sequence was just too long and too tedious.I can't, in all honesty, recommend this, even if you enjoyed the first two Wick movies. What's worse, it leaves the opening at the end to vomit up another installment. I only hope if they do regurgitate another one, that they actually get someone competent in to write an actual script, rather than whoever was responsible for this mess.SUMMARY: John Wick... finally gets on your wick. Dull fight scenes go on longer than War and Peace. Be afraid, be very afraid... of an extended edition.",

Its psychedelic cinematography and mise en scene is what makes this franchise stand out from other action films, and it also cements Reeves as one of the most iconic screen presences there is working in cinema today.He says very little in the film, but action speaks louder than words, and my goodness, what sublime action there is in this beautiful film.Picking up straight from JW2, Parabellum is an almost exhausting exercise in action, and you have to empathise with Wick, he rarely has a chance to rest during the film, and the physical and psychological damage he suffers only adds to the films tension.Part 3 ups the ante with the set pieces, from the small intimate ones in a library, to the grand extended almost balletic extended shootouts in the second and third act, John Wick never fails to amaze the viewer, but with all this action, when we stop to breathe, especially when we have exposition starring Berry and Huston, the film really does stop in a jarring way.Camerawork is wonderful, particularly when we are on the road, with the camera focusing on the long road, subliminally referencing Wicks never ending journey, just when will it all be over? How will this man ever rest? Will Wick ever get to the end of his journey, his goal to carry on living, so he can remember?It's also great to see Dacascos starring in a major release again, his Zero is a formidable adversary, but his strange, almost camp like ways make him a very likeable presence, causing the viewer to let their guard down, and endear to him, making him one of the most dangerous villains.It's a wonderfully crafted film, almost dreamlike in its nature, the desert scene is awe-inspiring and a genuine jaw dropping moment, that lets you almost feel the delusional state Wick must be feeling as he slowly dehydrates.It's also very funny in places, with Macshane providing the biggest laugh by simply putting a phone down.So all in all, it's a wonderful sequel, thanks to Reeves hypnotic presence, the amazing choreography, and some wonderful camerawork.One cannot wait to see how the next film will top this.",

How many times can you see John break someone's hand, throw them to the ground and shoot them in the head before you get tired of seeing it?Later on in the movie, I swear the fight scenes look slow, and the hits feel like they have no force behind it. You stop being worried for John, because he shrugs a hit off every minute. You know what I started thinking of while watching this movie? Cartoons and old Chinese kung-fu movies where every attack is telegraphed a week in advance. The movie has officially abandoned the \"secret society of assassins\" theme they were going for. In multiple scenes, people are killed in public, and no one in a crowded place reacts. The fight scenes with the dogs, arguably the best scenes, look incredibly fake. When people stop moving for the dogs to attack them, it just starts looking comical. It's cool, but you never buy it.John Wick 3 wasted a perfectly good actor, Keanu, to keep on increasing the senseless kill count. It's not impressive anymore.The whole 2nd and 3rd act was nullified by the ending.John wants to continue living and looks for a chance to be forgiven. When you make us watch John spend an hour of the movie looking for someone, find him, get what he wants, only to throw that away in the next 5 minutes, it feels like a bad plot.When you make us watch Halle tell John multiple times that helping him is dangerous for her safety, and that one mistake can get her killed, start killing people of the organization while she could have walked away, only for a dog killing punchline, it starts looking like a bad plot.When you make us watch Winston refuse to step down, refuse to kill John, arm John, and then shoot John after some senseless killing, which he could have done just as well when John came to the glass room and turned his back to Winston, it feels like a bad plot.That scene where John falls from the roof of a building to the ground, and survives, they might as well have given him superpowers.I started wanting for it to end, because I felt I have seen enough of this franchise, only to be very disappointed by the sequel bait. They are becoming the new Terminator. It should have ended on the second, but we will get 3 more.",

I mean killing a giant with a book and having a horse kick two of the guys is insane!\nI love how we are slowly getting more background on who John Wick is (like his real name).\nMy only flak on this movie is how the bad guys keep letting John get away. When John was escaping on the horse, the bad guys on the motorcycle was riding alongside him but insist on using a sword to kill him only to have John steal their gun and shoot all of them. They could've just unloaded on him.\nOverall, this was a great action packed movie with beautiful cinematography and of course the fighting and shooting scenes were great as always. I was sure that is would be the final movie in the series but with that ending, there needs to be more.",

    "reviewBody": "Parabellum fails to develop a strong storyline.If High Table is so respected in the assassins universe, it wouldn't be so easily dismantle by Wick. It doesn't make any sense to follow all the codes if you can challenge it. The adjudicator placed a 7-day notice before executing penalties and giving people options, that feels weird, because John Wick story before this is all about the immediate and clear consequence. If you do this, you'll get that.Parabellum expanded the Wick's World to the East, which opens a very interesting possibilities to play with. However, it struggles to make it natural. Kill Bill has set the bar for western fighting movies very high, making Parabellum fight scenes with the Asians assains look like Fast and Fury.The fight scenes also showed a classic problem that has been solved long ago, and can be seen in so many Jacky Chan's movies, Matrix series even has solved this too. People don't brawl in order, one enemy by one enemy, the come altogether towards the target.I can appreciate the addition of some new characters. Not all of them are strong. Halle Berry and Anjelica Houston are strong ones. And especially the fighting DOGS!!! The not-so-Japanese Japanese character, played by Marc Dacascos, is weak.I hope the next sequel can compensate this one. 6/10 for this lazy sequel.",

It was fun in the beginning but after a while it just got boring and fast forward became my friend. I skipped over a lot of the fight scenes just to get to the end and see what happens since after 3 movies I had invested a bit and was rooting for John - but of course there was a cliffhanger.

    "reviewTitle": "Welcome to the John Wick/the Matrix/Hellboy cinematic multi-verse",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the newest action-comedy from the Matrix stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski. The movie is starring Neo, Morpheus and the Keymaker from the Matrix, Morticia Addams from the Addams Family and Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm from Hellboy. And you thought John Wick 2 was getting silly.The script is a mess of random actions and occurrences that don't lead to anything, really. This had to be an inside joke since they emphasize the word \"consequences\" multiple times in this film. The story just writes itself where it needs to be. Lots of different locations and racial stereotyping are just there for color, not connected to anything. The movie sometimes spills out half-baked philosophy or random Latin adage with a straight face, thinking that it is in fact - very smart.John Wick has even less character in this. I have no idea what he is supposed to be at this point in the franchise. They give some vague hints on his past, giving him a silly-sounding name and a Belarussian childhood or something (which was hilarious since I live in Ukraine, near Belarus). Throughout the movie, JW has like 10-20 lines of dialogue. He never does anything besides killing people violently and his moral choices make no sense. He takes an oath only to immediately abandon it, making the first hour of the movie essentially pointless. But this doesn't mean anything anyway since the ending fixes itself. And as it turns out, nobody really cared about John Wick in the first place. This may sound like a joke, but in fact, the development he has received in the first film is all we get for this trilogy.Judging the movie as a full experience is not that easy though. It has some good professional stuns (yet if you pay close attention you can spot some clues and pauses in the fight scenes, like someone waiting for his part and more). While I do prefer The Raid brawls to John Wick ones, I can appreciate the absence of shaky cam, actual long takes, and good visibility during the fights in JW3. The shooting parts were mostly ok, nothing that creative though. I loved some of the new ideas they've used, like adding dogs to the mix. There are some very good scenes with a decent flow of action. Action-wise, my only problem was that it was sort of becoming a little boring as the movie went on. I think this happened because JW himself is boring and immortal, you can never care about him since you know nothing bad can happen to him. Bike chases, horse chases, yea, this was getting a little repeatable. This could've worked better if they would've used real blanks instead of CGI blood and muzzle flashes. I was also surprised to see Mark Dacascos in good shape. He did some good stunts as well at his age. His character is trash, though.So, by the time I was getting tired of the action pieces I had nothing to grab on. Nothing to interest me in this film besides stupidity and low level misplaced humor. Everybody just became straight out of video-game characters. We now have enemy waves, NPC crowds that never reacts to people getting killed around them, bullet-sponge enemies, and mission status updates.I got a little confused with the references in this, though. John Wick directly referencing his line in the Matrix \"Guns, lots of guns\", Winston mentions Baba Yaga, a Russian folk-tale character out of the new Hellboy, in which Winston plays Prof. Broom. All these bizarre casting decisions, having Mark Dacascos as a Japanese man...I mean, I don't even know anymore.Overall good stuff in this: nice stuns (yet slowly becoming boring), good cinematography, nice color correction and shots composition (dark red and blue gritty film).Could've been better if they would've made this darker, had less kills, make JW vulnerable, explore his hurt inside, play around gun and assassination philosophy and add more visual style to this. It's harder and harder to enjoy JW movies just cause how blown up they've become.What if feels like is a movie written by a 15 y.o. action movie fan, or a 35 y.o. dude who was a 15 y.o. action movie fan in the 90s, but never grew up.",

Sofia owes Wick a certain debt.The action was so nonstop, that you lost track of who, where and how. It is bland, and banal. It is so Hollywood, in 2019.

    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the first two John Wick movies, the first a bit more than the second. They weren't on the same level as say the Bourne movies but they were ok. So I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately it failed to maintain even the so-so quality of the first two.First of all, one absurd plot twist is followed by another and then another. Actions are explained by; \"well he had a marker, I had no choice\". \"Markers don't matter to The Table!, I'm afraid you'll have to die\"....then why the f%$ck does anyone have markers and use them or honor them then if in the end they have no significance??Then; John Wick cashed in his \"ticket\". But all it get's him is one small favor and then he \"can't go home again.\" So what good is the frigging ticket in the first place??Then; John Wick uses one of his \"markers\" which again, will probably get the character he has it on killed and that begs the question once again, why would anyone use an effing marker!!! And he uses it to learn how to solve his problem which it turns out is by walking into the desert to ask for redemption which he's given if he chooses to agree to a certain deal, and oh yeah, cut off his finger and give up his wedding ring. The he goes back to NYC and immediately decides that he's not going to honor the deal after all, thus negating his redemption! Then why use a marker, thus putting another person life in danger, have to kill a whole bunch of people...again, risk death by walking out into the desert, agree to a deal and to cutting off your finger, if the next frigging day you're going to decide to just toss the entire deal anyway and end up still being hunted??? What exactly was the point to even seeking the deal in the first place...or in that entire plot line??Then; the manager of the Continental Hotel is in trouble because he helped John Wick. So he swears to fight along side Wick and his hotel desk clerk against the people that want them both dead. After dozens are killed and his hotel trashed in yet another cartoonish action sequence he says wait, never mind, and reneges on his promise to Wick....something he could have done a frigging hour earlier and avoided losing half his staff, not to mention all the dead bodies cluttering up his hotel!The point here is that the plot had no point. Characters followed one set of rules until it didn't work for the plot and those rules were tossed for a brand new set, and then that didn't work so they completely change direction again. There was no logic or coherent thought to the story, none of the characters actions made any sense. The plot was just a poorly written vehicle to allow everyone to fight with each other for two hours.And that brings up another point; there were so many fight scenes that after a while they all just looked the same. It actually got boring. And let's just overlook the fact that John Wick should have been dead a dozen times over from being hit by cars...or falling off of buildings...or being shot...or stabbed, or beaten to a pulp. It's like playing a video game with endless lives, no matter what happens the main character never dies. After a while you can't help but realize that it's not that John Wick is that much of a badass because he's constantly getting his ass kicked, it's that he's the main character so he just can't die....not matter what. And that's boring too because no matter what happens he's going to get through it. Kind of kills any suspense for the viewer. Part four is due out next spring and I think I'll pass because I'm sure I've already seen it all already in the first three movies.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Film Nudist reviews: John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum",
    "reviewBody": "\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is an interesting flick. Filled with gorgeously choreographed and badass action, John Wick 3 has one of the strongest opening sequences I've seen in any action movie. The opening 25 minutes features some of the most visually stunning, hardcore action scenes I've ever seen. Someone gets a book shoved into their mouth and their jaw broken with it, a man gets stabbed in the eye and the camera does not shy away, and of course, there's a shooting or two packed in there. The tension is high, the suspense is palpable, and the action is incredible. With no shaky camera and no quick cuts, everything is shown clearly in all it's visceral brutality; one part in particular was so brutal that everyone in my theatre collectively groaned. But unfortunately, when you open a movie that ridiculously strong, everything that follows seems to pale in comparison.There's no way around this so I'll just say it: after while, John Wick 3 gets boring. There are only so many times you can see someone get shot in the head before it starts to get stale, and John Wick 3 gets stale quick with overly drawn out action sequences and a middling second act that by the end feels pointless for ever happening in the first place. Don't get me wrong, the action is better than any action film released this year; you haven't seen action this slick and clean since \"John Wick 2.\" But because of how fantastic the first 25 minutes were, the rest of the action just doesn't seem as fun to watch.And like I mentioned, the middle of this movie is simply boring. I won't spoil much, but it involves John Wick traveling through the desert. It's not only boring to watch, but the overall effect it has on the story is pretty much pointless by the end, and on top of that, John's goal doesn't seem to make any sense or even matter by the time the movie ends.That being said, Keanu Reeves (or as he's called in the pick up community, Kino Reeves) is good, as always. Him as John Wick is riveting to watch. He's always a badass and a force to be reckoned with, and that's no exception here, even though he is tired and worn down from the events of the previous films. But this adds a new layer to the action. He's no longer as strong and no longer as efficient. In this film he gets beaten, and beaten badly, and I enjoyed watching this seemingly invincible character being pushed to his limit. Where in the previous movies he's so efficient that he knew he'd be able to kill all his enemies with little to no effort, in this movie he's so tired and broken down that it's obvious he's putting his all into trying not to die. And that was exciting viewing. The world building, too, continues to be enthralling. This world of underground assassins that's been built up since the first movie is so interesting to watch, and I wouldn't be surprised if something like that actually exists in real life. You also get to see a lot more of the Continental hotel, which was a very welcome addition.\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is by no stretch of the imagination a bad movie. The action, world building, fight choreography, cinematography, directing, and acting are all very well done. You won't see a better action movie this year, that's for sure. But, and I can't believe I'm saying this, there was just a little too much action, and a too little story. And this formula worked for the first two films, but they really need to switch up their act if they want to keep these movies fresh.6/10",

But, shouldn't there be something else? like, for example, a story? I will summarize the film: John is hunted by his employees and he runs from them, killing everything on his way. That's it. That's the whole movie.\nFX are good, action scenes are good, performances are average and, unlike previous John Wick movies, in this chapter, you have no feeling for the character. they lost all depth or sense of reality. They are all killing machines without sense, brain or feelings. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.\nChoreography is good but so repetitive. Every fight John Wick plays the same moves over and over. It looks like judo students practicing.\nIt seems the creators of the movie just ran out of ideas to kill people. The only scene that seemed a bit different was the Casablanca scene, where they had the great idea of adding killer dogs. Why not? in the next one maybe there will be killer cats or murdering flying sharks. Nothing makes sense any way. That scene though, was SO FAKE. My wife explained it perfectly: it seemed like a show from Universal Studios. With stunts dropping onto mattresses or boxes.\nIn general the movie is boring with no story to keep you interested.\nAvoid at all cost.",

    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is so far the best John Wick installment since the first one back in 2014. Movie franchises have been known to have terrible 3rd installments, but it seems that John Wick is an exception. The John Wick movies have been consistently getting better, and this series still has a lot of potential.The biggest problem that I had with John Wick: Chapter 2 was how it lacked in innovation. It was exactly like the first, and it barely built upon this universe. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum doesn't suffer this problem. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum adds so much more to this world in the best ways possible. This movie feels so much more fresh than the second movie, and I couldn't image how awful it would've been if it was exactly like the last two.I like how in all the sequels, they always start from when the last one ended. So it's always best to watch the previous movie in order to get a good understanding of what's happening in the current one. What's so great about this franchise is that it started small, then built an A-list cast. Keanu Reeves, Ian McShane, Halle Berry, and Laurence Fishburne. With every new movie, they add more talent. And on a side note, they set up the sequel so perfectly in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.What isn't a surprise is that John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum has great action and fighting scenes. The camerawork and directing is obviously very well professionally done. And Keanu himself proves once again that he was perfect for this role.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is yet another great installment in this amazing series. With every new movie, I always find myself being entertained like no other action movie. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a sure recommend for me.",

Keanu reeves is perfect for this role and we are transported in this escape, and an open ending gives us hope for the fourth chapter.",

    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the last two in a kind of \"guilty pleasure\" way, but man this is tedious. There is no plot as such, just a preposterous story line that basically leads to 120 minutes plus of killing after killing after killing. I'm not sure if it's meant to be funny? But often the the violence is so Tom and Jerry that it's hilarious. One scene in particular involving glass cases is hysterically funny. The acting is non existent - not that any is required of the \"script\" I have to say. Every other person on the planet appears to be some kind of super assassin ( not as super as Keanu obviously) and their leader lives in the desert a million miles from anywhere, although someone does actually give Keanu directions!!! I kid you not. Whoever thought an \"all action\" movie could be so stunningly boring. I'll give you 20 mins before you're looking round the room wondering if you should decorate soon.",

It starts of great with great and dynamic fight choreography, but it slowly looses steam as the writers try to inject story where there shouldn't be any. Clearly, this series' main selling point was the simple cause and effect story driven by the amazing Keanu Reeves, the great supporting cast and the juicy action packed scenes.Every new character seems out of place, boring, thin and pointless. Hale Berry? Really? Of all the amazing female actresses out there, they chose her? She clearly didn't have the mood or interest to act for this movies. Also, John apparently suffers from amnesia since he now, for some reason, wants back into the assassins' world? And the one supreme dude lives in the Morocco dessert? How? Why?By the end, I just waited for the credits because I couldn't endure another brainless decision made by some key player who suddenly decided to switch 180 wihtout a clear motivation or end goal.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is probably a good 70% actions, and 30% story. There is literally at least 80 minutes to straight up action if you were to cut up all the action scenes. Most of the action is great, especially a scene where John Wick beats a guy to death with a big book, and does a Mortal Kombat-like fatality on the guy using a book, as well as an amazing knife throwing fight scene. The final big shootout is pretty cool and funny, and the Halle Berry action scene is also pretty badass, with a lot of long single takes.The big final fight with these 3 badass ninja assassins was cool, but it went on a little bit too long. I mean, how many times do we have to see them kick John Wick through glass? It went on a little bit too long, but it is still pretty cool.There are some pretty funny comedic scenes in this movie, and John Wick doesn't really say much besides \"yes,\" and \"go.\"Anyways, if you want to see a horse kick a man's head backwards then go watch John Wick 3!",

Wow.Ask anyone who has seen this movie if what I am about to say is true.**SPOILER ALERT**\nWick gets ambushed by 2 (yes TWO) cars. By ambushed I mean in the true sense of the word. A planned surprise attack by villains in 2 cars AFTER he has already had a long fight with countless people. He'd already be tired but no. He exits a building onto the street and gets run over TWICE!!! Then gets up, starts running & is fit to fight again. GTFOH! I paid to watch a MOVIE not a fxxking senseless CARTOON!

Loved the winks to The Matrix (in both lines and casting Fishburne) and I loved how there was a little bit of comedy in way of \"Zero\" acting like a fanboy. Dacascos was simply amazing as \"Zero\", but I was sad to see the end of him. Soundtrack wasn't as good as the previous but still, few watch this franchise for the music.

    "reviewBody": "Utterly ridiculous but worse than that completely tedious. Essentially 2 hours of rolling fight scenes bracketing a threadbare plot that made no sense even in John Wick world. You could point to Indonesian & Hong Kong martial arts/action films and say what's the difference? Well they do actually have plot lines that work, there is a believable warrior code and the choreography is tight. The majority of the choreography in this is plain sloppy and the fight scenes go on for way too long, the only one that was vaguely watchable was the Halle Berry and the attack dogs and it was still too long. But what about the characters? There are no characters. Wick himself has become a caricature of a caricature, the chief villain (based in a C19TH desert nomadic camp!) Is laughable, the chief instrument of the villain is simply wooden, the indestructible ninja killers is trope we have seen too many times and is frankly racist, McShane & Fishburne are clearly just along for the pay cheque adding nothing of value and the host of incompetent assassins is cringeworthy. Which brings us to the core problem, for an international assassination bureau this organisation is both completely dysfunction and utterly incompetent, even by the standards of the franchise it just doesn't work but the star and the producers are perfectly happy insulting audiences with this drivel.\nOne final point, with so many bodies piling up, and boy do they pile up, you never hear a police siren, never see a policeman; in one utterly stupid scene Wick savagely slices up one of the unbeatable ninjas in Grand Central and nothing happens, literally nothing! Crowds of commuters just walk pass! It was almost like they took stock footage and just superimposed it. Insulting film making.\nDon't watch.",

    "reviewBody": "The best way I can describe the production of the John Wick films is slick. Everything from the direction, camerawork, fight choreography, set design, music and lighting is superbly polished, making it gorgeous to watch. John Wick: Chapter 3 carries this on very effectively.It's just glorious action cinema from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is just a living legend at this point with how he commits fully to the role. Stahelski also rightly gets much praise for how he handles the fight sequences with such grace.Somehow the action has managed to keep on improving from the first instalment, and the brutality is also upped as well, which I didn't think would be possible after what was delivered in Chapter 2.The additions to the cast are also pretty good. Halle Berry is solid, although her character is not involved nearly as much as I thought she was going to be. Mark Dacascos was also great as Zero, who was a worthy foe for John to take on in hand-to-hand combat. The introduction of Asia Kate Dillon as the Adjudicator was also intriguing, as it gave us our first glimpse of the mysterious High Table, which undoubtedly will be explored in further films.Also the world-building is once again on-point, slowly revealing morsels of information about the society of assassins. However, this is also the film's greatest weakness as it expands the world so much that what story there is becomes unfocused.I adore these films, and whilst this is certainly the weakest of the three, it's still a highly-engaging piece. I can't wait to see what they do next, as the prospect of John teaming up with the Bowery King to take on the High Table sounds great in concept.",

So the Russians are actually Belarusian Gypsies? But nothing aside from the main boss women's clothing indicates they are Gypsies. What gypsies are obsessed with ballet and stuff. It just felt very wrong. It would have made more sense if they had some sort of trailer park / tent and or their base was a circus. Bit more stereotypical, but just strange to me that they made him Roma. Roma are mostly involved in minor crime like pickpocketing and prostitution they aren't an ultra organized gang that control Russian mob and create super assassins.They try to be so PC but the manager of the Moroccan intercontinental is an African American female? And the other big guy in Morroco (boss of the mint) is this European white dude? I mean... why not use Moroccans or at least Arabs/Berbers.And leaders of the table are some Arab bedouins? What? ... I mean seriously, what?! Why? Why didn't John just kill them right then and there? From what I saw they had zero protection kt was just a tent caravan with a bunch if colorfully dressed Bedouins.There is this scene where they are fighting and John puts a book infront of the villains head and hits the..book? That was dumb. Cool that he used the book to break his jaw and neck moments later but that first part was bad choreography.\nAlso there was this part where they were fighting amid stone vats filled with \"molten gold\". It was in the Moroccan mint where they made the golden assassin coins. The molten gold literally looked like liquid gold. That's not how molten metal looks. It should have been bright white/orange.\nMerhaba means \"welcome\" not \"welcome back\"And I don't understand why he didn't cut his finger like the yakuza, like the top.of it. He removed almost all of the finger weakening his hand tremendously",

He repledges his fealty by sacrificing a finger, his engagement ring from his dead fiancee, and by taking the job of killing an old friend Winston.\nWhen he meets the old friend, the old friend makes John change his fealty again, fighting for him against the order of assassins.\nAfter wick kills a lot of assassins, the order of assassins renegotiate with Winston. He will stay in power, but wick must die. Wick jumps from a building to escape.\nHe's rescued and taken to another old friend who is instituting another criminal power structure in the underground. They join forces. The end. Which means there'll be a john wick 4.My opinion:\nHow people don't get bored by so many stupid fights is beyond me: 1) There's a reason we don't fight with fists, swords or axes anymore: guns are better. 2) If you have a gun and a motorcycle, don't get within melee range of an unarmed man who has his back against you and is on a horse, just shoot him in the back, many many times, shoot the horse if necessary. 3) If you have many people against one, don't make them attack one by one, make them attack all at once. 4) If you know where your enemy is coming next, set up a trap. Use grenades, flash bangs, nets, eletricity, gas, etc. 5) Don't kill your allies. 6) Don't give Wick a chance to recover if you intend to kill him. 7) Don't give him an armored suit without a GPS on it. 8) Don't give time for your enemy to hole up in to a good defense position. 9) Stop giving weapons and ammo by getting close to Wick. 10) If you have armor that is immune to bullets, go forward and kill him, instead of waiting for him to get better weapons. 11) Don't let unarmed people, who are going to order other people to murder you, alive.",

    "reviewTitle": "Highly Entertaining If Somewhat Exhausting.",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an action film that delights, practically revels, in violence - so much so that one can reasonably draw comparisons to the visceral sequences in other contemporary foreign action films like The Raid series (which is fitting considering Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman, who both star in The Raid and The Raid 2, appear in this film). It's also not too shy of developing its narrative either, or more accurately, its world-building. What was once a humble little world in the first film in the series is now an ever-expanding labyrinth of alliances and hidden societies that make you question how deep these organizations (and Wick's relationships) run. Chapter 3's cast is largely the same, with a few highlights like Sofia (Halle Berry) and her vicious pack of dogs or the Adjudicator as a compelling antagonist, being suitably arrogant and condescending. The plot is also straightforward enough as to be expected, with its ending being particularly noteworthy. Winston's apparent betrayal of John Wick feels earned, seems in-character and I didn't see it coming at all, which is more than can be expected of many action movie plot twists. But make no mistake: despite my praise for the film's world design, much of the film's emphasis is still placed on the action sequences as it should be.There's so much action in fact to the point where, near the end, my eyes were starting to get numb to what was happening onscreen. Wait, am I really going to criticise an action movie for having too much action? Well, kinda...sorta...not really. Look, the action and cinematography for all of the sequences was entertaining and it always, at the very least, kept things fresh through the choreography, camera work, environment and lighting. And the film knew what it was and didn't try to be anything more than an intense, stylised, action extravaganza. As a complete package though? It doesn't excel at everything, but it didn't necessarily need to. In all, I'd say John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is highly entertaining if somewhat exhausting, but it's still well worth a watch. But if you're a John Wick fan, you didn't need me to tell you that.Overall: mid-to-high 7/10, maybe low 8/10.",

Kick-ass continuation in the action franchise with laconic assassin-on-the run/dog lover Wick (Reeves having a helluva field day) facing immense odds on his life with practically EVERYONE out to kill him with a $14M bounty on his head.

    "reviewTitle": "Uninspired crap!",
    "reviewBody": "I liked the first John Wick and the second. All in all it's a cool idea and the action is very clear and good choreographed. The look of this movie is professional, sure. And I got the nice reference on 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly', when John Wick re-asembled some old weapons in a weapon museum like Tuco Ramirez did in the old western with Clint Eastwood. After some playtime I had the first feeling of being bored. It seemed that the creativity of the action exhausted.I can imagine that the creators had the same idea and made a big deal: They let one big evil guy shoot at a dog (which has a bullet proof vest). So the dog can take its revenge and bite the bad guys nuts. A shocking moment, ok. But after that the fugitive John Wick and his female partner fight through the army of guards using the dogs as weapons by letting them bite the nuts of the guys. These are cheap shock moments for saving some money instead of creating better action. After a bunch of further nut bites, we stopped the movie. It became more and more ridiculous.This is just shockbaiting people with cheap methods. The nuts are allways the best shockers. Only kicking or stabbing wasn't enough, ok. But why not choosing really new ideas? This series lost its charme. After 1 hour and 8 minutes we were just bored by always seing the same dumb shock moment and turned that crap of.If the story would have been better, we would have turned a blind eye. But the only fresh moment was when Anjelica Huston arrived on screen. The hunting scenario is not better than any teenager countdown in cheap horror movies. Just vice versa. So the bullet clips have 100 bullets each? There are hundrets or thousands of assassins in a city and surely an army of underground organization crime-scene-cleaners for sure, so there are no press people or cops involved. (Really?) Normaly we would have turned a blind eye. But that movie was clearly too much crap.",

It's beautifully brutal entertainment and I'm ok with that, I don't always need a gripping plot.\nThe fight scenes are not repetitive in my opinion, they are relentless and seem to go on and on - which is exhausting to watch, but feels realistic. Highly skilled combatants can fight beyond pain and injury that would render us mere mortals flat out finished - plus it's bloody fantastical entertainment is it not? It's not meant to be literal New York City.\nI love how gangly and uncoordinated Keane Reeves can appear - then the fight starts and he's brutally efficient and makes hilarious use of whatever is to hand. I mean, I'll never look at my books in the same way, and the horses were used to exceptional effect.\nI thought Halle Berry was great, and her beautiful Mallinois dogs - weapons of mass  destruction!\nIt was also rather amusing to see old Mark Dacascus brought out of the martial arts closet - I liked his character.\nWick quoting from the Matrix with his \"I need guns, lots of guns\" did make me smile.\nA visual triumph, a masterpiece of hand to hand combat choreography, beautiful canine killing machines - for me the perfect Sunday afternoon switch-off from life movie.

    "reviewTitle": "Wicked John At Work!!!",
    "reviewBody": "Least we appear animals, much ado is made about rules in the slam-bang threequel \"John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" with Keanu Reeves reprising his role as the fearless gunman whose rampage arose after a gangster shot his puppy to death. This bullet-riddled, melodramatic trilogy about a vengeful retired hitman wronged by his former accomplices seems like the last place where anybody would abide by rules. The international underworld depicted in this second globe-trotting entry maintains an inflexible code of rules. For example, a prestigious Continental Hotel operates in virtually every country and serves as much as a safehouse for criminals as a mode of accommodation. Comparably, these Continentals resemble foreign embassies because each provides safe refuge for criminals. Specifically, Continental Hotels forbid gunplay on the premises between members of any crime families. Violating the sanctity of a Continental Hotel means immediate excommunication. Excommunication means you die. If you missed the first two \"John Wick\" shoot'em ups, you would be surprised by the magnitude of this criminal code. Director Chad Stahelski, who helmed the original \"John Wick\" as well as the sequel \"John Wick: Chapter 2,\" spends more time on this code and its consequences. Marginally longer than the previous entries, the third outing makes room for an adjudicator. This imperious personage scrutinizes the facts, judges everybody implicated, and arbitrates an outcome. Nevertheless, despite these loquacious interludes, \"John Wick 3\" still delivers high-octane, adrenalin-laced action scenes with pugnacious adversaries. Halle Berry joins Keanu Reeves as a gun-toting dame with two vicious, crotch-munching canines. Fans of the earlier epics should be gratified considering the astronomical high body count, the acrobatic close-quarters combat choreography, and our charismatic hero's resilience. Of course, little of this aggressive, over-the-top actioneer qualifies as remotely plausible, but it makes for cathartic, larger-than-life entertainment!\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" opens during the final moments of \"John Wick: Chapter 2.\" Our drenched but well-dressed hero and his faithful dog jog through the rainswept streets of Manhattan. Even the homeless know about John Wick's predicament. Pausing for a breather in an alley, Wick spots a homeless man (Jason Mantzoukas of \"Neighbors\") who taps his wristwatch and says: \"Tick Tock!\" Suspense rears its ugly head early as we are reminded repeatedly about the few remaining minutes until 6 PM when Wick's excommunication commences. Meantime, every greedy soul is drooling over the prospect of the $14 million 'open contract' payday on Wick's scalp. Our hero looks worried, too. Wick packs his dog off to the Continental via taxi, while he hoofs it to the New York Public Library. No, Keanu isn't on screen for every minute of this threequel's 130-minute running time. Those bespectacled, tattooed secretaries at the High Table Headquarters who type documents and slap ink stamps on them provide updates. The Underworld constitutes big business, with its own peculiar laws and its own watch-dog agencies. The high-brow Adjudicator (newcomer Asia Kate Dillon) marches into the fray. She takes names and levies penalties. John Wick isn't the only one with something to dread in this installment. The Adjudicator reprimands both Winston (Ian McShane of \"Deadwood\") and Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne of \"The Matrix\") for giving aid and comfort to John Wick. Remember, King gave John seven bullets and a pistol, while Winston gave him an hour to flee before loosening an army of executioners. The Adjudicator conscripts a nimble-fingered, sushi-chef/contract killer, Zero (world renowned Martial Artist Mark Dacascos of \"Cradle 2 the Grave\") to dispense punishment. Everything starts out without a hint about the rollercoaster ride ahead for audiences and some of the surprising narrative twists.Not everybody is content to accommodate the deadline. No sooner has our hero arrived at the New York Public Library than a familiar adversary confronts him. This is the first glimpse of what lies ahead. A contract killer has staked out the stacks, and he dwarfs John Wick in both size and stature. Our hero disposes of this dastard with a thick book. Although he is still fond of the double-tap head shot, Wick doesn't always have pistol at hand to vanquish his enemies. His clash with a gang of chop-socky Asians turns into a blizzard of flying knives. Later, Wick proves he is every bit as dangerous with a hatchet. At one point, he hurls a hatchet halfway across a room, and the somersaulting blade sinks into an enemy's skull. Wick can sling knives with the best of them, too. Our hero shuns automobiles in favor of a horse. Some lighter moments occurs when Wick slaps a horse on the rump, and the animal whips a hind leg back like a catapult to deck an unsuspecting gunman. Wicks contends with several Asians on motorcycles bristling with traditional samurai Shinogi-Zukuri katanas. All these close-quarters combat scenes are staged with as little CGI as possible. The physical violence seems almost kinetic at times. Wick slams into his enemies, toppling them, and wrestling their weapons away from them. As impeccable as always, Wick emerges from each fracas without any damage to his suit.Director Chad Stahelski and scenarists Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams plunge even deeper into John Wick's shadowy origins. Wick appeals for help from an old friend, a ballet director (Anjelica Huston of \"The Addams Family\"), who knew him before he emigrated to America. Wicks' roots can be traced back to Eastern Europe. Happily, our hero crosses the Atlantic Ocean without incident and reaches the shores of Casablanca. Wick calls on Sofia (Halle Berry of \"Die Another Day\"), to honor a marker owed him, but she isn't happy to see him again. Nevertheless, she ushers him into the presence of a prominent member of the High Table to atone for his sins. Although she isn't in \"John Wick 3\" more than a quarter hour, Sofia and her two canine ice almost as many adversaries as our hero, and she makes an unforgettable impression. \"John Wick 3\" orchestrates even more outlandish escapades than its exhilarating predecessors.",

    "reviewBody": "Spoiler warning just to be safe.John Wick: Parabellum is better than John Wick 2, but does not have the same strength in story as the first John Wick film. Where it exceeds is the action choreography and the consequences of actions coming back to bite the characters. It also gave a hint of John Wick's backstory, which was nice. Another strong point is that the main antagonist (Zero) was enjoyable. He was skilled, brought dark humor and had a determination to prove himself. Unlike Caspian, Zero actually lived up to the hype. It honestly was kind of sad to see him go, but he definitely gave John a good beating. Sofia was also another good character that left a good impression with her gun okay, her dogs and a bit of inner conflict. I would even suggest that her dogs help her cope with the choices she had to make prior to Parabellum. It will be great if she returns should there be a Chapter 4.Now one of the weak points of the film is that they expanded the role of the High Table, which at first glance is not bad, but what they did was made their influence so massive that it brings one to wonder who *isn't* under their control? The opportunity to introduce more factions was missed. Also, while the action choreography was great, the story felt overall shallow and was bizarre in some parts. Particularly with the introduction of the Elder and the last scene between John and Winston. They also missed out on an opportunity to show off Charon and took the lazy route by having the Continental security get wiped out in the final act way too fast instead of having an epic gun battle between High Table and supposedly one of the most secured buildings in New York. Essentially, the world building that was used was used poorly, and opportunities were missed to expand in more than one area of John Wick's world.John Wick: Parabellum is not a terrible movie, but it is not as good as it could have been. If you want a movie with great action, this is the one for you. But John Wick 1 so far has the best story out of the three.",

And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: \"The action was gibberish.\" You couldn't see anything.I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be \"a good guy,\" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have to ask, what were they thinking?",

And this film is a lot of trouble.It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that Möbius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, Möbius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while.",

    "reviewBody": "Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.I am at this point slightly concerned that I may have made this sound more interesting, complex, and unconventional, than it actually is. In a lot of ways this feels like it should have come out 15 to 20 years ago. It's been in development for that amount of time, so maybe they just didn't do that much to change it anytime recently, to keep it up-to-date, since this is a subgenre that has evolved tremendously in that time? Without a doubt if this had come out one to two decades ago, we would be looking at it as a product of its time, rather than something that is completely out of date. It still wouldn't be good. Not even close. But we'd be going easier on it than we, rightfully, are now.Clearly Matt Smith is enjoying himself. And his enthusiasm is infectious. For a while I was thinking, \"it doesn't really fit with the rest of what's on screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over the place\". And then he started doing that literally. On more than one occasion. In separate scenes. The action is decent, although the meh, and at times possibly unfinished, special effects do make it harder to make out. This was clearly trimmed down, and a lot of the things we were excited about from the trailers are either majorly altered or a scene that is now just a clip with narration.I recommend this to those who miss the bad old days of the first Ghost Rider flick. 3/10.",

    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who has devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born with. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who previously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past work tells you what you need to know.An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around the water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire bats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure. All of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their deteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr. Nikolis (Jared Harris, \"Mad Men\").Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as \"The Living Vampire\", so we kinda know where things are headed. It's a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his characterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and Morbius' love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). You've probably guessed that the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI agents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to the high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and it's the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the 'hey, I like this superhuman power' Milo.The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the story, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in years. Sure, the film's release has been delayed a couple of years, but that's no excuse for what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his scenes. We do wish for more of Martine's story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of the SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. It's clear this film's mission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, I believe it's fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication where the sequel is headed.Opening in theaters April 1, 2022.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"We shouldn't be here when it gets dark.\"",
    "reviewBody": "Underwhelmed as I left the theater, I thought maybe I missed something but my trip here to the review pages confirms my opinion. Forgetting about the Morbius character's ties to the Marvel Comic Book franchise, this is basically a run of the mill vampire flick, and unfortunately, it doesn't break any new ground for the genre. The story is somewhat ordinary, as Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) seeks a cure for a rare blood disease, and by experimenting with bats, manages to turn himself into a creature of the night. His childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who helped fund the research for a cure, self infects with the same serum and discovers a lust for power that comes with the transformation. It's a pretty tepid plot line that results in some head scratching CGI considering how far special effects have evolved to the present day. More effective is the virtually seamless facial metamorphosis from human to vampire and back again, but it's something you expect nowadays and not particularly innovative. It all brings into question why the filmmakers would go for such a tired and formulaic approach for a vampire super-hero. When all is said and done, you can't even say that Morbius came out of the picture as a good guy, as his options didn't suggest much more than defeating Milo's alter-ego in a final vampiric showdown.",

And that he is being played by a guy who also portrayed the Joker.That aside, I can see that some people don't like the movie. The CGI isn't that good - especially considering the budget this must have had. There is also a dance (by the main villain) that reminds us of the bad dance by Tobey Maguire in Spiderman 3 ... also as cringeworthy as the one from back then. We then also get a Kayser Soze moment. Well not as iconic as the one from the Usual Suspects ... but it still is there.We have a lot of scary faces, but not a lot of blood. Considering the violence and the death that are occuring ... this does not display them as visual as it could. But if it did, this wouldn't have gotten a PG-13 now would it? While this is a Marvel character, it is owned by Sony .. but as you may be aware there are other things that seem to get .. into the mix. One of them has an appearance during the credits ... in two scenes. No scene after the credits .. but those two scenes suggest something that Jared Leto has already hinted at himself ... an new Universe is building ... well if the powers to be and the box office allows them to.Not a bad movie overall, but lacking a few things, even though the actors and the cinematography are not to be blamed (the latter has some bad moments especially during the last fight, where I couldn't tell where up and down was) ... sound was amazing, but I watched it in an Atmos cinema, so there's that. Very flawed but not as bad as some probably think it is ... it is an origin story and is quite stale pace wise ... but it is what it is.",

The only thing I'm spoiling here is when Morbius shows up to this lab, full of thugs. After damaging a guys bones to make him leave, Morbius says: \"I am...Venom.\" THATS the part that made me walk out. Like, shut up. Just no. Did this guy really say he's Venom? Goodness gracious. All I was watching here was this vampire randomly killing people for no reason, because of this \"curse\" that he can't control. You can't look at Morbius as this hero or anything at all. You're not rooting for anyone in this film. Its pathetic. You're gonna be sitting there wondering what's going on, why a lot of stuff is happening, what's happening and when the film will end. You will not care. Trust me. This is only 2/10 for its cool effects and action sequences. That's it.",

Milo (Matt Smith) first met twenty five years ago in a hospital where they were both being treated for a rare blood disease. Their doctor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) noted Michael's exceptional intellect and sent him off for further studies. Presently, Michael has become a brilliant doctor and scientist who had been able to develop life-saving artificial blood which earned him a Nobel Prize.Working on the anti-thrombotic elements of the saliva of vampire bats he had collected from Costa Rica, Michael invented a drug which could cure the affliction he (and Milo) suffered from. However, because human trials were illegal for such substances, he conspired with his girlfriend Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to inject the serum into him on a ship on international waters. The terrifying effects were not what they were expecting.Morbius was a character from Marvel Comics that I had no idea about. This was a Sony release, like the original Spider-Man and adjacent characters like Venom and Carnage, and so it won't be directly connected with main Marvel Cinematic Universe which is under Disney. There is controversy among fans how Sony was confusing the story arc of the MCU, like seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the closing credits of \"Venom.\"Being his origin story, we see how Morbius met his best friend and blood brother Milo, and how his bold experiments had brought their friendship into the next level. Jared Leto played Morbius all moody, broody, and mired in his moral predicament, in sharp contrast with Matt Smith (best known as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor in \"Doctor Who\" and Prince Philip in \"The Crown\") who played Milo all loud, gleeful and manic.Aside from the vampiric transformations, CG effects ranged from subtle (like his ear wiggling for echolocation) to bombastic (like his high-speed wave forms tinged with bright colors from his clothing). Director Daniel Espinosa effectively created an atmosphere of dread and horror, but kept things within a PG rating. A character last seen in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" appeared in the closing credits scenes hinting a Multiverse connection. 6/10.",

For those unfamiliar with the character, Jared plays Doctor Michael Morbius, a biochemist with a rare blood disease and he has spent his life looking for a cure. He was also a villain that tangled with Spider_Man a lot in the comics before he turned good-kind of like how Venom did. Matt is Jared's childhood friend that has the same disease. In his search, Jared experiments with vampire bat enzymes and comes up with a serum that cures his disease but also changes himself into a vampire feeding on blood. Of course, Matt wants the cure too but Jared thinks it's too dangerous. Adria is Jared's lab assistant/doctor friend that helps him and when dead bodies start showing up-drained of blood-Tyrese plays the F. B. I. Agent that is investigating the murders. The fights are not as good as the ones in the last Spider_Man movie-maybe I was just expecting too much-so it was a little bit of a let down. There are 2 scenes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end-that hint at a sinister sequel.It's rated PG-13 for violence, frightening images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.As I said, I love super hero movies so I would probably buy it on DVD.

I had very low expectations for this film, and I guess you could say this film met them! It really was a complete mess of a film, but this made it entertaining occasionally.Firstly, Jared Leto was already a bad pick, portraying the character with no emotions and no likeability to him so I really didn't care what happened to him. I also feel like the characters were VERY poorly written which didn't help, with a super forced unnecessary romance. Matt Smith was the main redeemable quality of this film, he tried his best and at least brought an ounce of personality.Speaking of the writing, the humour felt incredibly flat. It was probably the weakest attempt I've seen in a Sony or Marvel film. The only times I laughed were when I was cringing because the film made me THAT uncomfortable. However, I did somewhat enjoy hate-watching for the bad humour.The visual effects and cinematography was okay. The CGI for the most part wasn't terrible in comparison with the other elements of this film, but there were some moments that stuck out in a negative way. The fight scenes looked okay but were also incredibly goofy to the point where I often laughed at them.The pacing of this film was an absolute mess, The movie really proves the phrase 'time flies when you're having fun' wrong, as this film felt like it went by in about 45 minutes. It also ends incredibly abruptly and doesn't attempt to come to a proper conclusion, it felt unfinished.Lastly, the end credit scenes were completely unnecessary. Both of the scenes were pretty much the same, and were just a petty attempt at trying to cram all the characters into one universe again.",

Basically, at a hospital in Greece, ten-year-old Michael Morbius (Charlie Shotwell) forms a close bond with his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo (Joseph Esson). They both share a rare blood disease and desire to be free of their illness and to be \"normal\".

Twenty-five years later, Michael (Jared Leto) is awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding achievement in biochemistry, creating synthetic blood that saved many lives, but he publicly declines the award. Michael has recently returned from Costa Rica and has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats, which his colleague Martine Bancroft (Emerald City's Adria Arjona) discovers. Michael hopes to splice the genes of the bats with his own to develop a cure for his condition. He visits Milo (Matt Smith), still being cared for by Nicholas, and informs him of his planned illegal experiment. After receiving funding from Milo to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. After running tests on a lab rats, Michael and Martine are pleased by a successful solution being created, and Michael is ready for the human trial, on himself. Michael drinks the solution, but is instantly transformed into a monstrous vampire, knocking Martine unconscious, and killing all crew members aboard, and draining their blood. Michael regains his senses after his bloodlust subsides, but has no memory of his actions, and is horrified after watching the CCTV. He erases the CCTV footage of his experiment and what happened, calls the authorities to locate the vessel, and jumps overboard, leaving Martine unconscious. Michael returns to New York and is amazed by his newfound superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation (hearing distant sounds), and his vampire bats are at one with him. He is able to walk in sunlight, but remains in his lab, maintaining his lust of blood with his synthetic blood until it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs and time to do so is decreasing. The vessel is located and investigating FBI agents Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Alberto \"Al\" Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) deduce Michael's involvement in the deaths. Michael is questioned but released with no substantial evidence on suspicion of murder. Milo learns that Michael has found a cure but is furious when Michael refuses to give it to him, warning him of its danger. Martine awakens in hospital, but also does not give any real answers to the FBI questions. Michael visits Martine and is shocked to discover the body of a dead nurse. Believing to be responsible for her death, he tries to escape, but is cornered and arrested. Milo visits Michael in prison and offers to use his wealth to get him out. But Michael realises that Milo has taken the cure and killed the nurse. Michael manages to escape and finds Milo in a subway station, he is unrepentant, confessing his bloodlust-induced crime, he urges Michael to embrace his powers. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Michael flees. Michael meets Martine to explain everything, from the positives of the cure to the hideous crimes of Milo. Finding an underground criminal lair, Michael scares away a gang and acquires a new lab to develop an anticoagulant to stop and kill Milo. He also intends to use the solution on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks, they believe Michael, as a vampire, is spreading a curse and the story is released to the media to track him down. Nicholas sees the footage and recognises Milo carrying out the attack in the subway. Milo returns and Nicholas pleads with him to stop, Milo is angered he may prefer Michael, he responds by wounding him and calling Michael. Nicholas dies in Michael's arms while Milo goes on to attack Martine. Michael returns to Martine, but he is too late, she also dies in his arms, and he drinks her blood. Michael confronts Milo and, as vampires, they brutally fight in an abandoned underground construction. Milo overpowers Michael, until he summons an army of bats to restrain him, allowing him to inject the anticoagulant. Milo momentarily mourns his surrogate brother as he dies, then he flies away with his bats as the authorities surround the area. Michael mourns the loss of his loved ones and embraces his identity as a vampire. Michael is unaware that his vampiric powers have entered Martine's bloodstream, and she is revived with newly developed powers. Meanwhile, Adrian Toomes aka Vulture (Michael Keaton) when he finds himself transported by a spell (by Doctor Strange) from Peter Parker's universe into Michael's and is released from prison. He later approaches Michael and suggests that they join forces. Also starring Corey Johnson as Mr. Fox and Joanna Burnett as Nurse Kristen Sutton. Leto has followed his deserved Oscar win in Dallas Buyers Club with some disappointing performances, from a terrible punk Joker in Suicide Squad to a Razzie winning over-the-top Italian idiot in House of Gucci, thank goodness here he is tolerable and suitably moody, Arjona is beautiful and does well, but Smith gives a scene-stealing performance as the villain with a dry and dark sense of humour. It is a fairly predictable story of a biochemist trying to cure himself of a deathly disease and becoming something nasty in the process, the anti-hero plot is a bit disjointed at times, the friend turned enemy and horrors elements are reasonable, you want to see where it's going, and you cannot deny the special effects are fantastic, so it's worthwhile enough superhero vampire action. Okay!",

    "reviewTitle": "Should have been better",
    "reviewBody": "Michael Morbius was born with a rare blood disease which threatens to cut his life short (and also friend Milo's). Fortunately he isca brilliant scientist, and his research leads to a vampire bat-based serum. For anyone who has ever seen a science fiction or horror film, or read a comic, the side effects will come as no surprise.This movie has come in for moderate criticism which, in my view, isn't wholly deserved. The story is solid, if unsurprising, a routine superhero origin. The cast are all good. The effects are well executed.The problems, because there are for sure problems, come down to script and direction. There are areas which need explanation but none is offered - why does Michael call Lucien Milo? What exactly are the powers which come with the treatment? Dressed up in special effects, there is an echo-location thingie, also some sort of smeary thing which is flying? I dunno. The fact that the effects often take place in extreme darkness and rapidly edited jigglecam adds to the difficulty in following what's going on. This shouldn't be difficult to follow - it's a straightforward story - but the director seems to have sacrificed clarity in favour of style, and this was not a good decision. The scenes setting up follow-ups also have an element of \"Huh?\"This is not as bad as it's painted, but it should have been much better.The interaction of Sony's Spiderverse with Disney's MCU continues to intrigue and entertain.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel's Living Vampire Makes His Screen Debut!",
    "reviewBody": "The latest incarnation of a Marvel Comics character in director Daniel Espinosa's \"Morbius,\" starring Oscar winner Jared Leto as the shape-shifting vampire, hasn't proven itself the blockbuster either Sony Pictures or the public sought. The studio greenlighted this $75 million anti-heroic epic after the phenomenal success of the audacious \"Venom\" movies. \"Morbius\" shares little in common with the two Tom Hardy outings. For example, legendary biochemist Michael Morbius has no symbiotic sidekick who provides comic relief. Although \"Morbius\" debuted with a healthy $39 million haul its first weekend, the super villain saga suffered a steep setback, plunging 73 percent during its second weekend, coining a mere $10.2 million in ticket sales. Film critics have panned it. Now, it also seems the public is less than elated. The Screen Rant website reported: \"'Morbius' didn't go over well with audiences and currently boasts the lowest CinemaScore of any Marvel-based movie since 2015's 'Fantastic 4.'\" Meantime, The Direct website added: \"'Morbius' will have suffered the second-worst box office drop in the superhero genre right after NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal's 'Steel' from 1997.\"Apparently the critics and the public must have forgotten \"Morbius\" is a supervillain. Were they anticipating a carbon copy of \"Venom?\" Mind you, the PG-13 rated \"Morbius\" is far darker than the typical Marvel superhero saga. Nothing about this 105-minute origins epic is remotely facetious. Morbius doesn't don a spandex outfit like he did for his debut in The Amazing Spider-Man comic #101 (October 1971), and nobody spouts any clever dialogue. Basically, \"Morbius\" emerges as a horror fantasy laden with allusions to \"Dracula\" and \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.\" When Michael transforms from a sickly to a scary person, he doesn't resemble an urbane Christopher Lee in a dinner jacket. Instead, he appears repulsive, like a skull-faced demon from an \"Exorcist\" knock-off. Clearly, the critics and the public alike wanted something far more flamboyant.Sony and Disney own the rights to various Marvel characters. The Disney Marvel characters are appealing. \"Iron Man,\" \"Captain America,\" \"Black Widow,\" and \"Thor\" are role models for kids. Indeed, these characters are immaculate, while Michael Morbius knows his evil potential and wrestles with his split-personality. \"Dracula Untold\" co-scenarists Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless appropriated story material from Bram Stoker's classic novel \"Dracula.\" Not only is the sovereign vampire mentioned in dialogue excerpts, but the narrative also features a ship cruising outside the 12-mile limit in international waters. Several thugs armed with assault rifles die hideously on it. Similarly, in \"Dracula,\" the eponymous vampire exsanguinated the entire crew of the Demeter. For the record, a different version of this incident occurred in \"The Amazing Spider-man\" comic book. Sazama & Sharpless paint a more sympathetic portrait of Morbius. When Morbius saw his colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona of \"The Belko Experiment\"), strewn unconscious on the floor of the ship's laboratory, he went berserk and massacred the mercenaries, rather like as Dracula did the Demeter crew. Once he realizes the enormity of his conduct, Morbius wipes the surveillance video clean and radios for help. None of the traditional Marvel characters would tolerate such an atrocity. Afterward, Morbius vows never to do anything as heinous again.Mind you, these mercenaries had nearly killed Martine, so Morbius' behavior could be deemed chivalric. As you can see, Espinosa takes things rather seriously as does Michael Morbius. Jared Leto looks convincing as a man cursed with a dreaded blood disease. Things don't really improve after he engineers artificial plasma for use on battlefields. Instead, Morbius discovers a cure. Unfortunately, the cure turns him into a monster! Moreover, one of Michael's closest friends, Milo (Matt Smith, the 11th \"Doctor Who\"), suffers from a condition similar to Milo's. Michael had promised to share any breakthrough treatment. The problem is Michael needs human blood, a luxury that only goes so far in its artificial format. Once he develops blood infused with vampire bat DNA, Michael faces the prospect of having to kill people. Meantime, Milo lacks Michael's discipline. If he cannot get what he wants, Milo will devour humans without a qualm. Essentially, Michael and Milo emerge as different sides of a coin. This difference enhances the dramatic tension between these childhood pals.\"Morbius\" opens in Costa Rica where our protagonist has gone to trap vampire bats for his blood work studies. Sony could have made a movie strictly about Morbius transporting these deadly vampire bats to New York City. We learn Morbius suffers from a rare, incurable, blood disease. During his youth, he spent many years in a sanitarium for special needs children. One day Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris of \"Lincoln\") introduces Michael to another young patient named Lucien. These two grow up and bond until Michael leaves the sanitarium to attend a special school for the gifted. As a renowned hematologist, Michael invents artificial blood, and an adult Lucien (Matt Smith) bankrolls Michael's research. His prestige as a researcher spreads when he not only wins the Nobel Prize but then refuses to accepts it.Neither Espinosa nor Sazama and Sharpless bite off more than they can chew with \"Morbius.\" The filmmakers acquaint audiences with Morbius as well as his predicament. Since his survival depends on drinking human blood, Morbius must come to terms with his destiny. Apart from Ang Lee's \"Hulk\" (2003), few traditional Marvel characters encounter such life-or-death extremes as Morbius. Essentially, the filmmakers have forged a character of greater depth than \"Iron Man,\" \"Captain America,\" \"Thor,\" and \"Dr. Strange.\" None of these superheroes face Morbius' challenge. Happily, overseas audiences have given \"Morbius\" a boost, buying $81 million in tickets to this sterling Sony release and raising its global haul to $148 million plus!",

    "reviewBody": "I am a constructive critique: I tell what they could have done better and not to chastise.I am a massive Spider-Man fan and so I have heard of Morbius' character from watching Spider-Man the animated series. So finding out that Joker was cast to play The Living Vampire, I was excited....Spoiler-free review first...\nI liked Morbius' design, very cool and very frightening while looking pretty comic-accurate! :)\nI am also obsessed with Doctor Who, so finding out that Matt Smith is in this picture made me light up excited.I enjoyed watching Jered Leto, bravo on his acting as always, very good physical acting on his part as well for the first half before his change.I definitely believed that Michael really wants to help people, so he was a very cheer-worthy protagonist.Overall the plot made sense to me.I am glad this film didn't have as much humour as the Venom films have (not to dis on the Venom films)\nPretty cool graphic effects. Also, a lot of their vampire bat facts were true, so very good on doing your research for the script!And while I am a horror movie fan, I am glad that this wasn't a horror movie so that kids can enjoy watching this comic book story.To sum up, I did enjoy watching this movie :){SPOILERS ahead}\nHere is what they could have done 'better' (in my opinion) I don't like rating films thatI liked to be below a 7/10, so this is why I deducted some points away from a perfectly enjoyable movie:\nThe writing; I am a perfectionist and so I usually am not completely satisfied with an art project unless I see every angle as near air-tight as possible. I thought Agent Rodriguez' dialogue was a bit too much (I just found out he's played by a comedian but still)\nI wish the film had a bit more depth to it, Milo's character development into becoming a villain felt forced and not exactly 'believable' I guess, I just didn't see the reason for him to turn on and try and kill Michael. Also, while I am a Matt Smith fan, I would have had him act different post-serum than what was given instead (I like my villains deadly-serious) ...also how did Milo take the vampire serum if it needed to be injected into the spine by a second person?There was a few moments in the film where I thought the scene-palette could have been different, but the majority of the film had nice colours.I just didn't leave the theatre having that epic blood-rush flow through me as I do with a lot of superhero films, I can't exactly tell what it is the film lacked, but it's just this feeling in me of incompleteness.I would like to know what's in store next for Michael Morbius now that he is still possibly a wanted 'criminal'.Also, I got really pumped for this film when I watched the trailer on Youtube, and I notice that movies a lot of time now have this problem where the trailer is a bit more epic than all of what the film turned out to be. I didn't see the Spider-Man graffiti on the wall, Morbius being a bit lighthearted after delivering that \"I'm Venom\" line and Vulture bumping into Michael in the hall.And as a mild comment, I wasn't particularly fond of the title graphics at the beginning and end with the vector purple scheme (but that's just me as a graphic designer)\nI am excited to see how this Venom-verse will progress in the making of more films, I am excited. I really hope Morbius will continue to be in more of these films and getting some screentime with my favourite wall-crawling hero :)",

    "reviewBody": "So, from hearing about this Film I wasn't in any hurry to watch as previous films of the DC/MCU Universe haven't been great. But from seeing the scathing reviews left, right & center, made me think this probably wasn't going to be too bad. I was sort of right.The film sees Morbius trying to find a cure for his illness via creating artificial blood, but the side effects are far more devastating than he could've imagined as the new blood turns him into a blood thirsty Vampire. So, while trying to find a way to reverse the effects he simultaneously has to stop his friend with the same illness he has from causing havoc across the city after he himself is injected with the same artificial blood specimen.I found the film to be average. It's not amazing & is quite dull, hollow & soulless in a couple of areas which makes for a sort of mundane viewing. Saying that though, the story is simple, the action is pretty good if not as bout as average as it comes with super hero films & action films in general. The effects are pretty good also & the film has a great runtime of 1 hour & 33 minutes, 1 hour & 37 minutes including the mid & end credit scenes. The pacing wasn't too bad, if not a bit slow. The violence & gore could've been better as with the characters who felt flat & cardboard.Overall, it's average. It's not nearly as bad as what critics are saying. You'll enjoy it for what it is & should be enjoyed for that reason. Give it a watch, trust me.5/10.",

My only complaints are what you would probably call nitpicking. I'm not a huge fan of how everything looks smokey, at first I thought this was Morbius's perspective with his echo/hearing, but then everything was smokey. Also this seems to completely copy Venom in the way where Morbius becomes a anti-hero, instead of a bad guy. Isn't Morbius supposed to be a villain? Is everyone gonna become a anti-hero?I was enjoying it until Milo (Matt Smith) becomes the antagonist, then it just kinda became stupid.But it isn't nearly as horrible as people are making it out to be.

Morbius: cursed good guy, Doctor Lady: moves plot forward, Bad guy: be bad, Cops: absolutely useless, Father: also useless. At least this movie is short, it just ends abruptly. One of those tokyo ghoul or dune type endings.Please, don't waste your time watching this movie. Pick any other movie on Netflix or whatever and watch that instead.",

    "reviewTitle": "Sony really need to stop",
    "reviewBody": "Morbius was a movie I was interested in knowing about Michael Morbius's character that I read about in the comics. He was a troubled guy who wanted to make the world better in the comics. And when getting to the film has been delayed for almost two years since July 31, 2020. Unfortunately, however, Morbius, the film was not that. This movie is a complete mess. Hot Garbage. It's poorly made in almost all aspects. The story is disjointed, the basic dialogue, the character depth is barely there, and the superficial relationships. After No Way Home, Sony decided to put their fingerprints all over the movie, and every time they did that, it didn't go that well. If you look at Spider-man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Venom, Venom: Let there be Carnage, and now this film, again, they want to be like the MCU instead of being their own thing. They want to make the films like the cinematic universe and kid-friendly characters. When it shouldn't be like that, characters like Morbius, Venom, and Carnage are not kid-friendly. These films need to be more adult than just ten years old; the movies like Logan, Deadpool, and Joker are box office successes and amazing films.Pros: Matt Smith stole the show, he was the best part of the movie, and I understand his motivation to be a villain and wanting to be cured. The visuals were amazing too. And I love the tone; it was by far better than Venom 1 and 2, as I always want the films to be serious when it needs to be.Cons: Everything else that was in the movie. This is an Avi Arad production, so my expectations were low going into this, and Matt Tolmach and Lucas Foster were also on board to make the stakes of success even lower than ever. It's boring. The writers didn't make the stakes evident, and the story flow was weak. The characters made the fact that we needed to care about these characters, besides Matt Smith's character. The love between Morbius and Bancroft was somewhat forced on me that many people need to have a love interest. However, this is still better than Eddie and Anne in the Venom movies. The ending ends, and it was the most disappointing thing I have ever seen. And the post-credits scenes, the better I forget about that existing, the better.Overall, Sony needs to stop with these films, and if they make movies without setting up a cinematic universe and without touching the films, these films would be levels like Deadpool, Logan, and Joker. But with this, I won't be watching anything else coming from Sony. Except for Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse Part 1 and 2, I hope Sony doesn't put their nasty fingerprints all over the film. 2/10. Disappointing.",

    "reviewBody": "SCORE: 6.2/10Alright, I'm going to do my best to review this as a film, mid/post credit scene aside, to start. For one, I don't understand the HATE for this movie. It took the exact formula of Venom and replaced the humor with intensity. I personally enjoyed this more than Venom. I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film and found myself somewhat excited to see what would happen next. Admittedly, acting was subpar in a few areas, the storytelling was pretty bad, and the entire movie felt a little off when it comes to pacing, but overall this was an enjoyable movie to watch.Now to talk about the mid/post credit scene. As a Marvel Fan, I have grown to be just as excited about the mid/post credit scene as I am about the film itself. I am in belief, just like in Venom, that a subpar movie can be enhanced by a meaningful mid/post credit scene. I am still in shock that whoever made the trailers for this movie decided to spoil the mid/post credit scene. If I had no idea that the Vulture was involved, those scenes would've enhanced my feeling towards this movie. I just want to meet the person whose idea it was to do that and understand the point of spoiling that part of the movie for the audience. It is almost on the same level of if we saw the portal scene of Andrew and Tobey coming through in the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer. What were they thinking?",

Then, a scene where Morbius simply put 2 vials of the most dangerous serum that turns human to super vampire, on the table just like that. I mean, he should have hidden them somewhere safe and secure!The rest of the movie, is, rather good. And Jared's acting is on point. Not great, but not bad either. Matt Smith's acting as a villain is more prominent, I have to be honest.The CGI, is also NOT THAT BAD. Acceptable to me, not sure what others are talking about.Action packed, well choreographed fight scenes, and good continuity. Effects that aren't too over the top, and balanced with a good story.Obviously Morbius won't top The Avengers but I'd definitely say this movie is even better than Wonder Woman 1984. Worth to watch for all Marvel fans.",

    "reviewBody": "What irritates me about the MCU is, apart from having to remember the plots & characters of 87 other films to follow any one storyline coherently, there is also a blaséness and complete lack of awe or amazement in anyone, namely civilians. Why would anything be surprising if you live in a world of superheroes, aliens & magic?That's why this movie is more watchable than other outings, as it chooses to ignore or neglect to mention its cinematic counterparts, making it more a self-contained stand alone movie. Some may scoff at the scientific creation of vampirism, discarding the mythology and lore, but one does not necessarily cancel the other.Matt Smith is quite effective in his villainous turn, and it has a certain dark atmosphere that helps, even if it may evoke similarities to other films.",

I am ranking this at a 7 because if you are new to this character and just watching it with no bais then you are going to like this movie.For action, there is a ton of it. It would have been greatly enhanced if it had been done in 3D. No sex scenes, and mild cussing, allows for children of most ages to see it. However, with the onscreen CGI transformations it may cause nightmares.This aside. The story line follows a fast paced \"jump in\" style of story telling. You feel lost in the first few scenes of the movie and then gain footing about 20 minutes in. The best scenes sadly are what is shown in the trailers. That being said. There is a romantic side to this story, as many movies have. It is a man with a rare blood condition, who is above averagely smart who happens upon a formula crossing the DNA of a Vampire Bat with that of a Human, causing a hybrid al a Bruce Banner/Hulk. Dr. Michael Mobius is able to take on supernatural/superhuman abilities such as flight, sonar, and strength, as long as he feeds on a blood substitute that is slowly losing its ability for him to survive without drinking human blood.His one and only friend, a boy named Lucian \"Milo\" who happens to have the same type of blood issue as Morbius is his benefactor and pays for the controversial and state of the art treatments that leads to their mutual transformation into Vampire hybrids. And as any story arch goes, you have one who is good, and one who turns bad with the new found power. It then turns into a superhuman fight throughout new york with Morbius's love intrest getting caught up in the middle.",

    "reviewBody": "Morbius is bad. No worse than that. It is an unredeemable pile of garbage. Why? The list of reasons is lengthy, but here are a few highlights:1. Morbius is Boring: How do you make vampire superheroes boring? HOW???2. Ridiculously Inaccurate Science: It's a superhero movie, I accept garbage science and barely blink most of the time. The problem is when you mix basic facts from the real world with your fantasy science in completely ridiculous ways. For example, vampire bats are described as being capable of taking down mammals ten times their size. That is simply not what a vampire bat does at all.3. CGI: One of the worst uses of CGI in the history of the MCU. They borrowed the flight smoke effect from Harry Potter (that smoke you see when evil wizards are flying), changed the color of the smoke, and left it everywhere. Smoke trails over here. Smoke trails over there. No reason for the smoke trails, but let's just have them anyway. Notably, they don't seem to appear when vampires are seemingly teleporting between places, or being stealthy, but anytime there is a fight *bam* smoke. I can just imagine the director, \"This is a nice fight scene, but you know what it really needs? More smoke!\"4. Incomprehensible Fight Choreography: Vampire vs. Vampire fights should be amazing. They should be interesting. They should be fast and slick and filled with opportunities for clever action sequences. Instead, almost everything is left to the imagination because the camera cuts away from every blow, or the entire screen is just covered in smoke trails (MORE SMOKE), or the fight just makes no since from a physics point of view - like a slow blow somehow throws a character 40 feet across screen.5. Giant Plotholes: How did you get off the boat? Why do you not try to clear your name? Etc. Etc.And I could go on... at no point was this anything other than a train wreck.",

They discover a cure of sorts with dark consequences.This is a Sony Marvel comic book movie. I don't think it's completely bad but it's definitely not good. I don't want to mix up the comic book universes but I keep going back to The Joker saying \"Why so serious?\". This is a comic book movie in need of some fun. It doesn't have to be jokes or light silliness but I just want the audience to enjoy the film. That's what's missing here. There is no enjoyment. I don't care about this protagonist. The first hour is a long introductory first act. His CG action scenes are interesting for about five seconds but it turns into a lot of smoke and chaos signifying nothing. The writing's low point has to be the counterfeiting lab. Why is he taking over a counterfeiting lab? He's not using it to counterfeit money. He's not being a good guy arresting criminals. It would make more logic sense for him to take over an illegal drug lab. At least, a drug lab would have some of the needed equipment. I grow less forgiving of this movie with every passing thought.

It's been done too many times and nothing interesting to set this one apartLong Review:\nI grew up reading Marvel Comics including those with Morbius. He was an interesting character. Somewhat like werewolf-by-night, Morbius was a 'monster' but did not want to be.This movie got a few things right, but too many things wrong. First, vampire bats are nothing like how they're portrayed in this movie. Seriously, did the writers think that people know nothing about vampire bats? (2) How many super-fast, indestructible characters do we need in the Marvel Universe? When a character is this powerful there's absolutely no tension in the action scenes. (3) Morbius transformation into this superbeing is instantaneous. And he already knows how to use his new abilities. (4) There's just nothing to set this movie apart from 95% of the current crop of superhero movies.",

    "reviewTitle": "An Enjoyable Watch",
    "reviewBody": "Oh dear, this film didn't go down all that well, but then again I can sort of see where the critcism of it does arise. Basically it is the origin story of a Spiderman villian, but they are trying to build a film around this particular villain, but also that a number of critics feel that separating the villain from the context of the superhero that they tend to fight doesn't work. Mind you, I thought the two Venom films worked quite well, and to be honest with you, I actually quite liked this film. In fact, the rather dark nature of the film made me feel that it doesn't really sit all that well in the type of Spiderman films that I have seen.Anyway, the film is about this doctor, Michael Morbius, who has a rare blood disease which means that his body can't produce blood, so he needs a blood transfusion on a daily basis. He is introduced to a friend who also has the disease and of course they end up becoming besties (or brothers for want of a better word - and also the word that the film happens to use). So, Morbius dedicates his life to finding a cure for this condition, and he comes upon the idea of using the DNA from a vampire bat, which actually backfires and turns him into a vampire.The rest of the film is basically Morbius coming to terms with the fact that he is now a vampire, but also dealing with his brother, who has since become immesurably wealthy, but has also taken the 'cure' but has decided that because he is now a powerful vampire, he should embrace the power and dominate people, as opposed to Morbius, who doesn't really want to hurt people (and the only people that he did hurt happened to be the thugs that were on the ship where he was conducting his experiments).Mind you, considering that Morbius is supposed to be a villain, or rather an anti-hero, which is what these films are exploring, you probably can forgive the fact that the film completely trashes the lives of these characters - which is what happens here. A sort of similar thing happened in Venom, but not to the same extent. Then again, Venom was a lot more light hearted, especially with the banter between Venom and Eddy Brock. However, this film is a lot darker, and there is also a suggestion that it might not be the same universe as the Venom universe, if the end credit sequence is anything to go by.Yeah, this didn't seem to appeal to all that many people, but I personally liked it. It certainly isn't one of the greatest films that I've seen, but personally, it works reasonably well, and I enjoyed it, though I doubt I would be rushing out to watch it again.",

Why is Milo's envy of Michael not mentioned previously? What does Milo want offer Michael, death or persuasion? Why are vampires not afraid of sunlight or holy water if they are \"Living Vampires\"? No Way Home didn't explain this, so why and how is the Vulture sent to Sony universe? Normally when a movie gives me confusion instead of introspection, it's not a good movie. Honestly, I feel bad for Jared Leto, he seems to pay maximum effort on all his characters, but the movie's are simply not appreciated (except for Dallas Buyers Club). Go check this film out if you want to see some cool effects, but be ready to sleep your way through. Lastly, Sony, don't you dare do a sequel.",

    "reviewBody": "Morbius is a lax-Marvel film that doesn't have a hell of a lot going for it: especially considering it's meant to be adjacent to the Spider-Man movies even though you wouldn't know that WITHOUT its post-credits teases. They cut out almost all of the shared-universe stuff (I think there was a reference to Venom somewhere) EXCEPT for Michael Keaton's end-of-film appearance. What a letdown.As for the film itself, it tries to be an entertaining piece on its own, but so much of it is either unexplained or poorly explained, like the whole fake-blood logic and the syringe used in the final act. Some of it just DIDN'T make sense: also the character development in this film was lacking because of the pacing focusing on establishing a superhero character as opposed to letting Jared Leto give some life to a dying scientist trying to cure himself and his best friend.What does work? Morbius himself doesn't LOOK too bad (his vampire form is okay, and his ears are nicely eerie to look at, especially with those hairs), and Matt Smith makes his hammiest Doctor Who moments look downright subtle, and Jared Harris is always nice to see even when he's underused (like he is here). The film was trying to work.The bad stuff? Well, the CGI was all over the place (looking either very good or very bad), the plotting was too empty for such interesting comic book characters, and Jared Leto himself was wasted as badly as Jared Harris.Morbius tries to work in spite of everything against it, but these characters need clearer direction, less murky CG-action and less stupid writing to make these Spider-Man supporting characters interesting.Morbius gets 1.5/5 stars. This vampire doesn't suck your attention up the way he ought to.",

When the antagonist Milo (Matt Smith) is more sympathetic than the protagonist Morbius (Jared Leto) then there is something missing or perhaps wrong about this film. The specials effects are decent & I think Marvel films have almost perfected the blueprints for doing this well.It is better than the Eternals but the bar to achieving that feat is not set that high. Marvel films have set such high standards over the years/past 2 decades that the average films like this sticks out like a sore thumb. Maybe if this was a DC film then people might rave about it more so.. & would be considered a decent attempt from DC films.Also, the fact Sony made this a PG rating to attract a larger audience may be too its own detriment. It should have been r rated; see how well the blade trilogy did. It is not a vampire film without the blood!

The script and editing are all over the place and most of the special effects are a joke for a mainstream film coming out in 2022. It wouldn't be so bad if I could see there was an artistic vision, but it just happened to not be a vision that worked for me; however the issue here is that there's no artistry or vision at all. It feels like Sony just wanted to get another superhero out with as little effort as possible just to make them some money and allow them to cling to relevancy\n2) The film feels far too fast. The editing is so fast, almost to the point where cuts are put together that seem like something is missing in between. Also, nothing is ever stopped and explained at all, E.g. Why is Lucian called Milo for the whole film?? And how does he have so much money to fund all of Michael's research?? I rarely say this about a film, but this could've done with an extra 15 minutes to just give it room to breathe. I mean it literally finishes directly after the final fight scene, no coda? No ending to give a satisfying conclusion to each character arc?3) The two credits scenes are both terrible and feel so tacked on. They don't even make any sense in the context of the MCU. Between this and the No Way Home credits scene with Venom, it just feels like Sony are desperately trying to be involved in the MCU and Marvel are desperately pushing them away - it's embarrassing.",

    "reviewTitle": "Worse than the hype",
    "reviewBody": "I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life. To clarify, I'm talking about movies that actually had a budget and were at least attempting to be enjoyed. But when it comes to \"studio\" films this one easily takes the cake as the worst in my book. Why is it so bad? Well let me explain:1. Characters.Now let me get this out of the way right now, the acting in this movie is not the problem. No one's winning an Oscar for this thing, but there were also no standout, horrible actors in Morbius. Jared Leto as Michael Morbius was surprisingly mellow, and Matt Smith as the villain was weird, but it worked for what he was clearly trying to do with the character. But unfortunately no amount of Ok acting could save the mess that was these characters. Like, what in the world were the writers thinking??? The character motivations were wildly inconsistent, or downright insane throughout the entire movie! For example: throughout the movie Morbius is constantly talking about how much he values human life and how he doesn't want to kill anyone, and how he'll take his own life to prevent himself from murdering anyone. But guess what... the movie ends and he completely forgets the fact that he said he would kill himself to protect humanity! Seriously, go watch the movie and pay attention, it's clearly said and then never addressed again. It's like the writers refused to ever check their former work, they just wanted to finish the screenplay asap. And don't even get me started on the two agents in the movie. What in the world were they thinking with those two??? Every line they had was either a horribly flat joke, or one of the dumbest sentences in the entire film! I could not stand it whenever they were on the screen, they were just there to push the plot forward and diminish the intelligence of the movie-going audience.2. Inconsistencies and Dumb Contrivences.This may seem like nitpicking, but I'd call it bad writing. There were SO MANY inconsistencies in this movie that I started to wonder if they were doing it on purpose. One example is what I mentioned before about Morbius' noble statement of his intent to sacrifice himself, and then never doing that. But I think the most glaring example in my mind was when the two agents were chasing Morbius in a building. There was a giant room with a staircase that went up at least 20 stories, and Morbius used his power of flight to reach the top in seconds. He then immediately walks onto the roof and is about to jump off when out of nowhere one of the agents burst onto the roof!!!! How did he get up there that fast??? The movie very clearly showed how huge the building was and how quickly Morbius was moving, so did the agent use a teleporter? Such a ridiculous moment in the movie, and I promise you these types of things were throughout the entire runtime.3. Story.What. A. Horrible. Story. I'm no writer, but I've seen enough movies to know a good story, and this movie seems to be aggressively running away from being good. Why does everyone keep making excuses for Morbius killing the mercenaries that he had hired? Why does Matt Smith's character IMMEDIATELY turn evil with zero motivation and no foreshadowing? Why do Morbius and Bancroft kiss while she's dying when they have had ZERO romantic chemistry the whole time??? (Seriously, there was never even a hint they liked each other, except for the fact that they were both attractive people.) Why does Bancroft aggressively bite Morbius' lip and then lick his blood? Seems like a really weird thing to do during a first kiss. Why do the bats listen to Morbius and not Loxias? Is Morbius drinking real blood now? Because apparently it was on the verge of being useless, so he must have switched over from the fake stuff. If Morbius is drinking real blood now (as the movie explicitly set up to be his only option anymore), then why did he care so much that Loxias was doing the same?I could keep asking questions, but what's the point? I left Morbius genuinely wondering all of those things, but I don't think the writers were very interested in continuity or things making sense. The story is bad with a capital B, easily the worst part of the movie.4. Post credit scenes.What in the world was that??? Seriously, THAT'S the best you can do?!?!? I pray that whoever wrote the two post credits scenes never writes in Hollywood again, and I pray that whoever approved them never holds another job in the film industry. These two scenes are absolute garbage on so many levels! First of all, they are wildly inconsistent with the characters that they're portraying. Adrian Toomes is a man completely driven by his love for his family and his desire to take care of them, but when he suddenly blinks into another universe his only thought is \"I hope the food's better here\"???? Huh?!? And then Morbius himself, when he meets up with the Vulture in the desert he is just torally on board with teaming up with this random dude in a flight suit. Since when was Morbius a villain?? He tried to NOT kill the entire movie! Also, this was not as glaring of an issue during the film, but the editing in these two scenes is horrific. It's just a bunch of quick cuts stuffed together, and it comes across as extremely rushed and unsure of itself. Instead of making me excited for the multiversal crossover I was instead left with the feeling that the studio didn't really care about what was happening. If they felt so little confidence in these two characters why should I care about them myself?In the end, I know some people may disagree with my opnion and say they enjoyed this movie, and that's Ok. I praise anyone who can derive enjoyment from what I cannot, but I myself just could not get into this story no matter how hard I tried. I am usually very forgiving of movie mistakes and inconsistencies, but when it happens this much in one movie I can't ignore it. Overall, Morbius is easily the worst comic book movie of all time (Yes, I've seen Fan4stic) and on top of that, I'd say it's in contention for the worst movie I have ever seen! I hope some people out there can have fun with this movie, but I just can't find any reason to like this pile of garbage.",

I mean, there is no logical story or plot.Perhaps the director should not take the full responsibility. The corporation between Disney and Sony is pretty shaky recently, and this might disturb the filmmaking of this movie.I am not sure if Mobius is a hero or villain, or anti hero. I am not so sure what I watched. I usually stand in the neutral position to write film reviews, but this movie's negativity is too much that I could not find anything positive to write about. I also do mind that if miss any details when I watch movies in the theaters and I rather to hold my piss, but halfway through the film, I was like, nah, I know what is gonna happen, let me take a break and do the number 1 and come back, I am not going to miss anything anyway.",

    "reviewBody": "There's just a few things I don't understand about superhero movies, some sort of \"Hollywood rules\" the first one being why does it always need the complete origin story? Think back to the X-Men, what made those movies so great? No origin stories, except for the movies they made that where especially for that. There they where, just being superheroes. Why not do the origin like a short flashback sorta montage like they often do in the comics? Second off you take Venom and Venom 2 even, they're always up to someone with the exact same identical powers. Why? I have no earthly idea. Part of what makes the hero so special is that he has these powers, put him up against any of the million villains Marvel has, make it otherwise challenging for the hero by having a very specific villain with a power thats hard for them to beat and they need to use their wits. If it had been up to me I would have made this another Spider-man movie and set Morbius up against him, it would have made it so much more interesting since Morbius technically isn't a villain but due to his ailment acts like one. Those where always the most amazing Spidey stories. I also feel Morbius as a character just doesn't have what it takes to carry an entire movie, and this is proof of that. Not due to Jared Leto's acting mind you, which was great as always he gave it his absolute best.For the ridiculous 3 years wait i'd have to say I expected so much more. I wish I could give this movie a rave review but i'm sorry, I just can't.",

    "reviewTitle": "Morbius (2022, Daniel Espinosa) Sony tries to fill out their live action Spiderverse, but this origin story is incredibly basic",
    "reviewBody": "Sony doesn't really have anything on Disney/Marvel's MCU level that they can leverage into a legitimate expanded universe, but what they do have, for the most part, is Spider-Man, and apparently all the characters that exist in the Spider-Man comics. Armed with that information and fresh off the success of both the Tom Holland Spider flicks (which are sort of MCU/Sony hybrids) and 'Venom' Sony is attempting to establish a live action Spider-verse expanded universe. With that Jared Leto takes up the lead role in 'Morbius' who is a vampire and, I believe, a Spider-Man antagonist. I will admit to not having an extreme depth of knowledge in the lore and lineage of Spider-Man's rogues gallery therefore I can only confine my thoughts to what Sony actually put on screen. Daniel Espinosa, who previoiusly directed the film 'Life', was tapped to helm after Sony failed to convince Antoine Fuqua or F. Gary Gray to direct. Jared Leto appears in the lead role with prominent supporting roles going to Matt Smith, Jared Harris and Adria Arjona. This fits solidly into the origin story superhero genre.We are introduced to a 10 year old Michael Morbius who has an incurable blood disease and is living in a hospital/orphanage in Greece. He goes through friends at such a high rate that he just takes to calling them Milo. The latest Milo, actually Lucien, sticks around a while and becomes Michael's lifelong friend, played as an adult by Matt Smith. The hospital director Nicholas, played by Jared Harris, becomes a proxy father to them both. Michael is brilliant and invents a synthetic blood that changes the world and even wins him a Nobel prize. He is driven on a quest to cure his and thereby his friend Milo's disease. This leads him to some very risky propositions in an effort to push medicine forward before he succumbs. He captures a bunch of very specific vampire bats in Costa Rica and eventually has success splicing their genes along with that of a humans which he thinks will cure him. He uses himself as a guinea pig and the results, as you can plainly see, cause him to become a vampire. He realizes that while this \"cure\" gives him superhuman abilities it comes with a desire for blood. Conveniently the synthetic blood can stop him from feasting on humans, but soon humans around him start dying, drained of blood and he is wondering if his vampire alter ego is taking control. Come to find out his bestie, without the moral qualms of a doctor, has filched this serum and is rampaging as an unabashed bloodsucker loving his new found power, and it is up to Morbius to stop him before it is too late.This film was widely panned by both fans and critics. I did not hate the general concept and I thought the special effects were decent despite some trashing them. They were much better than I thought they would be. The problem is you're taking an antagonist who is a vampire, which is antithetical to being human and a doctor, and you are devising a way to keep him as the good guy rather than treating him as a bad guy or even as an antihero. Really this film wants him to be a genuine hero attempting to make a lot of right decisions in a situation that is nothing but wrong. Like I said not knowing anything about the character I do not know how the comic book handles any of this, and honestly I don't really care to delve into it so I am uncertain on whether or not he is just a Spider-Man bad guy or an antihero of some sort or some other cross-pollination of these concepts. Here though what they try to do with him fails to some degree. Really, more than the failure of Leto's Morbius, is the complete bungling of the film's antagonist role. Matt Smith is set up as the best friend who caves in to his inner bestial mentality when he takes the serum and becomes a vampire now setting him up at odds with his life long friend. There was a miniscule attempt to set this up, however, it is completely foreseeable from predicable plot standpoint. It was so incredibly basic and lazy storytelling and, to me, it is the movie's greatest flaw. While many call this movie complete trash I would not go that far. I think there is some mild entertainment here to be had, but the movie is still far from good, and while it attempts to set up future films in this Sony Spider-verse world I find it hard to believe, given the generally negative reception, that this character, or at least Leto's version of it, will be featured in any future projects.Eric's Grade: C-",

The whole reveal that he also became a vampire is fantastic and i love all of it.Jared Leto does a great job and in better companies hands i think he can do a great job with the character of Morbius. I HOPE we see his return to this character.The rest of the cast is also fantastic and i thought those choices were greatanother fantastic thing about this film was its visual affects! All the way the powers look to us was fantastic and i love the use of echo locationbut i really thought that the action was sub par here. It was fine, but it was a lot of slow motion or too fast moving camera's to know what was going oni also thought that we had an ending to this film set up, and they completely disregarded what was set up and the film just ended after Milo was killed.Michael Keaton was a huge disappointment in the film and i'm not excited whatsoever for the sinister six set up.The post credit scenes (there are two) are garbage and the script was awful in them.All in all, there are bits and pieces that you can enjoy about the film but i would never watch this film again.",

    "reviewTitle": "This sucks.",
    "reviewBody": "So I watched Morbius out of curiosity, I've never cared much about the character when reading comics but it left me wondering if the writers actively hated the character.His origin was quick and simple enough, rare condition, needs replacement blood three times a day. Okay it's ludicrous, but whatever sets the premise. Revealing that he's a gigantic douchebag early on doesn't help me sympathize with him. Why is he such a douchebag? Because not only does he refuse a nobel prize (which would have only helped his cause and paid for his research) but he insists on calling Lucien 'Milo' like a jerk, reminding his supposed friend that Lucien is just filling another person's space until he dies and a new Milo comes in. That's cold enough, but worse - EVERYONE calls Lucien 'Milo' for the rest of the movie, including Dr. Nicholas. No wonder Lucien goes the villain route right outta the gate.So after refusing the Nobel and the million dollar prize, the now desperate Michael Morbius goes the mad science route and conducts illegal experiments in international waters where after nearly 200 failures he creates a 'cure' which goes wrong. Naturally this happens - it's a comic book movie.Moving on.For some reason the DNA of vampire bats gives him blood thirst, super strength, speed and a vapor trail... Oh yeah and has super hearing (the really kooky kind that lets him pick out a single voice or even a heartbeat in a city of millions) and can fly along on sound waves... you know... like a bat... The vapor trail thing bothered me from the beginning, it seemed to be associated with sound but in a weird way since it didn't move like sound wave but acted more like smoke. It seems to exist solely to look cool in a trailer.Lucien/Milo stumbles onto Morbius and sees what he's done to himself and immediately decides 'I want me some of that gruesome and painful looking cure!'. I get that he sees any chance as being better than his current state, but wow. Maybe he should have waited a day or two to see how turning into a blood sucking monster worked out before signing up for the early access?I won't bother the many many factual errors since that would take too long. Instead I'll complain about how Morbius gripes about not wanting to drink human blood despite the fact that donated blood works just fine as does drinking from the dead (which he does).Oh and in the end it turns out he can summon bats too, you know because he can yell...The symbolism is a bit in-your-face, although not Catwoman levels, but still things like all the red/green stuff including Milo murdering Martine on a skylight divided into the colors, and 'staking' Lucien/Milo with the vampire killing syringe in the heart.Then there was the 'turning' shot at the end which begs the question, how many more of Lucian's victims will be blood crazed vampires by morning? Also can the bitten turn others? If so the city should be 50% vampire in about a week.If the writers had decided to go with a more supernatural theme instead of trying to make this into mad science horror film, it would have at least made all the powers make a bit more sense or at least seemed less arbitrary.A few other things that bothered me were the various cribs from other movies. Some were obvious like the line from The Incredible Hulk, the recreation of the mercs/military being stalked from the same movie, and the Batman/Venom joke. While others are less so, such as the notes from 'Dies Irae' to emulate the Batman Begins theme when Morbius steps into the chamber of bats and Lucien/Milo acting like Kiefer Sutherland's David character from the Lost Boys, while dressing like Stanley Ipkiss in the Mask...Anyway then we get to the post credits -\nWTF? Why is Toomes in the Sony 'Stuff That is Sort Of Related to the Spider-Verse' now? If it's because he knew Peter Parker is Spider-man then why isn't MJ, Ned, and most of NYC there too? Where did he get a new Vulture suit? The Tinkerer built all his stuff in Homecoming using stolen alien tech which doesn't exist in this reality Toomes had no idea how to build it. Also is he wanting to hunt Spider-man now? Or is he trying to form a Thunderbolts kind of thing with people who morally gray? The Homecoming Vulture was just trying to make money and didn't want unnecessary violence or to call attention to himself.Something tells me we are unlikely to get any answers from the first Marvel (not MCU) movie to flop twice at the box office.",

Frantic and disorienting cinematography that makes you wonder what is even happening.Jared Leto drags this bloating corpse of a movie across the finish line from start to finish. You did a great job.\"From an aesthetic perspective, he fits the bill. A meek, sickly Doctor with a bad boy side. Unfortunately, as soon as he opens his mouth, it all flies out of the window. Adria Arjona does a decent job portraying the kind, intelligent Martine Bancroft but she's there so someone can tell Morbius about how he needs to, \"keep his humanity\" and that \"this isn't him.\" Matt Smith outright should not have been cast in this movie. His acting comes off as more parody than theatrical. Add in the questionable design choices of the CGI and a lot of scenes are uncomfortable to watch.This movie lacks depth on all fronts and is a mess in the same way a dumpster fire or a traffic collision is. A terrible event that is impossible to look away from. The ending and final fight scene happens with little fanfare. Plagued by the problems I mentioned earlier, it is microcosm for the entire movie. It comes and goes before you know it, leaving you asking, \"That was it?.\"It signals in some way, the end of CBM's reign of terror over the movie industry. It tries to do everything films like Endgame, Infinity War & Far From Home achieved, yet accomplishes nothing. It is an historical flop of a movie.The only reason to watch it is to say you were there when this all happened.",

The villain literally does not have any motivation; he's just being horrible only because he can, which begs the question; why did Morbius not realize that his friend is a terrible person before?Also, Morbius kills 20 guys in the beginning and then pretends that he is still a good guy.

    "reviewBody": "You should believe the reviews.Unlike the new Batman, where from the very first scene I was hooked and stayed that way through the whole thing, (And it was long. People said it was boring and dragged on, but this felt 100% longer and it was only 103 minutes I believe) with this movie by the half hour mark I was hoping it would end soon.The beginning absolutely sails through the introductions, with the first scene being a CGI helicopter landing on a CGI ledge with CGI water flowing into a CGI cave. Jared Leto gets out of the helicopter, cuts his hand open and bats fly and attach themselves to him right away.... Then it cuts to him and his friend as children in a hospital a long time ago, and within a single introductory conversation switches between several different locations of them sitting around and doing different things in different times/places having the same conversation. Then it switches to Jared Leto becoming a doctor, and then him working in a hospital, and then him coming up with a cure for his disease, explaining how he's doing it and then the trial is successful and he has a cure! Let me remind you, this is all the very beginning of the movie... 'rushed' isn't even the correct word. At this point the script was nothing but keywords.I had issues with no one being able to really describe the movie, and now I understand why; there's nothing to talk about. Things just become the way they are with no proper explanation.A perfect example and probably the only one you'll need: Tyrese Gibson is chasing Leto through a 20-something story building. The center of the building is open so Leto FLIES to the roof of the building, leaving Tyrese on the bottom floor. He gets to the top and almost falls over the edge, and who is up there with him?! TYRESE GIBSON. My husband and I said, maybe he's a vampire too??No! No he isn't! The movie ends with no purpose to him whatsoever and he is most definitely not a vampire and could not possibly find a bullet-train elevator to reach the top of the building at the same speed as someone who FLEW! (If there is an explanation for this please forgive me)And then there's the \"best friend forever\" Milo. These two sat in the park together and had one conversation and we're expected to believe they have this unbreakable bond. Jared Leto takes the serum he designed on a ship in the middle of the ocean with many procedures in place to cure himself, (and ends up diving off the ship after he murders everyone and swimming all the way back to his hospital on the mainland like he's also a vampire speed-boat, apparently?) and yet his friend Milo somehow gets ahold of his serum and injects himself with it and becomes super powerful all behind the scenes with absolutely no explanation. From then on he spends the rest of the movie harassing Leto into \"joining him\"....to which Leto just keeps trying to ditch him like an annoying younger brother. Either that or they activity try to kill each other multiple times. You know, like best friends always do! Oh well. It doesn't hurt their feelings at all. In fact, nothing much does. Who is Milo anyway? Just some dude with a disease, no matter...And through all this and without anything to do in the movie, the elderly doctor who helped them as young children remains the same age even though the children grow into men in their mid-thirties. He's also not a vampire, mind you. He just does a lot of Pilates to stay young, probably...There's so much to talk about. I feel like I need a drink, a nap and something good to watch. So yes, believe the reviews. It is actually not good. But if you enjoy it, please enjoy it without shame.",

    "reviewBody": "What's there to say about Pulp Fiction that hasn't already been said..... Multiple tales of crime and corruption and robbery put together to create what seemingly is 3 or 4 short films that are interwoven, but done so in a way that just works so well.Shot in and around LA, every actor in this movie plays their role to absolute spot on perfection. No one feels out of place or out of character for one second of this film, and there are some serious big name actors in this considering it was only Tarantino's second film. even HE himself plays a very believable role.The only downside is sensitive folk might find it a bit gnarly hearing white people use the \"N\" word with sustained use, but it's certainly nothing that ruins the film to the state of it being unwatchable.Pulp Fiction has an awe inspiring cult following and so it should. It's just the perfect movie from the 90's. It's one of those rare gems that just has EVERYTHING on display you could ever want in a film. It doesn't feel outdated and it doesn't feel overacted. It's a little bit of a long one at 2 and a half hours long but you really don't notice it because you enjoy it so much.10/10 Could watch it endlessly and never get bored.",

    "reviewBody": "If you think \"Pulp Fiction\" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is \"cool\", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.",

    "reviewBody": "Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though.Still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I'd failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I've ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I'd seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.Since then I've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.Spoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it.One of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.This collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.Now, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? Tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson's best performance, one of Bruce Willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?As I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.So instead, I'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.Pulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy's house and consult \"The Wolf\" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive.But in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.Not a shot is fired. No one is killed. It's an absolutely beautiful scene.It may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a \"Wild Bunch-esque\" ending, but instead he refrained, and I'm glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that's why it's my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.If you've never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it.\nAnd if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again.",

It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography.Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities.The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better.There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.",

    "reviewTitle": "Still perfect",
    "reviewBody": "There are movies and then there are forces of pop culture nature. Pulp Fiction is just such a film. While so much before influenced it, nothing after would ever be the same. In its wake, so many films tried to xerox its non-linear narrative, ultraviolence and wildly veering plot points. Pretty much not a single one of them is halfway decent by comparison.Tarantino took some scenes that Roger Avery intended for True Romance and decided that none of the film would appear in true order. For many, it was the first film they had ever watched that had monologues and conversations that were at the same time about everything and nothing all at once. While TriStar Pictures turned down the film, it became the first movie that Miramax would fully finance.Why would TriStar not want to make this film, particularly after Tarantino had become so big after Reservoir Dogs? Roger Avary said that the studio had issues with nearly every part of the movie, as they basically said, \"This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent and unfilmable.\"I wonder how the person that said that felt after Pulp Fiction was voted as the winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for seven Oscars. Obviously, this film was also a commercial success, remaking the career of John Travolta and causing people to take notice of the acting skills of Uma Thurman and Samuel Jackson.There's a moment in this film that determines whether or not you like and understand Tarantino. Before they enter Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia Wallace (Thurman) asks if Vincent Vega (Travolta) is square and she illustrates that point with her fingers. Suddenly, the movie becomes animated and dashed lines illustrate her point and realism fades away. In this small moment, you either think that this is the dumbest thing you've ever seen, totally pretentious or completely and utterly awesome. I fall into the latter category and began cheering the moment it happened on screen.Pulp Fiction begins with a diner being held up by Ringo (Tim Roth, who was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer, So I Married an Axe Murderer) before we move into Jules Winnfield (Jackson) and Vega (Travolta, in a role originally intended for Michael Madsen, who had played the other Vega brother, Mr. Blonde, in Reservoir Dogs) taking a briefcase back for their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames, Con Air), after a long discussion of what McDonald's calls their food in Europe.What's in that briefcase? All that we learn is that the lock for it is 666, but it's a MacGuffin - a term invented by English screenwriter Angus MacPhail and popularized by Alfred Hitchcock. The case was originally going to have diamonds in it, but that's kind of boring. Instead, it opens to have a strange glow. Tarantino has been very coy about what it really is, even doing an interview with his friend Robert Rodriguez where they cut out the real answer before his fellow Grindhouse director says that the knowledge of what is really in the case radically changed how he saw the film.There are plenty of theories of what's really in that case. If we extrapolate that Tarantino was influenced by Kiss Me Deadly, then it's a nuclear device. It's been compared to the trunk in Repo Man. And an internet rumor began that it's really Marcellus Wallace's soul as evidenced by the band-aid on the back of his neck which is supposedly where the Egyptians believed the soul resided.The two bring the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus, but first, he bribes Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to do the job in his next match. Then, the boss goes out of town but asks Vega to show his wife a nice time. How nice of a time? After all, he threw a man out a window just for giving her a foot massage.About feet - this is the movie where Tarantino reveals his foot fetish. I'm not being rude or sly; it's 100% obvious upon watching the film.Before the date, Vega buys heroin from Lance (Eric Stoltz), who is out of balloons, so he puts it in a baggie. This will be important after the date of dinner and dancing at the aforementioned 1950's pop culture diner Jack Rabbit Slim's. Their dance scene here - taken almost move from move from Fellini's 8 1/2 scene where Barbara Steele dances with Mario Pisu - is more than just a simple physical scene. For a moment in time, it freezes reality and makes us think back to why we love Travolta the actor and not just Vincent the character that he is portraying. When we see him, we don't just see every role that he has ever played. We are fixated on the role that we first fell in love with, Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever, bringing back fond thoughts of what it was like when to see the actor on the dance floor.Vega is obviously enamored of Mia and feels that things could feel the same with her, so he plans on simply leaving. However, she snorts the heroin - thinking it's coke - and nearly dies. It takes a needle of adrenaline right to her heart to fix things, as much as they can be fixed.While all this is going on, Butch wins the fight and kills his opponent. As he escapes in a taxi, its driver (Pittsburgh native Angela Jones, who graduated from the same college that I did, Point Park, and would go on to play the same character in the film Curdled, as well as date Slash) asks him what it's like to kill a man.Butch has told his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros, who was Anais Nin in Henry and June) to get everything ready to run away, but she forgot his gold watch, which we learn his father smuggled in a very uncomfortable place, along with Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who tells him the story of the watch in a flashback. Butch must go back home, where he encounters Vega reading Modesty Blaise on the toilet. One barrage of bullets later and he's on the run, but when Marcellus Wallace crosses his path, he decides to hit him with his car.Both injured, Marcellus begins shooting at Butch, who runs into a pawnshop. Maynard (Duane Whitaker, one of the racist cops in Tales From the Hood), the owner, ends up taking both by gunpoint and ties them up in a room where his partner Zed (Peter Greene, who was in The Mask) takes Marcellus from behind while the gimp (Stephen Hibbert, who was married to Julia Sweeney at the time, who also shows up briefly as the daughter of Monster Joe; Joe was going to be played by Dick Miller, but that scene was cut) watches over Butch.Butch overpowers the man in the bondage suit and decided to go back and save his enemy, using a sword to kill Maynard while Marcellus grabs a shotgun and shoots Zed, wounding him just enough so that he can call some of his worst men to get revenge. They agree that Butch can leave, but can never come back to Los Angeles. He grabs Zed's bike, gets his girl - who really has caused so much of this mess because she acts like a child - and gets out of town.Why does Butch save the man who made his life hell? Because in Tarantino's mashup universe, protagonists live in the symbolic universe of the Japanese samurai, where honor is more important than anything. Leaving Marcellus to have his manhood further destroyed and then killed isn't the death that a warrior deserves. It's no accident that of the weapons offered, which also include a hammer, a chainsaw and a bat, he takes the sword.Back in time, as they get the briefcase, Jules and Vincent surviving an attack at Brett's apartment when a man somehow misses them every single time. They argue over whether this was a miracle or not, which leads to Vincent accidentally shooting Marvin (Phil LaMarr, the voice of Green Lantern John Stewart on the Justice League cartoons). They decide to visit Jules' friend Jimmie (Tarantino), who is stressed about his wife coming home from work. That means that the cleaner, Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel), must come and do his work by disposing of the evidence.That issue dealt with, the dup come back to the diner at the beginning of the film. Jules decides that he's going to retire and walk the earth like Kane from Kung Fu, which Vincent finds ridiculous. As he goes to the bathroom, the couple we met earlier start to rob the place. Vincent returns and this leads to a Mexican standoff, but Jules successfully uses his newfound love of peace to diffuse the situation and everyone leaves alive.The Bible passage that Jules quotes isn't exactly from the Good Book. It's more paraphrased and also harkens back to the lessons that Sonny Chiba would deliver before vanquishing evil in his films.Pulp Fiction got its start as a trilogy that would be written by Avery and Tarantino, but would also have a third director. It was inspired by Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which is another portmanteau film. Tarantino's original story, Black Mask, ended up becoming Reservoir Dogs. Avery's story Pandemonium Reigns is the gold watch story within this film.There's no score to the film, but instead a pastiche of near underground American music. There's a ton of surf rock in this film, as Tarantino felt that it sounded like the themes of Italian spaghetti westerns.This is also the beginning of the incredibly self-referential universe of Tarantino films. Vincent Vega and Mr. Blonde being brothers, Red Apple cigarettes and Big Kahuna burgers show up in many of his films and Mia Wallace's TV pilot Fox Force Five is either a tease for Kill Bill or places that film as a fictionalized part of an overall narrative. For kids that grew up reading comic books or loving when TV shows crossed over, this would become an entirely new obsession. Throw in the fact that this movie references every movie that came before it and you get the reason why we're devoting an entire week to these films.Pulp Fiction is 25 years old this year. It doesn't feel that way. It achieves that rarest of movie dreams - utter timelessness.",

    "reviewBody": "Quentin Tarantino made a nice splash with his cinematic debut of directing Reservoir Dogs. And less than five years later, he followed up with another wonderful non-linear masterpiece that not only lived up to the previous films performance, but outshined it as well, appropriately called Pulp Fiction.Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction is not for everyone. There is an incredible amount of cussing and swearing as well as violence and disturbing imagery. There are some callbacks to the style of Reservoir Dogs as well with the violence, like not showing the violent boxing match that is the main point of Bruce Willis' character's story in the film is definitely a callback to Tarantino not showing the botched diamond robbery in Reservoir Dogs. Some of the scenes of violence are so out there, though, that they are almost like R-Rated scenes from a Three Stooges short, most notably the scene where Uma Thurman needs to be revived from overdosing on Heroin. However, don't expect such comedical style all the time, since there is that one scene with Bruce and Ving that is like Deliverance was directed by Eli Roth.As usual, the casting choices of the film are spot-on. Ving Rhames, who I really only have seen else in the Mission Impossible films, plays a great, tough, and much more likable gangster than Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs. John Travolta's character, despite doing a great dance scene, plays a pretty despicable bonehead who gets his comeuppance in a nice satisfying way of gallows humor. The true star is Samuel L. Jackson, playing a good-natured and loyal gangster who, following a slightly botched job, gets a better view of his violent life and decides to get his act together. The cameos are, as usual, really cool, also. Bruce Willis plays an okay tough guy in this one also, though his tantrum when he loses his watch is a little out of control. I mean, I agree that the watch is critically important to his character, but he didn't have to blow up at his girlfriend like that...And of course, the soundtrack rocks.",

    "reviewBody": "Grade: A +Is it a redemption story? If so, of human nature, or the characters themselves? A simple buddy film where action and comedy is spliced together? HELL NO!! This film has a left mark ever since I saw it. It was so different, so humorous, and yet so moving. All of this in one genre that is in itself truly hard to define.Tarantino has truly written a masterpiece. This film in reality tells three stories, which one such as myself, upon first viewing, found confusing. What can I say; it was my first Tarantino film! But after watching it several times, as I have also done, it really starts to hit you. Simply said, it really is a redemption story. Our characters are hit men, drug dealers and proud users and crime bosses. They make a living off killing and sin. So, in essence they are the \"bad guys\". And yet the audience is drawn to them due to the comedy they use. The dialogue is so rich and original we get to see two hit men talk freely about foot massages right before busting a mission, and yet it isn't regarded as silly. What other film can do that; none!In fact, it is these moments that give \"Pulp Fiction\" that flame. Perhaps the best example of this savior of the human soul theme is Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules. His performance is probably the most vivid in the movie. Every line he utters is a testament to what Tarantino envisioned. The human soul is a vile corrupt thing, but it can be reformed. It can be saved. But one has to be willing to make that change. Many times it takes a miracle for us to realize that and to make a change. It can even be our destiny to save the souls of others, as the final scene depicts with Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). There are cruel consequences that fate can play against those who refuse their destiny, as the tragic case with Vincent's death.The cast is spectacular. John Travolta and Uma Thurman (Mia) have a genius yet troubled 'love-story', twisted with temptation. Christopher Walken appears as Captain Koons and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace. My favorite actor besides Samuel L. Jackson has got to be Harvey Keitel, who is known only as the Wolf. Every actor brings a different emotion to the film, really spicing it up and making it a varied film.One of my personal Top 15 films ever, \"Pulp Fiction\" is widely entertain and will invoke the curiosity of movie goers for years to come.",

    "reviewBody": "Vincent had to take the wife of the boss out and do whatever she'd want. They went to dine out and won the trophy for the dancing competition. Back home she tried the coke Vincent just got and overdosed. Vincent drove to the dealer house and he had to inject the adrenaline shot into her chest and she woke up and they came back and promised it'd be their secret. Butch the boxer cheated the boss and killed his opponent at the match and went to his girlfriend fabienne with an exotic Colombian cab driver. They had fun and in the morning he had to get back to their flat before escaping because fabienne forgot his fathers watch. At their flat he just saw a gun with a silencer in the kitchen and Vincent came out of the bathroom and he shot him dead and left. On his way back to the motel he saw the boss by the lights and hit him and had an accident. Butch took a refuge in a guitar shop and the boss came after and the owner dominated them and called a friend over and they turned out to be some sick guys into bondage and rape. One of them raped the boss while their slave was watching butch. Butch untied himself and knocked the slave out and wanted to run away but turned back and killed one of the guys with a sword and the boss shot the rapist in the crotch and would call people over to torture him to death. He also wanted butch to leave town that day and they're fine. With the chopper in front of the store he got back to fabienne and they left the motel. It was even better than what I expected it to be. When they killed the young men who stole from their boss Vincent and Jules killed the guy that tried to kill them but failed miserably and Jules thought it was divine intervention. They spare the black guys life and took him with them. Vincent accidentally shot the guy in the face and stained the car. They went over to jimmys house (Tarantino) and their boss sent Winston to help them out. They cleaned the car, they were washed naked and wore jimmys tshirts and shorts. At the coffee shop the couple wanted to rob the restaurant while they were having breakfast and Vincent was at the bathroom. Jules wanted to quit the job because he felt gods touch when they miraculously missed the bullets of the giant pistol. Jules said he tries hard to be the shepherd and repeated the quotation from the Bible confessing he's no idea what it's about. He didn't killed them and let them leave with the customer wallets and his money except for his wallet. I can't tell how almost 3 hours passed. I will definitely watch it again",

It could make sense because everyone is just in shock of what it is and many ask, \"Is that what I think it is?\" If you want to watch something on HBO Max that is really good, watch Pulp Fiction. 10/19, Fun and I highly recommend this.",

    "reviewBody": "While watching, I was about half into the movie, I thought: Ok, now I get why everyone loves this movie so much. It's funny and the situations are so absurdly entertaining. I kept thinking: Damn, I am so excited for that ending, which brings everything together and makes sense of it all.But it doesn't come. We just get a timejump to inbetween the story, showing us how to get away with murder and that continues the robbery from the start, this time with full context. But to what result? None. It has no influence on the movie whatsoever. And it wasn't the most interesting scene aswell.\nOne could argue that, had it not been for that \"miracle\" moment that we see in the flashback, and Jackson's characters decision to retire from the job, they would've both been in the boxers appartment, which means that the boxer would've died, and many of the other stuff would not have happened. And that IS pretty genius and really cool.Then again, there is stuff that was cool to watch, but that had really no influence on the movie as far as I can see. The whole sequence with Travolta and Thurman for example. It was fun to watch, because of Tarantinos awesome style for dialogue and stuff, but it didn't really add to the overall story.One could argue, that this movie is plotless, but I wouldn't go that far.It is very original and genius in some aspects, in others not as much as I would've liked.Cheers",

The entire film is pointless, and I really don't care about any of the characters. The violence is gratuitous. I am not squeamish. I have watched, and, I have to admit, enjoyed Romero's \"dead\" films. It is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car. Yep, that is hilarious. The only good thing about the film is that John Travolta is in it.",

    "reviewBody": "The narrative of the whole story is ups and downs. Hold the audience's attention very well. Each character has different meanings in different stories and seems to be shaped into different personalities. From beginning to end, the characters haven't changed, but we have seen more of the characters' stories. It can be said that Quentin's understanding of the script and the lens expression has reached a certain height.In fact, from the structure of the film, it is understood by individuals. Ah, echoing from beginning to end, very powerful. Elementary school students know that the composition is echoed from beginning to end, and play in a loop. So to take this bragging, I think it is insulting Quentin's level.When I watch this movie, I see Quentin's understanding of the characters. Gangs, boxing, drugs, underground culture. These things that seem far away from the lives of ordinary people have been put on the screen. The first caught the eye, but it looked vulgar. In fact, the characters have their own principles and abacus. No bad guy is stupid, and no policeman is just.So the whole movie has a lot of dialogue. Dialogue is an important code for explaining information, and it is also an important way for the audience to understand the characters. So Quentin worked hard on the conversation, the conversation in the restaurant, the conversation in the car, the conversation during the murder, etc. All dialogues are expressing the character's character, and not only the dialogue is used to express the speaker's character, but also the dialogue is used to shape the character of a character who has not yet appeared. All these conversations endow the characters with soul. It so happens that they are all interesting souls. In the real world, there are many people who are lonely, and there are few interesting souls. So, how attractive should these people on the screen be to us. And the weird advancement in the story doesn't seem reasonable. But after understanding the dialogue information, all these non-common senses seem to be explained. After all, there are few normal people. It can be said that they are all weird characters. The weird director made great works again.In the end, for the audience, we are all passers-by in the restaurant. We eat in the restaurant while enjoying these stories away from life. The most indispensable group in the world is the group that eats melons. In particular, the more fresh the story, the more we cannot bear our curiosity, and the more I want to know what will happen next.Of course, this is just the appeal of the story. The story comes from the script, so I say the script of this movie is great. Quentin's grasp of the rhythm and structure of the film is excellent. Only under the combined effect of the two, did this excellent work.In short, is the story too exciting, or are we living too ordinary.Like a lonely ant, peeping into the sparrow's eyes.",

    "reviewBody": "This is worth seeing 1-2 times as it was fresh and innovative when it came out 10+ years ago. Tarantino certainly can write terrific dialogue. Walken, Roth and a couple of others are good. There are some beautiful scenes eg. the dance contest.By the time he got to Pulp Fiction, Tarantino had become self-conscious and, more important, had fooled himself into thinking that he had something deep to convey.Pulp Fiction is all hip and clever and fast and cool. It - any Tarantino movie really - laughs at movie conventions, characters, plots, story lines, scenes, and acting itself. In this he's following Burt Reynolds, who parodied his own roles and laughed at his own movies until he himself became a joke.When you watch Pulp Fiction you either buy into it or you don't. If you buy in, it's probably awesome (or at least better than the Kill Bill cr*p). But if you stand back a little bit it's just Hollywood behind an ultra-hip mask and like TV: slick & glossy but paper thin.After hearing much about this, we saw it not long after it came out. Easily the biggest disappointment ever in actual:hype ratio. This movie should rate 6/10 but is downgraded because of raised expectations.In complaining about it, a friend explained that to truly appreciate Pulp Fiction you had to understand that the briefcase contained Marsellus Wallace's soul, and that Jackson was an angel, and various other important insights.That's it then: as with any great movie, it just needed to be explained.",

    "reviewBody": "The comments for \"Pulp Fiction\" generally fall into one of three categories: 1) \"Awesome Dude! The best movie ever!\" raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on \"Friday the 13th\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.\nI had read about \"Reservoir Dogs\" (but not seen it) when \"Pulp\" was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Seven\" are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of \"Pulp\". I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that \"Pulp Fiction\" has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (\"Rashomon\"), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (\"Scarface\", for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk.",

    "reviewBody": "It seems to be the fashion among film \"intelligentsia\" to give wild praise to the most incomprehensible and incoherent rubbish, sending the partly unspoken message that if you, the film-goer, do not get it, you are not smart enough to understand it. This applies to most of the oeuvre of the late Stanley Kubrick (with the exception of LOLITA, DR STRANGELOVE, and to a point A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), and it applies equally well to this odd and trashy bit of nonsense handed to us by Quentin Tarantino. To say that sitting through it was painful would be an understatement, but if that isn't bad enough, it is also incoherent and confusing (at one point the Samuel L Jackson character dies, if memory serves, only to show up alive later with no explanation given). Uma Thurman is striking to look at in that dark wig, and Travolta stretches what little acting talent he has, but I still to this day have no idea what the movie was about, and frankly, Tarantino failed to make me care very much.Like most of Kubrick's work, this film is visually striking: the color palette in particular is stunning. But at the end of the day, how a film looks means nothing unless there is some substance underneath the surface, and if there is any here, I did not see it.At the time this movie came out, the critics were falling all over themselves proclaiming that it represented a new direction for Hollywood films.

Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself \"I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here\".  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off.",

According to some ancient legends, the movie is supposedly so awesome that most of its fans lose the ability to tell us exactly why it is so darn good.One of my friends used to talk about how great Pulp Fiction was after he saw it with his stoner dad. I had of course heard positive stuff about it before, and decided to be polite and watch it when he showed up at my apartment with the DVD. We turned it off after maybe seven hours or so. Some people will say: \"but you didn't watch the last 20 minutes!!! It's the ending that is good!\". I'm sorry, but I don't have to go outside and eat dog crap to know it's bad for me.I really can't understand what's so great about it. When people talk about this piece of crap, they usually bring up the \"distoibing\" gimp scene, the fat Travolta dance or the part where the hit men accidentally blow the black guy's head off. Clap...clap...? My friend didn't even say why he liked it. He just had a blank look on his face and repeated: \"bring out the gimp, bring out the gimp\" over and over again. Okay, so the last part didn't really happen, but I bet he only liked it because his father told him it was good. But why did his father like it? Drugs? I think many people brainwash themselves into liking Tarantino movies. \"It's Tarantino, therefore it's good! It's Tarantino, therefore it's good!\" Had Tarantino made Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill or Inglorious Bastards under a pseudonym, people would just laugh and say \"what kind of Uwe Boll garbage is this?\".",

    "reviewBody": "Quentin Tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. Breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end PULP FICTION has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. As much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. PULP FICTION does just this.I liked three of the stories, but the one involving Travolta and Thurman left me cold I'm afraid. For a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. It seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (Thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. There is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either.The surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where Jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of Tarantino's genius as Jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. The story of Travolta and Jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from Harvey Keitel as the Wolf. Bruce Willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes.There's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. The cast list is a reading of '90s talent: John Travolta in his comeback film; Samuel L Jackson was relatively unheard-of then; Uma Thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; Bruce Willis lent another world-weary performance to his CV, and none the worse for it; Ving Rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; Harvey Keitel stole the show as clear-up man; Quentin Tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; Eric Stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. There are other names I miss out in the interests of space.While Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like Quarter Pounders and Big Macs instead of \"gangster stuff\" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as Travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; Willis and Rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; Thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally Roth and Plummer getting the tables turned on them. All of these moments help to make PULP FICTION an endearing slice of cinema, which I'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come.",

Because it takes the all the aspects of what makes an excellent film in my opinion. The characters are all so interesting from the smooth hit-man Vincent, the voluptuous Mia Wallace, the intense boxer Butch, the mysterious Marsellus Wallace, the criminals Honey Bunny & Pumpkin; and the greatest performance for any character; Samuel L. Jackson as the interrogate hit-man, Jules Winfield. All of the actors shined because of the fantastic screenplay Quentin Tarantino wrote to make these colorful cast of characters come to life by their dialogue that makes you glued to the screen even if what is presented ties to the non-linear narrative or not. This is best shown nearing the end when it is shown that neither Jules or Vincent are good men by any means because they go to people's houses, interrogate, and kill them without cause; but that doesn't mean that they have heart as through their hit-men skills, were able to stop two criminals from robbing a diner. That's ingenious writing as Tarantino knows that society are full of people who aren't heroes or antagonists; there is a division and altercation within cinema and reality. Coupled with throwbacks to classic films, and an unforgettable soundtrack, Pulp Fiction will remain to impress audiences and one that I and many others; will continue to enjoy for years to come.

    "reviewBody": "It must tickle Tarantino to no end to read or listen to all the self-proclaimed 'experts' who dissect and analyze every scene, shot and line; and apply their religious or mythic interpretations; then proceed to pat themselves on the back for their ingenuity. Yes...this movie is chock-full of subtexts and inside references (and plenty of homages to movies past), but the bottom line is: it's not so much original as it is combining so many elements of comedy sketches and classic Story chestnuts wrapped in some great soundtracks. And the results explode like a blast of fresh air. So just sit back and enjoy the ride!Not that there is anything new to his approach. 'Citizen Kane' (non-linear story) and 'American Graffiti' (scenes written to fit an existing soundtrack) and even 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein' (The comedy/horror movie) are just a few examples of popular re-inventions. But Tarantino's approach are more like reminders of combining many more elements of great movies (or great movie scenes) and making those reminders seem like re-inventions. Is there anything wrong with that? Not a chance! Not when the end film has so much wit, intelligence and energy. It's time for guilty pleasure!Every actor (to the small bit parts) is perfectly cast, to single one performance over another would be an unjust slight. This is not a competition of who comes off best, this is a massive group of a labor of love everyone involved must have relished (including the technicians) so that the story comes first and everyone has their chance to shine when it serves the story to do so. The direction, camera angles and editing causes the movie to unfold much like a book, which may qualify it as being a visual 'page-turner'; you can't wait to see what happens next. And just when you think the movie is going to turn right; BAM! off it goes again on another left turn. This was one of the first movies I'd had seen in a long time that I wasn't able to predict on what was going to happen next (with so many movie cliches where the hero gets violent revenge 'At The End', the hero's side-kick is killed off two-thirds of the way thru, the damsel in distress stupidly allows herself to being captured, dialogue that is 'dumbed-down' to appeal to the (so called) mass).To get the most from this entertainment, it's best to know nothing about it other than the info on the DVD jacket. To reveal ANYTHING is to rob yourself of a great movie viewing (and listening) experience. So...you won't find any lazy re-hashing of the plot in this review.The \"Collector's Edition\"('s) DTS sound is fantastic and is a huge improvement over the 5.1 Dolby Digital's earlier DVD release. If you love the movie, then you'll enjoy the wealth of bonus material.(Very subtle spoiler) Alright! I'll indulge just this once, concerning the contents of the briefcase. I don't buy the voodoo religious suggestion that the case contains the soul of Marcellous Wallace in spite of the 666 or the band-aid on the back of his neck (a happy accident for interpretation because actor Ving Rhames had a scar that needed covering). I've heard gold bricks; an Oscar; even the holy grail. I think Tarantino just put a gold glow there to create massive theories and arguments (brilliant ploy). BUT, if I had to pick: taking into account the director's love of movies, the characters' reaction and subsequent action to steal it (including Brett & party; especially Pumpkin's reaction: \"Is that what I think it is??\" which Jules confirms) I wouldn't mind thinking that the contents refers to the 1941 classic directed by John Huston that begins the story in 1539 of \"a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with the rarest of jewels\" and how history showed what little regard some people placed on the value of human life to gain its possession. NOW...everything fits into place! But, that's only if I HAD to pick.10 out of 10! Probably the movie of the decade.",

    "reviewBody": "This is Tarantino's absolute best work and quite simply one of the best films ever! with brilliant storytelling and incredible performances. All the characters are wonderful and very memorable, and there are plenty of surprising and shocking moments throughout, plus Samuel L. Jackson,John Travolta,Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all simply amazing in this!. The dialog is extremely intelligent and witty, and I thought the whole foot massage story was really funny, plus The opening and ending are both especially awesome. I believe this film deserves to be #9 on the top 250! and my favorite segment has to be the watch with Butch Coolidge (Willis), plus Jackson and Travolta were so awesome together and had brilliant chemistry!. The music is fantastic, and Mia's (Thurman) OD'ing scene is both disturbing and somewhat funny at the same time, plus I thought the character development was outstanding. Ving Rhames is ultra cool in his role, and this is extremely well made and written as well! plus the scene where Mia and Vincent Vega are at the diner is just fascinating!.I remember watching this when I was about 13 or 14, and thinking it was so boring, god how could I have been so stupid!, this is truly what brilliant filmaking is all about, plus all the characters are extremely likable. I personally thought Quentin Tarantino was great in his scene and it is quite violent at times, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Vincent Vega's gun accidentally goes off in the car, as I found that to be a great bit of dark humor in my opinion. Harevy Keitel's scene is a memorable one was The Wolfe, and Uma's ketchup joke was funny, plus it all feels like a Dark comedy to me!. Travolta's joke about how they call the quarter pounder with cheese in Paris was very funny and Samuel L. Jackson had some brilliant lines as well! plus I loved Eric Stolt'z character as well. This is Tarantino's absolute best work, and quite simply one of the best films ever! with brilliant storytelling and incredible performances, and if you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for? do so immediately you won't regret it trust me!.The Direction is masterful. Quentin Tarantino does a masterful job here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is incredible!. Samuel L. Jackson is amazing here, he gives quite possibly his best performance, is hilarious, had brilliant chemistry with John Travolta, had some of the coolest lines of all time, really seemed to be enjoying himself, and just gave one of a kind performance, he was amazing (Jackson Rules!!!!). John Travolta is just as good, he rejuvenated his career, with his role here, and rightfully so. his scene with Uma Thurman in the diner, was especially awesome, he also looked damn cool. (Travolta Rules!!!!). Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he played one of his coolest characters, and it was basically an action role, but damn was it a good one!,Butch was my favorite character along with Jules!, he was just perfect for Butch (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Uma Thurman also gives one of her best performances here, as the drug addicted Mia, she didn't have all that much screen time, but she made it memorable!(Thurman Rules!!!!!). Ving Rhames is excellent here as Marcellus, he was just a bad ass, and had a very cool scene with Willis!. Eric Stoltz cracked me up as Lance, he was one of the funniest characters in the film in my opinion. Christopher Walken had a cool cameo here and was great. Quentin Tarantino is actually really good as Jimmy and was quite funny. Harvey Keitel is awesome as the Wolfe as he cracked me up I loved him. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are both awesome as the robbers, and were just great. Rosanna Arquette(Jody) did what she had to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately you won't regret it. ***** out of 5",

    "reviewBody": "This film is a masterpiece in filmmaking. The Idea of taking one event and watching it from three different perspective is a genius idea on it's own, but this movie takes it a step forward by adding amazing characters and incredible dialogue. This film is a masterpiece. Some people complain about the violence, but I think that's actually a huge strength. The film isn't scared to show some blood and it represents how horrifying some of the scenarios are. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson do amazing performances as the Hit-men. Tim Roth from Reservoir Dogs is back and performs a killer performance in this film too, and of course Bruce Willis is Fantastic as he is in most of his movies. Expect for Die Hard 5, but that's another story.All in all, This film really knows how to be original is not telling a three act structure story and instead telling a very clever idea and a very clever story. But what else do you expect from one of the greatest directors of all-time, Quentin Tarantino?9.75/10",

    "reviewTitle": "blood and f****** spirituality",
    "reviewBody": "I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole \"Jules redemption-speech\" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.",

    "reviewBody": "HOLY CRAP! In my whole life I have never seen a film this good. Two hours and thirty minutes just flew by and I didn't even notice it's been an hour when the first part was over. This film left me in awe and I feel like watching it again and again and again. People say this is overrated; well it sort of deserves it! So this is all opinion and the only fact is an event in the movie. -------------------SPOILER LINE---------------- So our main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). These characters are two of the best in the whole history of film and they deserved the Oscars they got. Our villain is umm... Since there's no exact villain, this film gets the bonus. Our supporting characters are Butch (BRUCE WILLIS!), Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), Pumpkin(Tim Roth), and Marcellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). All these characters play into the film perfectly. The genre of the film is crime, black comedy, and thriller. Well there was crime, at parts I was laughing my ass off, and some parts, my heart was beating so fast. There were no boring moments in this film. The story is told out of order. We start in a Diner and end in a Diner. So I'll summarize the story in its real order. Vincent and Jules get a case containing ....... and then they accidentally kill someone in their car so they have to clean it out. Jules thinks about retiring while the diner they're eating at is held up. Jules stops the robbery and go to a bar where Vincent gets his assignment from Marcellus Wallace. He takes Mia Wallace out. She gets overdosed in drugs. And the rest is spoiling the story. So, I give Pulp Fiction, one of THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, 95% AWESOME! The highest rating so far!",

Quentin Tarantino found a way to wrap the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's into this film seamlessly and beautifully. Just an awesome movie with a great script and unexpected humor throughout. The movie is cool and it makes you want to be cool too. One thing I have noticed about Tarantino is that his movies are very cool. They make you feel like you're back in the 70's when it was OK to smoke cool. They make you feel like wearing sunglasses in doors cool.The cast was awesome. Every cast member played their role beautifully. Samuel Jackson was awesome! It was so hilarious how he ate that guy's cheese burger then drank his entire drink in the beginning of the movie before shooting him. That scene was just epic. Every scene was epic.",

    "reviewTitle": "Tarantino's Best and a Favourite of mine",
    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is great movie, Quentin Tarantino's best. It is multi-layered, having a number of stories involved in the movie. The stories involved in the movie include Vincent (John Travola) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) going out on a hit and accidentally killing a man in their car and thereby having to sort of the mess, Vincent having to entertain Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), taking her to a 50s themed restaurant and ends up taking a heroin overdose and Vincent having to save her life, Butch (Bruce Willis) crossing paths with gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and end up having to work together and a robbery of a restaurant by a couple which happens at the beginning and the end of the film.Pulp Fiction has many of the traits that make Tarantino such a good writer/director: there great dialogue and humour, there is a number of stories and Tarantino never tells a story straight (this was done in Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Kill Bill), good casting, violence and a great soundtrack. Tarantino was also not scare to look at some dark plots such as male rape and the underbelly of crime. Because of Pulp Fiction Travola's career got a kickstart (a Simpsons' joke at the time was that Travola was working a 70's themed bar), made Samuel L. Jackson a household name and got him an Oscar and help made the careers of Uma Thurman and Rhames. Because of the way the story is set out Pulp Fiction needs to be watched a number of times, which in my mind normally a good thing because it makes you think and pay attention. It also has good lines in the film, such as the Royale with Cheese conversation and good moments of comedy and dark humour. A moment I really like is when Marsellus Wallace sees Butch in a car whilst he was crossing the road. As well because of the film I have the Fun Loving Criminals' song from the film on my iPod, with the beginning of the film as well.",

Interlocking stories from the seedy side of Los Angeles include ruthless hit men, a gangster's beautiful wife with a roaming eye and a boxer who refuses to take all.Pulp Fiction is the defining film of the 1990s, playfully mixing up its chronology, packed with memorable, snappy, cute dialogue and showing a genuine zest for the art of film-making. Director Quentin Tarantino's film-literacy, learned obsessively during his stint as a video-store assistant, pays off handsomely here; almost every line is quotable, a sense of fun pervades, there's a host of delightful set-pieces (including John Travolta's and Uma Thurman's sexy dance) and generous screen time is given to characters rarely considered at length in film, such as Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's stolid hit men. Briefly, Tarantino shone brighter than anyone else in the industry, and this film justifies his accolades.",

    "reviewBody": "Do not, my fair reader, be put off by the countless jerks who already affiliated themselves to the PULP FICTION cult, and this not because there's yet some room for still more jerks to join the cult but because there is much more in PULP FICTION than what meets the mimetic jerks' eyes. On KANE there's a crust of _academism and bores' gossip, on PF there's a crust of nastiness and jerks' ineptitude. And for one thing, daddy Tarantino is a true director—the way a Lynch or the Coens are not. Now admit it, fair, lovable reader—what if PF were no more famous than Omar the Tentmaker, Old Ironsides, Tarzan and the Golden Lion, The Princess from Hoboken or The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini? Now wouldn't you cry masterpiece and claim that Tarantino is an ignored genius? I call this the GONE WITH THE WIND test—take a movie that you think is overrated and then pretend or imagine it's unknown—what would you feel? The false thesis is that it could serve as a substitute for the '70s trash classics; it will not. It's not an updating or upgrading of the '70s cult flicks.It's a treat, it's straight wonderful; the performances are gold, the script is indeed fine. It has zest, gusto, true storytelling, some awesome action and some nasty violence—and an enjoyable score.What if PULP FICTION were as famous as Isle of the Snake People or The Utah Kid? Liking this movie does not mean binding to the fashion—but acknowledging the obvious—and I do so joyfully—you can also see it as a Willis movie, that's what I did, consider PULP FICTION as primarily a Willis movie, one of Willis' most distinguished roles.",

    "reviewTitle": "An unique and extremely entertaining film.",
    "reviewBody": "For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present. Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made.Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is Vincent (John Travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is Butch (Bruce Willis) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role. The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. This film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue. Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. All story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. The film's replay value is tremendously high, I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining.Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. For example: Vincent and Jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire.The film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of, brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. The dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. This film does not want to directly take you into the action, when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping. Another example is Bruce betrayed Marsellus Wallace and killed someone, he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did. Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens.Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks.The acting is fantastic, Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules, John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well. There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch. All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles.In conclusion, I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantino's best movie.Overall: 9.5/10",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is one of those movies I liked more in retrospect than at the time. I think Tarantino's genius does play a part in this film, and the product is substantial; but Reservoir Dogs is better.All the characters use witty, random dialogue about European hamburgers and the sexual implications of foot massages, but to what avail? I mean, as fun as it is to hear and watch, I just found that the whole movie lacked something. Maybe a little bit more editing would've done the trick; maybe it was something else. I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong. I think this is a classic Tarantino movie. I enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson's quotable lines, as well as a couple of outstanding scenes. (The OD, the Big Date, the scene where Harvey Keitel gets rid of the body, etc.) As a whole, the movie does work. But some minor details would make it even better.The storyline of Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames was a little much. (Did Ving *really* have to get raped?) I know Tarantino just wanted to add some shock value to his film, but even for a person who doesn't mind that kind of thing in movies I found it a little extreme.Oh, and one more thing: I learned that \"zapateria\" means \"shoe store\" in Spanish, courtesy of Butch. ;-)HandHStudios Rating: 8/10HandHStudios",

    "reviewBody": "In one word: boring.Get the comments people make about this movie. You have those that say it's \"innovative and controversial\", others that it's \"violent and refreshing\", others that say it's a \"rebellious masterpiece\". Yes, you can check it out, absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments. Why? I have a theory: those guys have NEVER watched a good movie. And I mean it! Violence? Gosh, this movie was only less boring than \"Natural Born Killers\", the worst movie ever made (don't worry, I have a \"good\" comment prepared for that crap, also).There is only one really violent scene in the whole movie, when the pervert binds the boxer Bruce (and the other guy I can't even remember who was) and prepares to torture them. I can't remember if he actually does torture them, but that's absolutely irrelevant, the situation the characters are put into is what really matter. And Bruce choosing the sword when he escapes, oh my, that was really nice (the only good moment in the whole movie). Wanna see lots of fake blood, watch \"Happy Tree Friends\"! But do you want true violence, watch \"Spoorloos\". Paraphrasing it, if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do, you haven't seen anything yet!It's absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our \"civilization\". Okay, a murder is terrible, but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive (not only the victims, but also those around them...)\"Pulp Fiction\" is about terminating people without a good reason, nothing more. I see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless character's head (MTv's Movie Awards parody of the car scene was excellent, they really got the idea!!!) This movie only shows more fake blood than most \"hollywoodian\" movies, but what's the point? If it created a revolution in Cinema, it was to make it \"yuckier\"... I have seen much more blood in \"Hellraiser\", which, by the way, has blood AND violence! All Tarantino's movies are too shallow to show true violence...Too bad IMDb doesn't allow voting zero for a movie...",

    "reviewTitle": "\"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration?\"",
    "reviewBody": "There's just something about Pulp Fiction that makes it great. It took me a while to figure it out, but I think I found it. This may sound weird, but I think that it's the upbeat message found deep within the movie. What is so upbeat about a story involving 2 hit men (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (Bruce Willis), and a drug pusher (Writer/Director/Average-at-best Actor Quentin Tarantino)? It's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. Take the characters Vincent (Travolta, in an Oscar nominated role) and Jules (Jackson) as two under-armed hit men. After the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and \"save\" someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. The aspect of Pulp Fiction most remember is the script. Things are said by Tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. What would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. Who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where Vincent and Jules discuss hamburgers in Europe. Or the Bible verse sermonized by Jules before he goes through with business. And of course, the music selections made by Tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. It is said that Quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra \"character\" in the movie pitch-perfect. The opening credits employ the use of \"Miserlou,\" which has become synonymous with Tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. We know the Jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play \"Jungle Boogie\" in his car, and that Mia (Uma Thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing \"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\" while entertaining Vincent. This scene comes after \"Son of a Preacher Man\" welcomes Vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see Mr. Saturday Night Fever dance again. The lure to Pulp Fiction comes from the sum of the parts. The acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with Harvey Keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. The underlying sense of hope is what gives Pulp Fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s.",

    "reviewTitle": "If You Like Independent Movie, Totally You Must See Thiz Movie!",
    "reviewBody": "Thiz movie is known as the most talked about movie of the decade. The movie receives a lot of good reviews from most critics. You must see it yourself then you will understand why. \"Pulp Fiction\" is starred by many famous Actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and many more. It's directed by Quentin Tarantino who is known for his eccentric works. The plot is unusual, but very intriguing in a strange way. The script made by Tarantino himself. It's kind of confusing in the beginning, but it becomes better and better as time goes by. It moves forward and backward along the movie with attractive flashback sequences. The thing that made thiz movie so special is simply those elements. You must see it over and over to understand the idea. However, actually the plot is just an ordinary plot, but the editing made it extremely extraordinary for overall. The other factor that make thiz movie unforgettable is the dialogue. The dialogue is mostly long but colorful, rude but exciting. Thiz movie is actually made with limited budget, but it's still loaded with many big stars. Thiz has proved that the Actors know for sure there is something very special in the script. The other memorable scene that you will never forget is when the dancing scene of John Travolta and Uma Truman. The dancing is phenomenal. Most people remember Travolta for his 1980s musical movies such as \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) and \"Grease\" (1978). Today, when we see him dancing again with his present figure, you can feel in that very moment, something magical is happening. That is the fun part. If you like indie movie, you certainly must go to see thiz one.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

    "reviewTitle": "Quentin Tarantino's best movie",
    "reviewBody": "Quentin Tarantino's movies are there own genre. 25 years ago however, he was a nobody. Then he directed THIS movie, and this is what put him on the map, as one of the directors to look out for.Pulp Fiction is about a number of different characters, whose stories all intertwine together during the course of this movie. You've got the two hit men Jules Winnfield, and Vincent Vega. You've got Butch Coolidge, a boxer, whose losing his game, so to speak. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, two robbers, who appear at the start, and the end of the movie, although they technically only appear in one stage of the movie.That's one of the interesting things about this movie. It is not told in chronological order. One might think this would confuse the story, but it actually makes it more interesting.This adds to an already interesting story, but the driving force behind the movie is the dialogue. A lot of dialogue based movies can be boring, and this one is boring very occasionally. This certainly is one of the more interesting dialogue based, that keeps people interested for its 2.5 hour length. For this reason it is possibly one of the most quotable movies of all time.Considering that, and how well it is made, it is obvious, due to the content, that this movie isn't for everybody. Some people really won't like it. However anyone who likes great dialogue, will probably like it, cinema nerds (like myself) will probably like it, I certainly enjoyed most of it, and so I give it 8/10",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp fiction the movie I started hating and yet it came to be one of my favorite movies, I completely loved the originality of the film and the gorgeous dialogue the main theme the film articulates is chance and the random nature of life and how our decisions are conformed accordingly. the mantle of the film is for sure the dialogue which fleshes out the main theme and drives it forward. the best performance for sure goes for Samuel L Jackson and got the best character arc ,too. the dialogue is subtly written keeping you immersed in the film, it crafts the perspectives of the characters and their approach to life and how seriously they take the definition of redemption.\nthe narrative of the film is upside down , scattered and randomly told emphasizing the chaotic nature of life , and the unpredictable situation we may encounter, and the impact of these random situations on our perception and pursuing reconsideration when the opportunity is offered.\nthe movie doesn't attempt to avoid luck but it depends on it that is precisely the thread which make the plot tight.\nthe movie demonstrates the theme by dividing the story into four characters\nand putting them in what is supposed to be a turning point of their lives. obviously the movie raises imperative questions we arguably could relate to, could really a singular moment be sufficiently enough to persuade you to reconsider your choices? is it really random and we don't get to choose the coarse of our lives or this is just a justification? each character faced these questions differently, Mia Wallace was almost dead by overdose but she was saved by luck so she was offered a chance to redeem her spoiled life, Butch when he decided to save Wallace instead of letting him torture that settled things between them and now he gets to start over, Vincent after him and Jules miraculously dodged bullets they had controversy on perception of this situation Jules decided that it was a sign to leave his criminal life and pursue righteousness and he did so he gets to live, while Vincent who arrogantly insist to neglect the chance and not to magnify it so that gets him killed.\nthe film got minor issues not in the narrative wise but in the pacing a little bit some scenes didn't really add up something to the main theme, but other than that the movie is a masterpiece.",

    "reviewBody": "\"Pulp Fiction\" is a remarkable movie. Watching it multiple times, I take pleasure in its mischievous exploitation of tropes as well as many other playful traits. I enjoyed calling it a great Lutheran movie—as I did for many years. There is a theological core to the narrative.The sister of a former friend deeply disparaged this movie to me. She felt it is pretentious with a celebration of decadence. I think she overreacted.The grace of the film emerges in expression of the clear love of cinema embodied here. I feel indebted to Quentin Tarantino for writing, directing, and acting. I deeply admire the superb and enchanting cinematography by Andrzej Sekuła. The work of co-writer Robert Avary is clearly vital. Sally Menke's insightful and gracious editing might be the most important component though here everything works.This film deserved careful viewing and critical analysis. The cast is one of the best ever assembled for any film. There is no false note anywhere in casting. I particularly enjoy watching \"Ving\" Rhames though pointing out any actor over another here seem unfair. The same goes for favoring any sequence in the movie, but I do love \"the Bonnie situation\".Those who finally financed this masterwork showed great artistic sense. We are in their debt. In particular, one somehow knows that Quentin Tarantino is the single most important genius behind this work. His touch is everywhere. The dialogue stays with one long after initial viewing.",

    "reviewBody": "John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and a ton of others star in one of the best films of all time, Pulp fiction. The movie is brilliantly made with a ton of action, laughs, and awesomeness. Tarentino hasn't done a better film in his career. That means something, because the guy hasn't had a bad film yet in his career. I couldn't agree with IMDb more. My favorite Tarentino movies are either this or Jackie Brown, which is very underrated. Both movies have a ton of plot, laughs, and action, and a great cast. Tarentino's films make you laugh even a parts that aren't supposed to be funny. Pulp fiction is a masterpiece.The film is a story of Vincent Vega and his friend Jules, two hit men. Vincent is asked by his boss to watch his wife(Played by Uma Thurman) for a night and gets her drugged up. Or she gets herself drugged up.Jules is thinking of retiring. The two guys get into some crazy situations. Another storyline in the film involves as boxer named Butch(Played by Bruce Willis) who is being hunted down by the Marsallis Wallace(played by Ving Rhames). That is who Vincent works for. The two of them get into some pretty crazy situations. Both of these tales are intertwined in a brilliant way. I forgot to mention another story plot. There is a couple(played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob a restaurant. A smart idea I think. All of these stories are intertwined in a brilliant fashion. This movie has some memorable scenes and quotes. Pulp fiction is a real classic and the comeback of John Travolta. All of the performances are great. In Be cool, they make many references to this movie. Perhaps not many, but a few. They really didn't have to. Because those who have seen this movie sure as hell aren't going to forget it.Pulp fiction:****/****",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is definitely my favorite movie.Like every movie of Quentin Tarantino i've seen, the dialogues in this movie are of great quality. Two mobsters discussing the wonders of Amsterdam and its weed or the name of a cheeseburger in Paris makes them seem like normal people. I especially liked the discussion between Vincent and Pitt about massaging feet.What I found admirable is that a simple feature as a toilet plays a part in this movie. When Vincent and Pitt take care of Brad and his friends who messed up a deal with Marsellus Wallace their last accomplice hides in toilet. When Vincent goes to the toilet at Mia's after their date(or wasn't it a date?) Mia mistakes his heroine for cocaine and overdoses. When Vincent is done at the toilet he finds her. When Vincent goes to the toilet at the restaurant and the restaurant gets robbed.Overall, I love this movie and I think it absolutely deserves its spot among the best movies out there. Superb acting, good plot line, a must see.",

Tarantino weaves together a number of stories seamlessly, featuring gangsters and scumbags, violence and drugs, pop culture and art, and makes a perfectly coherent and enjoyable movie. The script is witty, the techniques he uses to tell the story are refreshing, The soundtrack is excellent, and used as part of the story, the dialogue is sharp but not cheesy or over the top, and the direction shows great skill and focus. Like The Godfather, and many other 'classic' films i have reviewed, there isn't much more i can say that hasn't been said before, except that this is the most recent film that has warranted that status. I still prefer Reservoir Dogs though. 9 out of 10",

    "reviewBody": "\"Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.\" Pulp Fiction has to be one of the best crafted movies of all time. Sure, it's out of order and some people (including some dear to me) got confused, but it's so well made in the sections it's presented, it deserves to be on the top of all people's best of lists.Yeah, it contains violence and a lot of it. Some language and it's excessive. And believe it or not, for being a \"guy's movie\" it contains full frontal male-nudity (thanks, Bruce.) But, it's creative, inventive, original and a helluva lot of fun.There's a dozen or more subplots to explore, but for the most part, it involves the zany adventures of Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson.) They're enlightened hit men or simply, employees of one Marsellus (Rhames) and they're on a mission to retrieve a golden briefcase. In the interim, they accidentally shoot someone, get shot or dance off with a drug addict.To be perfectly honest, despite the previous paragraph's spoilers, there's so much going on in this movie, it's hard to describe everything that happens. Needless to say, you MUST see this movie.It contains the following: excellent acting, great comebacks/tributes (Travolta and Stoltz amongst others,) wonderful dialogue, comedy, cinematography, soundtrack, score, originality and enormous breakthrough for a director/writer (Tarantino) who is likely to go down as one of the best directors/writers of all time.I have practically memorized the soundtrack and quotes. And even the joke involving tomatoes. It's rich and deserves an audience from the 1990s to present. Perhaps Tarantino didn't know what impact he would have with his \"fictional\" story. But anyone that's seen this knows what a master he was when he created this world.I have no problem for saying the following words: Alfred Hitchcock is a favorite of mine. Tarantino is drawing very near to the master Hitchcock was. As crazy as Tarantino may appear, he knows what he wants, he knows how to spin an extremely creative yarn and he doesn't seem to care if anyone else agrees. To me, I hold him in the highest respect for his visions.",

    "reviewBody": "Around the tenth time I finally learned to watch Pulp Fiction as if the film was a good comedy, though not the kindest and not quite a comedy. Basically, all this concerns the beginning with Tim Roth, a couple of Travolta - Samuel L. Jackson, very rarely I watch until the moment when Uma Thurman comes out on the dance floor. Then I twist and watch the end of the story with car laundering and philosophical conversations in a restaurant. All the same, these topics with a clock in the ass (by the way, I never remembered the name of this actor.He forever became for me the one who kept the clock in the ass for Bru Willes), the diseases of Uma Thurman, the perverted policemen - I safely skip all this ... What's new about Pulp Fiction? This skillful incendiary conceptual kitsch invigorates with something that you never admit, even to yourself. The obvious idea that a bandit is also a person, like his own son, dangerous, but dear, in American real life with a century-old tradition of gangsterism, does not seem to be something unhealthy, on the contrary, the human dignity of the same Travolta or Jackson seems normal, without any questions about some kind of law, only some other values. The film, in fact, is about the fact that everyone sets their own rules for themselves, corresponding to their capabilities and imaginations. Soundtracks have become classics, phrases from the film are common to all mankind, and Tarantino is a cult figure. I can't wait - I can't wait for his next film. And the screams of Amanda Plummer at the very beginning should be listened to only in the original.",

    "reviewTitle": "Excessive violence to cover up artistic default",
    "reviewBody": "Sam Peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films. \"Dirty Harry\" series from the same era played by Clint Eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality either.So are \"Scarface\" and \"Body Double\" of Brian Da Palma from the 1980s. In all the above however, there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical score. On the other hand, lacking the essentials of cinematography, the violence in all Quentin Tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void. A young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in \"Natural Born Killers\". One of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in \"Reservoir Dogs\". Still in this one, a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword. Still in another scene, having been shot in the groin, a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals. Now I don't see where is the fun of in all these. More important, where is the art in all these so that almost all Q.T brand films have earned such high ratings ? Apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as \"yep\", \"yeah\" , \"right\" and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks, what is the idea behind? That violence and sordidness have become an integral part of American society ? Well, after all that is their choice and they have to live with that, but at least don't sell this crap to elsewhere. If you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia/mob genre by masters such as Scorcese or Dilaurentis or Coppola, blood and gore unavoidably creeps in. However, there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous Q.T make. I might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards, but somehow I don't fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab U.S highways.",

Why does Quentin cameo in the movie? Why are there gay cops. I've seen Death Proof, and thought it was SPECTACULAR. I don't know why everyone thinks this is so great. The characters have no personality. The movie seemed like it left you to make the story full circle.

    "reviewTitle": "A Royale with cheese please!",
    "reviewBody": "An epic landmark in film making brought to you by everyone's favourite madman Mr Tarantino..., Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential films of the last thirty years and maybe of all time. Quentin Tarantino became a cinematic auteur after only his second film and lay down the yard stick for which all other directors strive to be; a completely original film like nothing seen before, revolutionary at the time and still revolutionary now, maybe more so?It non-linear form of storytelling was a masterstroke, adding something unique and dynamic to the crime story contained within, on the surface Pulp Fiction's plot would've been samey and flat if not for the magic Tarantino threw at it.On a whole other level is the dialogue, Tarantino's legacy will include his unique approach to making everlasting and brilliant dialogue, Pulp Fiction is the perfect example of realistic yet overly tongue-in-cheek usage of the spoken word. The opening scene with Jules and Vincent driving along to their next job is a shining example, talking about the most obscure and silly things like what do Europeans call a quarter pounder with cheese..., a Royale with cheese, because of the metric system, in my view this is one of the greatest quotes in cinema, stupidly simple and random but so effective.The acting is sublime and masterful, John Travolta's performance alone relaunched his career and made him an A list star once again..., it also has to be the shining light in Sam Jackson's career, he was given the ball and he ran with it truly, announcing himself to the world in the process.The side story involving Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge added another amazing dimension to an already incredible film, and Tarantino expertly linked the story in to the rest of the film like a pro.Cinematic excellence and it just goes to show how well independent films can be if you give them the chance, an independent film by a relatively unknown at the time director has gone on to become one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time and for very good reason.Essential viewing for any budding film fan, a film that must be near the top of every list..., one of the best ever, I salute you Quentin Tarantino, cinema is a better place because of you sir!",

Those bullets that missed Vincent at Marvins Apartment lol, that's karma right there. I did not expect that. Samuel L Jackson was great as well. He did keep his cool and him being in literally 100,000 movies in his career, what more can you expect from a legendary actor like Samuel. I recommend this movie 100 percent.

    "reviewBody": "I could write an entire novel reviewing this movie. So let's start off with the one negative which is likely the most common issue for those who don't like the movie. It's not action packed and it's not gory like kill bill or django. But what this story lacks in action sequences it more than makes up for with unique dialogue, completely original story (and story telling). When this movie ends and you turn off the TV it leaves one pondering about life and the choices we make. Everyone in this movie learns a lesson; whether or not they get lucky or learn them the hard way. You'll be able to sympathize or empathize with a vast majority of the characters (a few stragglers aside). The non linear chapter set up for this movie might leave one confused at first, but you have to observe each segment as their own movie then try to connect the dots (harder to do than it sounds). To this date there has not been a role that fits Sam Jackson as well as his character in this movie. And even though the last chapter is technically not the \"ending\" it works much more as such. I would not consider this an action suspense film; I would feel better calling it a very dark comedy. But if anyone reads this review all the way through and hasn't watched it yet. Do so now and even if you don't like the film you still have to appreciate its originality.",

    "reviewTitle": "Occasionally great, overall a genuinely entertaining movie",
    "reviewBody": "\"Pulp Fiction\" is an American film from 1994, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year and the director here is of course Mr. Quentin Tarantino, who made this film around the age of 30 and it was his 3rd filmmaking effort already, although most people have not really heard of his first work and only know Reservoir Dogs from his very early years. Anyway, this one here is the one that not only brought him a Palme d'Or, but also introoduced him to and kept him at the Oscars for years, no decades to come. Until this day, in fact. So lets take a look at what is most memorable about Pulp Fiction. I think last night was maybe the third time I watched this movie and the first time at a theater. It's a really long film at over 2.5 hours, but it does feel shorter for sure and that is almost a given as this film is still in the imdb top10 hightest-rated movies, currently at #8, but it was even top5 a few years ago I think. Anyway, by now it's been rated by 1.7 million voters. Enough said about the movie's popularity. So many have seen it.As for the film's success with awards bodies, I already mentioned something, but it also needs to be said that Tarantino won a Screenplay Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA for his writing and that is of course a huge trifecta achievement and he was really young back then, so truly nice that he certainly delivered in the decades afterwards. I cannot really think of one filmmaker these days around the age of 30 with such a bold unique approach to filmmaking. You can really see in almost every scene how big of a film nerd Tarantino is. And his cast here profited a lot from that too. Travolta got an Oscar nomination. He deserved it. Uma Thurman did too and I am not so sure about her. Love her in Kill Bill and recent films where she is a scene stealer with very little screen time when working with Lars von Trier, but I don't know if her performance here is really good enough for a nomination, even if I am quite fond of her in general. And then there is Samuel L. Jackson of course. Everybody who knows him (only) as Nick Fury needs to see his works with Tarantino. He is so good in here, such a memorable character, easily the best from the film. And he worked a lot with Q afterwards too. His turn in the Foxx/DiCaprio/Waltz western is also magnificent. But back to this one here: I would say basically the first scene when he and Travolta enter the apartment is when the film is at its best. Judging from this one only, I would have given 4 stars out of 5 and said it is one of my favorite films of the year, but sadly it does not stay that great when we have the Butch scenes (even if also for Willis, it is a contender for career-best) and also the long sequence with Travolta and Thurman and also the final scene at the restaurant again with SLJ.Now I would like to speak about a few very specific scenes and moments and, in general, inclusions that stayed in my mind here. First of all, the restaurant with all these waiters in costume was amazing. I totally wanna go there. Did not even recognize Buscemi as Buddy Holly, even if I knew he worked with Q in Reservoir Dogs. Another great actor. Same for Harvey Keitel, even if he is not one of my favorites like Buscemi. Still Mr. Wolf is such an icon. When SLJ's character hears Marsellus is sending the Wolf, it is so hilarious. We know immediately that dude is a respectable fella who knows exactly what he is doing. I'd be happy to have Mr. Wolf bark orders at me and he also would have deserved his own film. I think he had a little cameo in another Tarantino work. This character has aged really well, just like the film as a whole. Then the food: The Kahuna Burger even makes me as a vegetarian immediately wanna take a bite. And that milkshake at the restaurant! Totally worth it. Kinda hilarious by today's standards how five bucks is a lot of money for a milkshake back then. But boy is it worth it. Even Vincent agrees. Speaking of Vincent, there is a lot I can say about him. Not just his funny posture at the Wallace residence that has been used for many memes, but also for example how keeping stuff secret when everybody goes their own way is something that occurs twice after somewhat memorable events during which characters are in life-threatening situations. You will know what I mean when you see the scenes. But an act of courage and integrity by one character (even if it is indirectly also about saving one's own life in both scenarios) saves the other person too.As for Tarantino: He once again also acts in here just like he did in some of his movies, also the much later one with Waltz, SLJ and Leo I mentioned earlier. There his inclusion is probably even more fun than here. But I still loved how he makes fun of himself directing in this one we got here during the water splashing scene near the end when he is basically directing Keitel in-character. Hilarious moment. Coincidence is also a big factor in this film we have here. What if... can be asked on so many occasions. What if the girl (the stunning Maria de Medeiros) had not forgotten the ring? Vega would not have been killed and actually this really put major emphasis on SLJ's character's decision. Had he not retired, could he have been there too, killed Butch and saved Vega? What if Vega had not left the gun in the room? What if Butch had never run into Marsellus when driving back to his girl. What if all these bullets had not missed the two during the apartment? What if Vega had not accidentally killed the boy in the car. No Tarantino and Keitel in this film then. And they would not have ended at the restaurant where in the end the circle really closes and even if I do prefer chronological films most of the time, there is no denying the lack of chronology here works very well. For example we see Vega knowing he is going to die later on. Charming moment also between Willis and Travolta when they meet for the first time.Okay, now one aspect and recurring joke I want to talk a bit about too.: Vincent Vega's toilet breaks. Every time he takes a bathroom break, catastrophe ensues outside really. Be it Mia ODing, the guys at the restaurant launching their robbery or Butch entering the apartment making toast for himself. Or indirectly also the guy at the apartment who storms outside. Okay this is not Vega taking a toilet break, but still the bathroom is really an aspect there too. This really shows you the bizarre humor Tarantino includes in his movies all the time. Kinda symbolic how toilets are significant here. And Vega apparently also does not have the best bladder or bowel movement with hof often he goes. He even asks for a toilet break at his dealer's apartment after they reached an agreement. Hilarious stuff. There are many other scenes about which you will laugh. Like for example when we see Marsellus with heavy injuries from the accident \"walk\" towards Butch in order to kill him and he walks like a zombie basically firing left and right. Or the toast moment I just mentioned giving us a parallel on what/who is finished that very moment. Or also the anecdote told by Walken's character about the gold watch. I mean it is meaningful, even historically meaningful in a sense, but at the same time it is also a reference on a guy hiding a watch for years in his butthole. It's kinda gross humor, but never childish fart humor or something like that. There is so much creativity and even intellect to it that it is a really great achievement and I am happy Tarantino received all this awards recognition for his work here. By the way, it is also a rare occurence that he is not the only one credited with the script.Finally, still one minor scene that stayed in the head for me, namely how they say when they enter the apartment (where a familiar face from NCIS is in btw.) they should have brought bigger guns because there are many thugs inside (also referenced later when there was one more than they expected, so Q even delivered in terms of mathematics) and with how Vega actually brought a big gun for one enemy (i.e. for a big gun) to Butch's apartment, but it wasn't enough, so taking care of your gun and situation is eventually more important than what kind of firearm(s) you bring. And the (non-chronological) ending scene is also memorable not just again for Jackson (even if I prefer him laying actual gun vengeance on people), but also because it is pretty much the only scene and sequence in which nobody is injured and people leave the restaurant all safe and sound, despite all the potential violence that could have happened in this scene, which also shows again that SLJ's character has sort of found his path to God. And there is no bloodshed. This would be all for my review then. I am a bit sad the film did not stay as strong as it started, but it is still a big fun ride and I recommend checking it out to everybody, even if it is not one of my favorites from Tarantino. SLJ's portrayal alone makes it worth watching I think and if you are one of the 3 or 4 on this planet who haven't seen it yet, then totally go for it or I will lay my vengeance upon you! Thumbs up.",

    "reviewTitle": "Pulp Fiction",
    "reviewBody": "Perhaps no other director places the entertainment value over essentially everything else than the quirky Quentin Tarantino. As long as people laugh, smile, and share in a cinematically glorious viewing experience of idiosyncratic dialogue, wacky story lines, who honestly can find it within themselves to give a hollerin' hoot about anything else? After his directorial debut of \"Reservoir Dogs\", Tarantino proved he possesses the talent to craft a screenplay and ultimately a film. Though a daring debut, \"Reservoir Dogs\" left out a majority of its action and subsequently more for the viewer to desire. With \"Pulp Fiction\", Tarantino delivers not only his best ever film, but a milestone in the delicate dexterity of original storytelling.In this film we see three interweaving stories involving hit men, a bank-robbing couple, a rogue boxer, and a near-fatal blind date. The two hit men, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, played by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta respectively, provide the two most outstanding performances. Samuel L. Jackson dominates the screen with his thunderous voice and unwavering demeanor in his portrayal of a \"cool- cat\" gangster. His partner in crime, John Travolta, also provides an intriguing and convincing performance that most assuredly rescued his career from the D-list depths of the \"Look Who's Talking\" series. Like \"Reservoir Dogs\", dialogue stands as the driving force behind the plot and characters of \"Pulp Fiction\". And not one line in the script lacks Tarantino's stamp of wit and cleverness. Characters speak fluently in wise-crack and tough guy throughout the plot, much like the cold-hearted noir heroes of the 40s such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe (both played by the late Humphrey Bogart). In one particular scene of retribution, the big man Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames, having endured the sexually unthinkable, promises to \"Go to work on the homes with a pair of pliers and a blow torch [] I'ma get medieval on you're a**.\" Goodness knows what \"medieval\" may imply, but safe to say the guy's got a bit of pain lying in his future.Bruce Willis, who plays the down and out boxer, fails to throw a fight and thus suffers the pursuit of Marsellus and his gangsters. Eventually Marsellus and Willis wind up in a truly bizarre scene of mouth gags and homosexual perversion. Somehow Willis manages to find a way to escape the dastardly situation and get Marsellus off his back all at once. Wacky and uncanny? Indeed, but like the rest of the film, Tarantino tells it with such fun and enthusiasm that one can feel the entertainment buzzing like a jet engine. Most of the dialogue stands in stark contrast to the majority of Hollywood writing which functions simply to further along the plot. Characters continually engage each other with conversations in which we might find ourselves conversing, making it all the more convincing. Tarantino's dialogue reveals character and dimension. It does not offer standard, thin lines that reveal only what the audience already knows. This works to provide the feeling that we eavesdrop on the characters as they chit chat about miscellaneous topics such as the nomenclature of hamburgers, the sexual implications of foot massages, piercings, etc. Though the dialogue may at first glance appear obscure and irrelevant, it obliquely implies events to come later in the unfolding of the plot. For instance, the talk of fast-food cheeseburgers does not stop in Vincent's car; rather we see the hamburgers return in the next scene as Jules and Vincent interrupt the uneasy Brett and gang as they dine on Big Kahuna burgers. We don't simply hear the dialogue, but we see a clever reprisal of the dialogue. It functions to the lay the comical and violence-tempering groundwork for future scenes. The unusual discussion between Jules and Vincent about what exactly a foot massage signifies between a man and a woman most notably lays the groundwork for the tension throughout the long sequence between Vincent and Mia Wallace, played by Uma Thurman. Before their blind date, we learn that Marsellus Wallace threw a man off a balcony for merely giving his wife a foot massage. So if Marsellus Wallace nearly kills a man for touching his wife's feet, imagine what he would do if someone happened to accidentally, oh I don't know, kill his wife. Thus the problem Vincent faces on his date-gone awry with Mia Wallace. Marsellus just might go \"medieval\" again. Vincent knows this but most importantly the audience knows this. Tarantino cleverly crafts his dialogue to heighten the tension and anxiety of the scene, keeping our attention like a light trap and a fly.By the end, which I shan't ruin for it serves better to hear and watch than read, the film comes back around in full circle, ending where it started. The events in \"Pulp Fiction\" arrive jumbled and for the most part out of order, which undoubtedly helped inspire the increased number of non-linear narratives that pervade throughout Hollywood today. The different plot lines of \"Pulp Fiction\" connect in some way, but each possesses a life of its own and can thrive individually. Because of this no better title could serve the film quite like \"Pulp Fiction\" does. The dictionary describes the phrase\"Pulp Fiction\" as \"fiction dealing with lurid or sensational subjects.\" Tarantino delivers sensation and he does so with smart dialogue, exuberant direction, and an array of actors that perform with just the right mixture of tough-guy wit and comedy.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is a lesson that even if people act on their best intentions, if they are surrounded by evil or around bad influences, there are so many events outside of their control that they are bound to be punished eventually. This is why Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to liberate himself from the \"evil life\" after experiencing his divine intervention. He wanted to be good and inspire benevolence in people rather than symbolizing the tyranny of evil men. In almost all the scenes of the movie we get reminded how destructive and grim situations can become if characters do not decide to live a life of virtue and responsibility. The verse recited by Jules progressively gains more power as we navigate the protagonist's desire for vengeance or restitution. It is the metaphor that if you initiate the process of changing your thoughts (biblical verse) maybe actions (forgiving pumpkin) might follow and also habits and life in general.As is customary in Tarantino's films, the majority of the characters have temerity, choleric temperament, unforgiving, and reckless decision making. Vincent (John Travolta) accidentally shoots his friend on the face while Jules drives the car. Mia (Uma Thurman) overdoses with cocaine and has to be revived by Vincent with an adrenaline shot to heart. Butch (Bruce Willis) decides to run over Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) on the street and ends up destroying his girlfriend's car. Marcellus and Butch fight on a weapon's store, and they get restrained, tied up, and sodomized by strangers. Tarantino was dead set on sending a message that if you are participating in illegal, immoral, or destructive behavior, you will get punished by destiny, fate, or god.The dialogue is some of the best I have seen in movies: Vincent's casual stories of Amsterdam, Jules and Vincent conversation on the comparison of feet massage and oral sex, the biblical verse Jules recites to his victims, pumpkin's description of how restaurants is the best place to rob. By these scenes the characters received personality, charisma, ideology, convictions. We get a glimpse into their life and aspirations; we understand their motivations. All of these instances give flavor and atmosphere to the movie that gives us a sense of novelty and originality.The astute part is that most of the characters seem reasonable and humane despite their murderous behavior. This adds more to the message of the movie that humanity can still be recovered after falling into the valley of darkness. The tension was not as good as some of his other movies, but the scenes compensate it with other cinematographic content. Jules scenes in the restaurant robbery and in the recovery of the briefcase were intense, smart, ruthless, charismatic, audacious, and original.",

The slicing of the time line is awkward at times, but it demands attention and makes a repeat viewing valuable, if not necessary. Nevertheless, in the end I ask myself: What I have learned? Where has this film taken me? It is like taking a wild roller coaster ride. It is worth riding again. But I cannot put it in the same category of great films that raise important issues or dramatize a moral dilemma. It does not have the philosophical dimension of great cinema like \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" \"The Seven Samurai,\" or \"Monsieur Verdoux.\" On the contrary, it's near glorification of gratuitous violence -- not matter how cinematic -- is ultimately offensive.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp fiction is certainly one of those films that will always be remembered for their emotional impact that they bring on while you watching them, Quentin Tarantino's master piece came to reveal and put on a high stage one of the world best film directors.What impressed me about Tarantino's gem was its plot, actually the plot provoked many critics, it intrigues everyone that watched the movie, but I would say the most important part in the plot was the characters as Samuel L.Jackson mentioned at the beginning of the film '' Come on, let's get in character'' all the characters involved in the movie were vivid and each one with his or her specific added values.The plot can be divided into three different stories, as long as the film is progressing they getting close to each other, as it is unveiled in the last coffee shop scene. Well it will take me more than that to describe the contribution of each character, but to sum it all up Characters were master key to put the film into a maverick joy.The music played an important role starting from the first scene with ''dick dale's pulp fiction Soundtrack'' illustrating a perfect start, and coming to one of the most entertaining scene when Vincent and Mia came on the stage to perform a dance that astonishingly matches with ''Chuck Burry's song- C'est la vie'', there are various of good music throughout the film.Pulp fiction was purely entertaining from the beginning to its last seconds, and it's a film that you have to watch multiple times, each time it will keep dazzling you. That's what an Entertaining movie should look like!! Highly recommended!!!",

    "reviewBody": "I can honestly say that this is my second favorite movie! My favorite is The Matrix. But let's get back to this. Yes, the movie is stylish and hilarious but it has a lot of meaning to it. Some say it's just one of those movies that are pointless and good. That's not true and ill tell you why: The reason they recite all those pop culture references within the movie just show that they constantly use these things to force meaning into their lives.You'll notice how Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) changes during the robbery scene at the ending of the movie. He said something about if this were a few hours ago I would have killed you already. Jules recited a Bible verse every time he killed someone to sound cool and meaningful. He was just trying to force some meaning into his life. When Vincent(John Travolta) and Jules were shot at, they didn't die. It was a miracle according to the movie, and only Jules would acknowledge that. Vincent just said \"whatever\". Then later on Vincent is killed by Butch(Bruce Willis) because he didn't quit working for Marcelles Wallace and he didn't change. Jules did change. That's why he got killed. That is just too thrilling to know.10/10",

Although there was violence, it was nothing I couldn't handle. I loved the comedic relief throughout the entirety of the film. After seeing this film, I now understand why it is so popular and why it is raved about so much. The plot was very interesting and kept me wanting more. I would definitely watch this film again, which in my opinion is what makes a movie so great- wanting to see it more than once. I'm glad this was an option for this weeks film because I don't think I would've just watched it on my own.",

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",

Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.

The rare male protagonist with conscience.Uma Thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug, lust and hunger to live free.Tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity, but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty.I have watched it and guarantee You waste of time",

    "reviewBody": "Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are two hit men on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stolen from their boss, Marsellus Wallace. They run into a few unexpected detours after they retrieve the case. Marsellus is out of town, and he's gotten Vincent to take his wife, Mia, out for a night on the town. Things go smoothly until one of them makes a huge error. Butch Coolidge is a boxer has been approached by Marsellus and been told to throw his latest fight. When Butch ends up killing the other boxer, he must escape Marsellus. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are two lovebirds who have decided to rob the restaurant they're currently eating at. But the restaurant doesn't turn out to be as easy as the other places they've robbed.......I can't say anything about this film that no one hasn't said before, but the film is phenomenal, its groundbreaking, and its one of the coolest films ever to be released in the nineties.But why is it? It's because its flawless, seamless, and no matter how many times you see the movie (and I guarantee, you will see it more than five times), it never gets boring, and there is always something new and unseen to catch your attention.Tarantino has crafted a timeless movie, and it will be remembered in years, and years, and years to come as one of cinemas greatest masterpieces, alongside Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and The Godfather.The cast are impeccable, and this film resurrected two flagging careers in Willis and Travolta, especially Travolta, whose every film for the next three years would be box office gold, and it's down to this.Plus don't forget, not many people had heard of Samuel L. Jackson before this, and after this, he's been in nearly every film ever made since, and you watch them, because you are waiting for that Jules Winfield magic.Every scene is wonderful, every set piece is perfect, and the script is sparkling, its pure gold.The weak link in the film? Tarantino's cameo, but hey, this is his invention, so I'll let him off.One of the last great films ever made.",

    "reviewBody": "\"Tarantino seems to be too concerned with other films. I mean, about appropriating other movies, like a blender. I think it's really funny at the time I'm seeing it, but then, I don't know, there's a void there. Some of the references are flat, just pop culture.\" - Harmony Korine \"It's like watching a schoolboy's fantasy of violence and sex, which normally Tarantino would be ******* alone to in his bedroom while his mother is making him baked beans downstairs. Only this time he's got Harvey Weinstein behind him and it's on a million screens.\" - Nick Broomfield \"Thirty years ago it would have been widely accepted that objective knowledge about society and history was an asset for a filmmaker. Today, such an attitude is considered a hindrance. This is a temporary state of affairs, but a costly and destructive one. Art, including bad art, has consequences.\" - David Walsh Quentin Tarantino directs \"Pulp Fiction\", a shamelessly lurid homage to early B-movies, printed pulp fiction (the dime-store tales of the 1940s-50s, and later pulp imitators - sometimes called \"new pulp\" - like Elmore Leonard and Charles Bukowski, whose own \"Pulp\" was released in 1994), Robert Aldrich (\"Kiss Me Deadly\"), \"Farewell My Lovely\", \"Pickup on South Street\" and Godard (\"Band of Outsiders\", \"Vivre sa Vie\", \"Alphaville\"). Nods to \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Truck Turner\" (the same comic monologues), \"Karate Kiba\" (Jackson's religious monologues repeated verbatim), \"On The Waterfront\", \"The Colour of Money\" (\"character\" vs \"having character\" conversation), \"The Parent Trap\" (Uma drawing an animated square on screen, also from \"The Three Little Bops\"), \"Repo Man\" (glowing briefcase; see also Aldrich), \"Charley Varrick\" (lifted lines, as well as the torture scene), \"Psycho\", \"Lili\" (everything about the Fabienne character), \"Easy Rider\", \"God of Gamblers\" (violence whenever Travolta goes to the bathroom), \"Three Days of the Condor\" (Vincent's death), \"Shoot the Piano Player\", \"Jules and Jim\", \"The Panic in Needle Park\" (the whole overdose fiasco), \"Policewoman\" (stylized credit sequence), and \"The Night Of The Hunter\" come next, all shoehorned before or after an extended sequence in a movie-themed restaurant in which all of Tarantino's references sit back, chill out and relax.The film is dense with allusions (Uma's two dances are taken directly from \"Band of Outsiders\" and \"Vivre sa Vie\", as is her haircut), cribbed shots and referenced dialogue, Tarantino packing the film to the brim with nods to esoteric art films, mainstream fare, trashy exploitation films and television programmes (\"Kung Fu\", \"Captain Kangaro\", \"Happy Days\", \"Cops\"). Characters likewise either work on TV shows (\"Force Five\"), knowingly repeat lines from movies (\"Zardoz\", \"Guns of Navarone\" etc) and documentaries (Scorsese's \"American Boy\" is the source of Lance's needle instructions) or are themselves named after songs (\"Flock of Seagulls\"), movies or movie characters (eg Tony \"Rocky Horror\" named after the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\", \"English Bob\" after a character in \"Unforgiven\" and Keitel's \"The Wolf\" based on a similar character in \"Victor the Cleaner\"). Posters of countless films are likewise littered throughout, as well as references to film directors (a \"Douglas Sirk steak\" - aka a steak with \"All That Heaven Allows\"). Some of the allusions are brief (boxer Bruce Willis' comes home after a fight and yells his girl's name like Stallone does in \"Rocky\"), whilst some are deliberately extended and toyed with.Some actors in the film even acknowledge their own roles in other films, Christopher Walken's character just coming back from \"Deer Hunter's\" Nam, Travolta's echoing his role in \"Saturday Night Fever\" and Ving Rhames' Marsellus Wallace delivering a monologue exactly like his character in \"Casualties of War\". Rhames' gimp suit encounter even echoes another gimp suit encounter in \"The People Under The Stairs\", also with Rhames. Cinematic pop cultural references even bleed into print references (Travolta reading \"Modesty Blaise\" etc), while the film's self-consciously fake process shots recall Dick Richards' noirs. Even the famous \"Quarter Pounder\" monologue is cribbed, and much of the character ramblings recall Jean Paul Belmondo in \"Breathless\".The film is structured as a series of short stories – all loosely connected and deliberately trashy – but within these stories are themselves characters who constantly take time out to tell equally digressive short stories. In this way the film is a tale about people telling tales, and so plays like a celebration of oration, of yapping, of a hundred and twenty years of seedy storytelling. Ironically, the film's best short story is that in which the characters decide to \"say nothing\". To shut up.Under postmodernism, art is inherently self absorbed, self-reflexive, de-structured, de-centred, fragmented, parasitic and churned out by artists whose media-saturated landscapes become \"all that there is to reality\". Such artists live in a kind of cocoon, seeking only to replicate past pleasures. This is a cinema of artifacts and furnishings. Of attitude, copied poses and interchangeable and indistinguishable references. Here, life is only an extension of media, everything is false and all that matters are gestures and role playing. And like other postmodern films, Tarantino's aesthetic is a seductive kind of hyper-stylisation, everything not only in quotes and supremely self conscious, but celebratory of self consciousness.\"Pulp Fiction\" is entertaining (and its narrative has a breezy, liberative quality), much better written than its imitators and one passage in particular, which plays with the classic cliché of \"the bodyguard and the bosses wife\", is graceful, low key and romantic. Much of the film is surprisingly inhumane, though, a kind of jokey 1970s exploitation movie in which people are either doped up, stabbed by needles, raping black men or coldly slaughtering teens while making grand speeches. Because the film exists in a certain moral vacuum (\"It's just a film\", \"It's supposed to be trash\", \"It's pulp ****ing fiction!\"), stuff like anal rape and murder are all played for snickers and kicks.8/10 - The \"Repo Man\" of the 90s?",

    "reviewTitle": "Comebacks, confirmations and class",
    "reviewBody": "OK the first thing one can say about this film is brilliant. 2nd thing is Tarantino is one of the great filmmakers. 3rd thing is Travolta is fantastic.Pulp Fiction is a film where he linked stories intensely intriguing and each one offers a different kind of entertainment. The syringe, the bible passage (Ezeikiel 25;17) and the Gimp. How does one single mind think of these ideas let alone link them in a screenplay and then transfer this onto film. Each shot is cleverly composed and the shots used appropriately. The only thing that annoyed me about Tarantinos effort was how he knew he was good but wasn't sure we knew. By that I mean the use of some techniques like the steady-cam shot at Jack Rabbit Slims, i felt it was unnecessary but i got over it.Travolta and Jackson give of so much charisma and energy its unbelievable. It's a shame Jackson never achieved this level of form again. But this performance shows what the two are capable of. Travolta acted so well he has become known as 'the Comeback Kid' (got that from Empire) and it's true that Pulp Fiction has reinvented what kind of actor he is. Thurman gives a decent effort and Bruce Willis performed better than expected, and Ving Rhames was so believable as Marcellus Wallace. Tim Roth gave a fantastic little performance, he's one of my favourite actors in all of Tarantinos works. So the cast was at its best.The soundtrack is phenomenal but what do you expect from a Tarantino film. Each song is chosen for a different purpose and interestingly during the more dramatic sequences he didn't use music like he did in the ear cutting scene during Reservoir Dogs. Which brings us to the script. Similar to Dogs but in its own way it is both better and equal. For instance before they are let into the apartment to pick up the case the conversation between Jules and Vincent is immensely funny.This is THE film of the 90s. Also catch Fight Club, Trainspotting and Lock, Sotck and Two Smoking Barrels for other classics.",

    "reviewTitle": "Pulp Fiction As The New Testament of Cinema.",
    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction As The New Testament of Cinema.Tarantino is always the body and the spirit of his movies, his movies don't exist apart from his personality and he is there (Mr.Brown, Jimmie, Chester Rush, Warren) personally to mark his territory. Tarantino is close 'cause we see him in his movies  Rodriguez don't pet us with cameos, while he is times more attractive than Cutie Anyways, when I first saw Pulp Fiction I was 13. Next day at school everybody was discussing that movie, our hips were saying \"Tarantino\" about a hundred times a minute. I was never hip, so when I asked which of them was Tarantino, they gave me a look that could kill. \"Tarantino is THE DIRECTOR, and by the way, he played there too.\" It was very funny  they considered knowing that so valuable, to me it was no more than just \"a\" movie then. \"Who did he play?\" I asked. When they told me I was shocked: \"What?! That pathetic imbecile in the robe was actually the director?!!!\" How could I know that that imbecile's IQ is 160 to my 118, but I didn't know it then and I didn't care.Funny, that exact dialogue that made me revere Tarantino years later, that dialogue is cut off the most of the copies of the movie, and the Cannes saw the cut version too. At least, the script is available for free and anyone can enjoy the full version, which contains even the unfilmed scenes.The main dialogue of the movie is cut. It is where Mia is giving Vince a third degree. It is here where Tarantino speaks himself and for himself (even though everyone in his movies is Tarantino, even bacteria in the actors' sweat speak Tarantino \"F\" English, still here it is his dream and his dream-girl), it's his fantasy, it's the questions he wanted to answer  he actually dreamed of getting beaten up by a girl, he loves Amazons, and his other works prove it (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol.1, Death Proof, etc.) Only strong men like to see strong women by their side.Tarantino and Roger Avary share the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but actually the full script was written by Cutie only, the stories were developed together. It was Roger Avary who developed the hideous rape scene, he said about that like all writers do  the characters did that on their own to the author's surprise, because he is a nice person, who would never invent something like that.Anyway, it's a movie that arouses a wide variety of interpretation, from seeing the deepest philosophical \"ditch\" in it to the calling it the lowest pop chuck, to me it is a classic Tarantino, and that says it all. He loved to see his beautiful child with the people, he would go to the cinema and watch it every time like the first time with them, noticing when they tensed and when they laughed, being tensed and laughing with them, being the happiest guy in the whole wide world then. I really think that he was the happiest guy then, you wouldn't find another like him.Well, there is one thing I hate when some very sophisticated and very spiritual specimen start to zoom around about some irony of the movie, the irony of Cutie, who is against violence on the screen, and in his movie he is saying: \"People, look at what you are doing, and stop!\", and they say it in such a pompous voice that it makes me almost physically sick. One of them happened to blabber in that way in my company. She had some good ideas too  she pointed out  it is not the bodies that shock, it is the attitude towards them that does. That is a nice phrase that sums up the reason why his movies seem to be and they are extra-violent. Okay, but then she goes again  people, look blah-blah-blah. I couldn't stand any longer: I told her about the first script, where Vince shot Marvin in the throat, and then with Tarantino little talk shot him in the head, Cuite changed that scene into one shot in the head  she was happy and said: \"Because it is softer!\", \"No, - I gloated, - HE actually said himself that he changed that because the straight shot in the head was FUNNIER\". She almost freaked out.Look, you may see anything you want in it, even Nostradamus prophecy, but keep in mind, that Tarantino is a brilliant guy who loves action, crime and kung-fu movies just for the fun of it, and we love him for that. You may see anything you want in Marcellus's case (from Marcellus's soul to Da Vinci manuscripts), but keep in mind that Tarantino and Avary concealed its contents only because their initial idea seemed too trivial to them  diamonds. They say: \"It depends on viewer's mind\", well, of course, it does, but I want to know what it is on your mind, that's why I watch your movie.So, one may see Da Vinci manuscripts, yet it may be plainly diamonds, but the movie is really epic. (I can't say that it's a must see, I don't like the word \"a must see\", like something forcing you into something) It is more than a fantastically good movie, it is the New Testament of cinema  new way of speaking in the movies, new way of storytelling, new way of being in the movies, new way of seeing the very movie-making idea.",

I just don't get it, and I'll never get it!To be honest, I feel like calling this film \"Stupid People Going Around Doing Stupid Things\" - I'm not joking! One thing after the other in this movie just CONFUSED me! The entire time I was like \"HUH!?\" Everything about the story lines, occurrences, the dialogue, and the pay off was just stupid! And the f-bomb is dropped in every other sentence, so much so, I felt like punching the screen in! It's said so much to the extent where it gets really annoying! I like Samuel L. Jackson, especially for his Stars Wars and MARVEL superhero work, but I don't care if he's mostly known for this! I hate him playing such over-the-top, nonsensical, controversial characters!And I hate films that just take advantage of even white-washing the names of Christians, and have the bad guy quote Bible verses. That's dangerous! It's brainwashing & manipulation! (Want my advice of a real Christian is?? Rachel Scott of Columbine who was killed for her faith, Dietrich Bonhoeffer who spoke out against Hitler and Nazi Germany, or even Dr. Kent Hovind who reveals a lot of amazing scientific evidence for the fact of special Creation and Biblical accuracy.) All much better and meaningful then this overrated pile of worthless celluloid NOTHING!Though to be fair, I think Quentin does have an decent taste in soundtrack variety. I admit, I've got those songs on my iPod as a result of watching this flick. And I do think the scene of Christopher Walken's \"Watch\" talk does for some reason relax me, simply because it's simply WALKEN - his delivery & his way of talking is somewhat kind of relaxing and amusing all at once. He's been interesting ever since I saw him in the comedy \"Mousehunt\". Though the scene STILL is stupid when the captain (or general, whatever) curses at a young boy about the \"A$$\" and how even a young boy would want such a filthy watch after being inside many men's anuses for a long time.I mean, Tarantino's just some director I don't like or care about - he claims he's against drugs and violence... THEN DON'T MAKE FILMS ABOUT THEM! You may be just condoning or giving ideas about drugs and violence! You're definitely part of the \"Hollyweird\" group aren't you??I'm all-round just THANK everything that is holy, sacred, and beneficial that I didn't see this film when I was younger! 1994 definitely was the big year for many good movies, but Pulp Fiction is certainly NOT one of them! It shouldn't have even been nominated for ANYTHING, not even Best Picture! IMO, \"The Lion King\" should've been nominated in it's place instead! A film that's all the more likable, fun, entertaining, relatable, family-friendly, and beautifully put together, it's ART! But guess not, since Hollyweird has got such a FETISH for pure violence, murder, sexual immorality, and biased anti-Christian propaganda.Pulp Fiction is just PAINFUL to sit through; Tarantino's a HACK! And I've never liked or will ever like any of his films!",

    "reviewTitle": "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",
    "reviewBody": "There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called \"style\". There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve.Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines).The strangest thing is, while the characters are \"in character\", as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There's really only a decent short film in all of this.The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing.Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there.While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler.As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated.",

    "reviewBody": "spoilers in this comment, probably.((( PULP FICTION is one of 1990ties movie highlights, and bringing the facts right to you; it's one of the cinema history's biggest highlights. Tarantino had already made RESERVOIR DOGS and achieved great reviews and were told that he would be the biggest director of this decade. Few years after that, he made PULP FICTION, a movie that settled with great cinematic power, how a good movie shall be. Tarantino got all these great actor/actresses into this very complicated and well made story and PULP FICTION was a defining movie. Vincent and Jules are hit men working for a negro crime boss named Marcellus Wallace. Marcellus is dealing with a boxer named Butch, Butch failed in Marcellus' mission to throw a fight after taking Marcellus' money and is planning to escape the city with his French maid, but simply can't leave a important object behind; his father's watch, that now off course belongs to him. In this time Marcellus' wife, Mia Wallace, is being taken care off by Vincent, who gets into problems when she sniffs his heavy drugs. And, in this there are a couple who's just started robbing a restaurant. AND - in Butch's escape he and Marcellus ends up kicking each other's butt in a local store, were it seems that the owner and some friends are crazy S&M rapists...and, there is a briefcase to be taken care off.The dialogs, music, acting and every freaking little thing works brutally well in this violent piece of movie making. Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames starring as the two men that's captured by these freaks down in a store-basement. Travolta and Jackson is simply amazing as the hit-man-couple who's both a pretty good friends but never really shares a joke. And all the small parts; Walken's small scene as Willis' father, Keitel as Mr. Wolf, Tarantino as pretty worried friend, Roth as the male robber and off course Uma Thurman's brilliant Mia Wallace. This movie is simply fantastic, genius AND pretty disturbingly well made! The best soundtrack of all time with Spansih guitars brutally going on as PULP FICTION appears on the screen as a big cahona on a plate. This is a movie not to be missed, although it may not be for the faint hearted, the movie delivers the goods so extremely well. It's brutality, use of fabulous words and genuine timing simply blown my mind pretty far away from any other movie. STARS: 5/5",

Jackson seeks redemption by handing over the loot to Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer during their bold restaurant robbery.It is also the story of a redeeming Bruce Willis who makes it out safely only to return to rescue leader Victor Rhames, who he had been shooting it out with when the two were captured by a white supremacy group ready to inflict severe pain on Rhames for being black.An interesting premise nicely done, but the film is overly violent and you really don't know in the end if all concerned have learned their lessons.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Worst Parts Of Life Made Fun",
    "reviewBody": "Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction takes all of the awful parts of our short lives, and embellishes them to seem outlandishly entertaining to watch. Murderous violence, drugs, sex, and every other disgusting thing that humans unfortunately feed off of, are utilized to craft an ironically enjoyable story that beautifully communicates this irony through its intense style. However, there are a few issues within the film that are frequently showcased throughout the early career of Tarantino. The editing, although flawlessly connecting a multitude of stories together, withholds a few distracting particulars. Right at the end of the film's first scene, there's a distracting transition that cuts off Yolanda's line after the frame becomes still. Furthermore, this same line is later altered during that couple's stand-off scene against Jules & Vincent. This ending scene to the film is also burdened by the same factor that Mr. Pink's escape sequence in Reservoir Dogs conjured, that of a lack of suspense. Earlier in the film, the audience was shown that Jules & Vincent make it out of the diner scene safe and sound. Therefore, the only suspense we're given within the movie's last sequence is that of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny's possible deaths. Also, why does Vincent never hear ANYTHING when he goes to the restroom? Yes, the repetition of this factor throughout the film is hilarious. However, it makes no sense, especially when there are two people just outside literally screaming that they're going to shoot up the diner. Anyways, back to editing, Mia Wallace drew a rectangle instead of a square. What else can I say? It annoyed me that they purposefully edited in an incorrect addition to an actually funny line when they could have left out the actual \"square\" in the first place. Finally, there was an absolute perfect opportunity for a callback during the first Butch and Fabian scene when he \"sticks his tongue in the holiest of holies.\" He should have given her a foot massage at the beginning of the scene! That would have been an incredible nod to the film's second conversation. Anyways, nothing actually awful hindered its incredible commentary, enjoyable performances, and stellar writing that connected dozens of characters together. This is a great film!94% or 9.4/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Shot of adrenaline that lit up the film world of the 90s.",
    "reviewBody": "Read this loud and clear: Pulp Fiction will never ever happen again. The impact, the delivery, the timing, and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated. See, there are bad movies, good movies, great movies, and trailblazers. The trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement, revolutionize the industry, change the landscape of motion pictures, and delivers an impact whether immediate (Star Wars) or down the road (Fight Club) that never exits the general consensus.Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Psycho, Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Graduate, and Goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers. None of these films have any contemporaries, they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them. Pulp Fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring, unexpected, stylish, and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed.Pulp Fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didn't know how to handle it. The soundtrack (among the best in film history), the unexpected blend of violence, drugs, and realistic dialogue, the surprises, the utter lack of chronological order, the style, the tone, and the overall look of Pulp Fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s, but everything preceding it. It talks like a Scorsese movie, moves like a 1950s Italian neorealism flick, paces like a spaghetti western, and breathes like an underground comic book come to life. Pulp Fiction is tasty cinematic soup.Pulp Fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did. Pulp Fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong, the story lines were unique, and there were so many details (explained and unexplained) that it required multiple viewings to catch it all, and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day. It was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman Quinten Tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the \"bad\" (Death Proof) and the good (Django Unchained).Everything in this movie works. The cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, AND Christopher Walken in one movie??!!). The dialogue was sharp, witty, brutal, and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga. The directing by Tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups, long shots, and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going.This movie literally has it all: sex, violence, drugs, rock n' roll, dancing, singing, crime, morality issues, romance, revenge, monologues, potential miracles, shootouts, dark humor, dozens of film references, and even a couple glimpses of the California underworld that most people would rather not know about. And all this was accomplished without a Hollywood budget. There was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge, like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry. This would inspire an entire wave of budding, ambitious, and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didn't want to cater to the typical Hollywood output or abide by its rules. Pulp Fiction is a B-Movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish.You can't duplicate this. I couldn't duplicate this. Tarantino could never duplicate this. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made, and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today. Pulp Fiction is as absolutely cool as its gets.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie first starts by boldly introducing two characters, in the 1950s a Jules (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) by jumping into their daily life. Starting off with no context towards their background, this film dumps you into a life of crime, murder, and drugs. As the plot progresses the film tells its story from the perspective of three different characters and completely engrosses you in its world. The intense need for violence in this movie is what drives us to the edge of our seats and keeps us there for the full length of the film.Quentin Tarantino used the aspect of different perspective to thoroughly encapsulate viewers and leave many in awe as they watch this film masterpiece.

However, recently after this I watched Saturday night fever and instantly became a huge John travolta fan, so I felt I should give pulp fiction another try and I'm so glad I did. I love the acting by Travolta and Bruce Willis especially, and the quotes by Samuel l Jackson are classic and Hilarious. I could tell the film had me hooked as I was shaking when Vincent gave Mia the adrenaline shot, because even though it's my second time watching, the acting's so good you feel that she might actually be dead. Though the order of the scenes can be confusing, it all makes sense when you watch the whole film as it all links together and keeps you interested as you don't know when the actual end is.

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece! No it isn't. It's over-rated. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's not as good as it's painted. And Tarantino's faults - which become more apparent with every (pretentiously) numbered subsequent movie - are all here on show.His dialogue is good - it's his main strength, and is correctly recognised as such. But a) it is over-reliant on the F-word (his CSI episodes and Inglourious Basterds show that he can write excellent dialogue without it), and b) it would greatly benefit from external editing: Tarantino badly needs a McCartney to sweeten his Lennon, a Lennon to apply an edge to his McCartney.His direction is good - he extracts brilliant performances from his ensemble, and his ability to present a truly eye-catching image on screen is beyond doubt. Action is good, effects are good, set design is good etc.But he comes in for undue praise for other things. Self-indulgence is one - again, he desperately needs someone to take him in hand and moderate some of what he does for the benefit of the film.Case in point - Pulp Fiction's non-linear storytelling. The zip-rewind halfway through is not some sudden work of genius. It may very well be experimental but, if so, it does not work as well as linear storytelling would have done (which, I suspect, would have involved more work in breaking the story threads into coherent sections which still worked together when interleaved, or else inserting flashbacks). Tarantino has taken an unconventional, but easy, road and, in so doing, has got away with it because of the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" factor. However, it doesn't make Pulp Fiction a work of genius, it actually makes it a worse film.Tarantino's lack of self-discipline means that, despite his abundance of talent, his output continues to be over-rated.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Nineties, one Masterpiece and a Mysterious Black Briefcase ...",
    "reviewBody": "Writing is an instinct Quentin certainly possesses, and with \"Pulp Fiction\", his second film, he made a sensational break-through entrance in the great directors' joint. His influence on movies in the late 90's and early 00's is indisputable and even after 16 years, the freshness and originality of \"Pulp Fiction\" never ceases to strike. The film is thrilling, entertaining and darkly amusing from the beginning to the ending. Indeed, \"Pulp Fiction\" is just one of these films where things reach such a level of whatever makes movies worth being admired; on the top of that : writing. This is what makes \"Pulp Fiction\" rhymes with perfection and what most defines the Tarantinesque style.Chapter 1. The Cannolis of the Nineties.Writing is the special ingredient. When characters talk in a Tarantino film, the subtlety is that it makes you think it has nothing to do with the plot, that it's totally irrelevant, when in fact it is totally irrelevant and random yet it serves the plot. One golden rule in screen writing is that what you put must be related to the story : Tarantino throws away this rule and still respects it. The discussion about the little differences and how they call hamburgers is mentioned again when Jules asks Brett about it and till now, Vega's \"Royale with Cheese\" still resonates as the Canolli's quote of the 90's. The foot massage discussion finds another relevancy as it helps to characterize Marcellus's sensitivity and electrify the whole interaction between Jules and Mia. The Gold watch story, makes Butch' burst of anger totally understandable when Fabienne admits she forgot it. There were 1000 ways to make us learn about the Gold watch story, Tarantino takes a legendary actor telling us with such conviction we don't know if we're supposed to laugh or take it seriously. Deeper than that, notice how the Divine Intervention that saves Jules and Vincent's asses, inspired different reactions and the one who decides not to retire will ultimately be killed. God seems to play with fate like Tarantino with plot devices. Notice how Jules' decision will save Ringo and Pumpkin and lead to an Ezekiel's bloodless recitation. And of course, the reappearance of the two robbers at the end of the film is another tribute to Quentin's creative trademark: non-linear narrative structure. Sure Quentin didn't invent that, but he transcended it, making it an element of entertainment and total unpredictability. We'll go back to unpredictability later.Chapter 2. From \"Misirlou\" to \"Surf Rider\" Music is one of the key qualities of Quentin Tarantino films. It's like a second casting, Quentin casts his music like he does for his female characters. What would have been this film without the dazzling \"Misirlou\" start, without \"Girl, You'll be a Woman\", and the iconic \"You Never Can Tell\" featuring one of the weirdest but most memorable and reenacted cinematic dance sequences. Quentin doesn't embarrass himself by choosing a composer or a grandiloquent score, no, he drains his inspiration from Pop Culture, from existing songs that would have probably sunk into oblivion if there weren't touched by Tarantino's selective instinct. The music is like a second language in his film, and it sure mixes perfectly well, with the dialogs. Whenever I hear the shrill voice of Honey Bunny shouting \" last one of ya\" I immediately imagine \"Misirlou\" starting, like the emblematic hymn of the 90's. But music ain't the only one element ejecting the movie from the land of normality  Chapter 3. Perfection : from Head to Foot.Tarantino is the goddamn casting fairy of them actors  no seriously, he has like a magic power, who else could have made Travolta resuscitating after his \"Look Who's Talking\" career? Who else could have made Samuel L. Jackson look so bad-ass with this ridiculous wig? Who else could have convinced Ving Rhames to re-enacts Ned Beatty's deliverance? Oh, I should get to the point, who else can make so close to perfection female castings, covering all tastes of women we can imagine : from the hypnotic Uma Thurman, to the hysterical Yolanda, to the punky pierced Jody, from the sweet and tender Fabienne to the sensuous lips of Esmarelda Villalobos, they're all defining a specific feminine charm. And thanks, Mr. Tarantino to make us finally assume out little fetishism  Chapter 4. Black Humor and White TowelsUnpredictability relies on what I would call the little differences that makes \"Pulp Fiction\" a classic film. It has this thing in common with other masterpieces like \"The Godfather\" or \"Citizen Kane\", where every single scene is a classic, from A to Zed. The meaning of the title, the robbery preceding the opening credits, the mysterious glowing stuff inside the briefcase, the foot massage discussion, the square visual effect, the dance contest, Mia's feet walking on the floor, the adrenaline shot, the Coolidge vs. Hoover fight, Esmarelda's feet stepping on the accelerator, Fabienne's oral wish, Fabienne's f sweet accent, Vincent's death, Marcellus crossing the road with his box of donuts, Zed and Maynard, the Gimp, Marcellus's medieval speech, Zed's demise, Marvin  now that was unpredictable, who could see that coming? Should we laugh? Yes, 'cause it's funny as hell. It was an accident, as if it was supposed to be an excuse. The whole movie and what follows is the ultimate proof that this film is a masterpiece of comedy; the whole \"Bonnie\" situation creates so many gags, including the memorable appearance of Winston Wolf. This part sacred \"Pulp Fiction\" as a great film; and the last minutes made it a classic.End of story. When Jules and Vincent leave the restaurant, with the \"Surf Rider\" song starting, you know your eyes have been watching something new and fresh, something that will change the face of movies for a bunch of years to come. Just for \"Pulp Fiction\", Quentin Tarantino deserves to be admitted in the directors writers' hall of fame.",

    "reviewTitle": "Flawless, Absolutely Flawless",
    "reviewBody": "A hilarious, thrilling rollercoaster captured in essence by the incredible Quentin Tarantino; 'Pulp Fiction' sees an impressive cast bonding to create the perfect mural of all things entertaining. The comedy mingles with the seriousness of the film, reinforcing Tarantino's intention to make the film a comedy. Its structure and overall direction is exquisite, contrasting two different livelihoods and gradually advancing to their relevance. Hitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the Bible before he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus, but have to wait while he bribes champion boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. The next day, Vincent purchases heroine from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up, then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom he had agreed to escort while Marsellus was out of town. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenalin shot to her heart. Butch betrays Marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. At the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. Returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a MAC-10 on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom, and Butch shoots him dead, leaving the gun inside. As Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus spots him by chance crossing the road. Butch crashes his car into Marsellus, leaving both of the men injured and dazed from the accident. After coming to, Marcellus takes a gun out and shoots at Butch, and then chases him into a pawnshop. The owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in the basement. Zed, a security guard, joins Maynard. Together, they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving \"the gimp\", a silent figure in a bondage suit, to watch Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp with a punch. He is about to flee but decides to save Marsellus, returning with a katana from the pawnshop and kills Maynard. Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun and shoots Zed. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, as long as he tells no one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's motorbike, and they drive away. Earlier, after Vincent and Jules have killed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, but misses with every bullet. Afterwards, Jules and Vincent kill him. Jules professes their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. As Jules drives, Vincent accidentally shoots Brett's associate Marvin in the head, covering themselves and the car in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Jules' friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. Marsellus sends his cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard. At a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple dubbed \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\" hold up the restaurant. Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her. Jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase. Providing the unique cyclical structure of ending where we started, 'Pulp Fiction' is a hilarious creative spectacle. Its production and direction is impressive and credit to Tarantino for revitalising Travolta and Willis' acting career's - the director's cameo isn't too bad either. Possessing a fast-paced hurry, the film ensures its crime and action is accommodated at all times with jokes and humour, to take away the sense of seriousness. As viewers we are often greeted with a 'happy ending' but the diner scene is more meaningful, Samuel L. Jackson's character seemingly resents his life of brutality and violence, and is focused on reciting a biblical message. He allows the two lovers to leave free of charge or punishment, in fact paying them for their services, the unusual act sees Jules be the 'bigger person', the perfect ending to a film fuelled with extroverts.",

The dance scene was kinda funny, it was good to see Travolta dancin again, though not from the way he used to, and I liked also the scene where they try to inject Uma's character, and when she got up, that was amazing. I liked also the segment of the watch, the one with Bruce Willis. When he bumped into Ving Rhames' character, that was cool, and I also liked how they got back at the cop and store owner, and I must say Sam Jackson's character was very strange, but still, he was great and convincing in his character. Definitely a must see for those who love fast paced movies, and those who love Quentin Tarantino's work.",

    "reviewBody": "One of the first movie trailers I ever remember really liking.  Thanks to that trailer and the pulse-pounding guitar riffs of the chosen song, I was immediately taken in.  I first saw this film four years after it's initial release and it still stays with me every time.  This movie isn't \"Resevoir Dogs\" but it's a classic nonetheless.\"Pulp Fiction\" easily has ten things going for it (spoilers contained herein): (1) The dialogue is quotable and I still hear quotes from it. (2) The scene with the adrenaline shot is one that should never be duplicated. (3) Samuel L. Jackson rocked this movie.  This was the best performance of his career. (4) Harvey Keitel was best supporting performer.  He was the comic relief and he did very well at it. (5) Quentin Tarantino is a master writer and master director. (6) The interweaving and rather disturbing tales are told surprisingly well. (7) The film editing was unreal.  I think Memento took some ideas from this movie. (8) The imagery dealing with God and spirituality made me wonder for a good long time. (9) Several rather unknown people show up and make for some memorable performances (Burr Steers and Phil LaMarr were in the first third). (10) The movie had a certain cheese factor that made it all the better.  Ten reasons give a score of 10.Cheesy and well-written are clearly two contradictory elements and that is especially true in the medium of film.  Quentin Tarantino proved the world wrong with the release of this movie.  It really rules!  Here ends my rant!",

    "reviewTitle": "Remarkable second feature from Quentin Tarantino - a masterpiece of dialogue, style and sheer story-telling chutzpah.",
    "reviewBody": "For better or for worse, Pulp Fiction changed forever the cinematic landscape of its time, not to mention times thereafter. It was followed by a deluge of copycats and wannabes, none of which quite matched the staggering bravura of this film – we really are talking here about a movie which epitomises that old dictum \"the original and still the best\". In this nonlinear trilogy of gangland stories – stuffed to the brim with crackling dialogue, pop culture references, stylised gunplay and jet black humour – Quentin Tarantino delivers an audacious and endlessly watchable movie, at once rewriting and redefining the whole style of the crime genre.The first story deals with hit men Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) as they track down a briefcase full of 'something valuable', stolen from their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) by a group of young opportunists. Later that evening, against the advice of Jules, Vincent escorts Marcellus's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), on a dinner date which spirals out of control with almost tragic consequences. The second story follows down-at-heel boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) who has been bribed by Marcellus to throw a fight. Butch doesn't keep his end of the bargain, pummelling his opponent to death in the ring before making a hasty getaway. Later, Butch attempts to flee from the city but first needs to retrieve a family heirloom – a precious watch – from his apartment. His attempts to recover the watch set into motion a crazy chain of events involving rednecks, gimp masks and a samurai sword! The third and final thread jumps back in time and follows Jules and Vincent once more, this time showing how they make a thorough hash of bringing in one of the young dudes who attempted to steal Marcellus Wallace's fortune. With an unexpected corpse on their hands, they need help from 'cleaner' The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) to mop up their little problem. And even then, their eventful day is far from over as, next, they inadvertently get caught up in an impromptu coffee shop heist masterminded by Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer).While the narrative structure of Pulp Fiction is devilishly clever, the plot itself doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. The plot merely provides a backdrop against which the characters can interact – the film generates infinite fascination in its rich yet random conversations, where the characters chat casually about things like foot massages, European fast food joints, classic TV shows, piercings and why pigs are filthy animals, plus much, much more. Whatever else you say about Tarantino, he's the best there is when it comes to writing terrific passages of dialogue – there's nothing in cinema quite like a Tarantino conversation. Choosing a favourite performance from the remarkable ensemble work is almost impossible; everyone is in dynamic form, though it is perhaps Jackson, as the bible-bashing, smart-mouthed hit-man Jules, who leaves the most lasting impression. His career post- Pulp Fiction has been, quite simply, a twenty year success story. There's an abundance of terrific individual scenes too – the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which Vincent saves Mia from a drug overdose; the clean-up of Marvin's corpse after being accidentally shot by Vincent; Christopher Walken's unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of Butch's gold watch It would take too long to list all of the film's many wonderful vignettes; let's just say it overflows with great moments. Different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. If Reservoir Dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in Tarantino, Pulp Fiction marks a quantum leap in style, control and story-telling bravado. It remains a brilliant film, only Tarantino's second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best.",

    "reviewTitle": "Wildly Original, Creative, And Entertaining.",
    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is a very entertaining viewing experience. I've never seen a film as original as Pulp Fiction. The structure of the movie is so creative, that it's hard to stop watching once you've started. This film is one that is very well liked among people everywhere, but some people don't understand it. The film does happen out of chronological order, as you may already know. Being out of chronological order makes it a little bit hard to follow, but having certain things happen at the beginning makes the film more involving the whole way through. (this part contains spoilers) Pulp Fiction is set up in three stories. Stories 1 and 2 do happen in chronological order, but the opening scenes are actually a few clips of the third story, which chronologically happens before the first 2 stories. If that was too confusing, this part might analyze the movie a little bit better for you. In the opening scene we see a man and a woman in a diner talking, and then they start a hold up. Then it cuts away to the opening credits. After that we see 2 mafia hit-men, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield(Samuel L Jackson) going to an apartment where they are supposed to take care of a few guys who stole a brief case from the mob boss, Marsellus Wallace. After that scene is when the stories take place. The first story is about how Vincent is asked to look after Marsellus's wife. The second story is about how a boxer(Bruce Willis) cut a deal with Marsellus and is being pursued by Marsellus's hit men. The third story, which is briefly shown at the beginning, picks up after Vincent and Jules killed most of the men in the apartment, and they accidentally shot one guy in their car, so they try to cover it up before one of their associate's wives finds out about it. Basically, from what I got out of this movie, this is an anti crime type of story. Throughout the story, certain members of the mob experienced things that would never have happened if they weren't involved with crime. Pulp Fiction is a movie that everyone experiences differently. If you experienced it the way I did, it will be a film you'll never forget. Definitely worth viewing, a very unique type of viewing experience.",

    "reviewTitle": "Overrated",
    "reviewBody": "Overrated is an understatement. This movie is start to finish garbage. I though Reservoir Dogs was an OK movie, and I liked Inglourious Basterds a lot. I don't have a problem with violent or perverse content in movies (My all-time favorite is David Fincher's Fight Club), but this movie is just crap. I understand the nostalgic aura about how this movie \"revolutionized\" what was acceptable to do in movies, but that doesn't make it a good movie by any means.The acting as a whole was entirely sub-par. As usual, Samuel L. Jackson's acting is consistent with the career he has built on shouting (a la \"Snakes on a Plane\") and contributed nothing positive to the movie. Same goes for John Travolta, whose acting was arguably worse than Jackson's. There's a significant unconvincing \"memorization\" tone to his lines. The only reason this is considered to have resurrected his career is because he was in the movie at all; once the movie became a cult classic, he became the marketable actor he once was.I already said I don't have a problem with movies that contain explicit language, but in Pulp Fiction, there are certain instances where too many expletives are inserted, and I'm not sure for what effect. If you listen to Tarentino's lines (as Jimmy) and Jackson's lines (when they're cleaning out the car), I think these lines best exemplify the overkill I'm talking about.Another thing about the movie is it is generally not relatable. I realize this seems like not a legitimate complaint- after all, how marketable would a movie really be if it was wholly relatable? However, I just felt like the over-glorification heroin use, among other aspects really turned me off. Also, usually movies that glorify or portray behavior/lifestyles similar to those depicted in Pulp Fiction have characters that are normal human beings. In this movie, every character is either a murderer, a gangster, a drug dealer, someone with a drug problem, an accomplice to a crime, or a rapist. I just don't see the redeeming social value here.If you like movies with quality acting, character development, any sort of plot, or a message that doesn't bash the Bible; chances are Pulp Fiction is not for you. The one thing that Tarentino got right was the title: Pulp Fiction; this movie is both \"cheaply produced art\" and \"fake.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "My guilty pleasure",
    "reviewBody": "I prefer Pulp Fiction to Reservoir Dogs. I find it to be the funniest out of the two. There are so many funny situations that has me in stitches and it mainly involves Vincent and Jules. The scenes I laugh the most at is when Vincent shoots Marvin accidentally in the head, Jules and Vincent cleaning the car after and when Vincent brings an o-ding Mia to Lance's house, that just has me in stitches every time.I loved the interaction between Jules and Vincent. I couldn't wait for the film to switch back to them because they had really good chemistry, they were so hilarious together and I just enjoyed their reactions to the situations they found themselves in throughout the movie. I like that again Quentin Tarantino shoots the film out of sequence because it means that John Travolta who is shot in the middle of the movie, is alive at the end.There are other story lines entined in the film- Ringo and Yolanda robbing the coffee shop, Mia and Vincent's date, Butch (a boxer) who is paid to take a dive but ends up killing his opponent and trying to keep one step ahead of Vincent and Jule's boss Marsellus Wallace but as I have said I am more interested in the scenes that feature Vincent and Jules.I can see why this film was the comeback vehicle for John Travolta as he is just brilliant in it and it never seems like he doesn't belong in the role, what I also like about his role is he is not afraid to send himself up which we see especially in the dance scene with Uma Thurman. I can't imagine anyone else in Samuel L. Jackson's part, he just makes it his own. The other actors who I feel make the film entertaining is Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz.Yes, it has violence, some people class it as racist, I really don't know, maybe I'm wrong but I get the impression he is not doing it to be racist but is showing a world that not anyone sees or thinks still exists. It might be ugly but at least it is honest in saying our world is not as perfect as we think and the subjects covered in the film are happening somewhere. I have respect for Quentin Tarantino for not copping out and not trying to soften the hard core subjects the film features such as drug use and murder. A very good job, Quentin.",

    "reviewTitle": "A slice of LA gangster life",
    "reviewBody": "This film from Quentin Tarantino tells the intertwining stories of a couple of gangsters, their boss's wife, Mia, and a boxer who is meant to throw a fight. There is little in the way of plot; we just observe their lives for a few days. The two gangsters are Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield and they work for Marsellus Wallace; early on Vincent and Jules discuss an incident where Marsellus threw another man out of a fourth floor window for allegedly giving his wife a foot massage something that makes Vincent nervous as Marsellus has asked him to take Mia out for the night while he is out of town. The evening goes well until they get back to Mia's house and she overdoses on Vincent's heroin while he is in the bathroom. The second story follows Butch the boxer who rather than throwing a fight for Marsellus beats his opponent to death. He knows he has to get out of town but first he must return home to retrieve his watch that has been in the family for generation. This puts him in a dangerous place when he bumps into Marsellus. Finally we see events that took place earlier after Vincent accidentally shoots somebody in a car and he and Jules have to get some help from 'The Wolf'.As I said earlier this isn't about plot; that isn't to say nothing happens though quite the opposite. There is a decent amount of action; some of it sudden and shocking as well as great characters. It is these characters that the film is really about. The cast does a fine job; most notably John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson who are on top form as Vincent and Jules; Uma Thurman is also impressive as Mia Wallace as is Ving Rhames as her husband. Bruce Willis does a fine job as Butch and Harvey Keitel puts in a memorable performance as 'The Wolf'. The non-linear way the story is told isn't confusing; I rather liked how the opening and ending scenes were concerned with the same event and chronologically took place in the middle of the story. Quentin Tarantino's dialogue is realistic but cool; I liked how the characters talked about mundane things; it made them feel far more real than if they had only talked about things relevant to the plot as characters in most films do. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; it is gripping, full of great characters and dialogue and contains many unforgettable scenes it does however contain material that will offend many people; most notably a lot of swearing and liberal use of 'The N-Word' as well as some shocking moments.",

    "reviewTitle": "Words Simply Cannot Do Justice To This Film",
    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is one of those films where I simply cannot put into words how great it is. The script is brilliant, the film is great despite being near 150 minutes and EVERY actor/actress plays a great part.I did find the film confusing the first time I saw it but after I had watched it everything made sense.Every character in the film has depth. Take John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They're not just playing a pair of emotionless hitmen like most films portray. They're real people with real feelings and real emotions. The same goes for Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace and Harvey Keitel as The Wolf. They are without a doubt the best characters ever in a film and I cannot praise them-and Quentin Tarantino-enough. As for Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, well I think this is the best ever role for the underrated Bruce Willis who is such an interesting character.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The scenes are great throughout. One scene I enjoyed was where Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace are at the mercy of a homosexual pawn shop owner and his twisted friend Zed (and some freak called the Gimp). It was a bit of an uneasy scene to watch but the reason I enjoyed it was because Butch Coolidge came back to save Marsellus Wallace who was at the mercy of homosexual rapist Zed. Moments earlier Butch and Marsellus had been enemies but Butch rushed back and probably saved Marsellus's life. I found that quite interesting. In my opinion it showed us that there may be honour even among thieves.Of course, there are many other great scenes too numerous to mention. Pulp Fiction opens with a bang and finishes with a bang. Anybody who hasn't seen the film is strongly advised by me to get the video or DVD as soon as possible.Brilliant masterpiece! Well done to all those involved in it!",

    "reviewTitle": "I consider myself to be a big fan of Marvel and definitely of Spider-Man, but something wasn't right about this film",
    "reviewBody": "Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that \"my back\" joke and Norman Osborn repeating \"I'm something of a scientist myself\". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be \"cured\"(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like \"yeah this guy sucks\" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.",

    "reviewTitle": "Somehow better than Endgame",
    "reviewBody": "It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nonsense And Nostalgia",
    "reviewBody": "Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the \"jokes\", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.",

    "reviewTitle": "Definitely one for the fans...",
    "reviewBody": "Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of \"Spider-Man\" in general.My rating of \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",

    "reviewBody": "Peter is back! Everyone knows who he is and that's the problem! This is a fantastic spiderman movie, no.. this is the ultimate Spiderman movie. This was such an experience i honestly felt like a kid again. I can't believe they returned! I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend! A Must See!!! 11/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Homeless and restless",
    "reviewBody": "There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...",

    "reviewTitle": "A good, not great movie.",
    "reviewBody": "This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.",

    "reviewBody": "It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary.",

    "reviewBody": "Such a a cool concept and bringing back the other 2 Spider-Man is all we fans wanted / but the story, plot, character motivations and script was not up to the challenge.Biggest flaw is that Spider-Man chose to 'save' these villains (putting everyone's lives at risk) for what reason? Because he's so good inside? There are infinite villains and Spider-Man so this motivation is weak and frustratingly illogical.Plus they stuff up a magic spell and no one thinks to go find Wanda? Theyve clearly outlined she's more powerful than the sorceress supreme. No? No one?Not go to Wakanda? Nothing?Killing May is just the same 'fridging that all the lame old superhero movies use to isolate the hero. It's dull as dishwater and now they've wiped away all the coolness of this interaction for out of date adages.And the moping... Jesus Christ that's dull. All the navel gazing 'what's it all about', 'who am I'. Massive yawn. This movie was at least 20 mins too long.The big reveal of Toby and Andrew? What a letdown. Wouid have been better in an action scene where Spider-Man is about to smashed and a web comes out of nowhere... much cooler.And lastly the memory wipe. So no one remembers him? What about school records? How does Happy know he knows May 'through Spider-Man'? Who does he think that is then?This movie is a 7 and anyone giving it any more is just excited because of the fan theory hype and not.",

    "reviewTitle": "Sincerely Disappointing and Objectively Pointless",
    "reviewBody": "When Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire enter the movie, the cinema rightfully erupts into a hail of cheers and applause. The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.",

    "reviewBody": "Went to see this opening day to avoid spoilers and boy was i pleased i did. Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.",

    "reviewBody": "I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter's ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn't know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy's apartment? We never know quite how he builds these \"cures\", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it's \"science\". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using \"math\". It's like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don't know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I'm a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren't funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn't feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn't funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn't want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you're going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all \"fixed\"...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole \"forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is\" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn't learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May's grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn't like MJ said. I actually expected not to be disappointed, which made it worse.",

    "reviewTitle": "Super holiday entertainment loaded with visual and spiritual meaning.",
    "reviewBody": "Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): \"The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!\"Notwithstanding the \"home\" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.",

When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until now the visual, edit, it so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause they visual look great like a game. I still can't believe it's look like what fans theory said and fan made I can't.I really enjoyed the movie the credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked, shacking, that's was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me to HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I was really wanna cry cause it was so good. I can't stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I really wanna watch it again. And venom part I thought he was going to help or fight the spiderman, but he was give a venom to MCU. This movie was one of the saddest MCU movies ever I'm so sad when aunt may died, and everyone forget about Peter Parker. At the end Peter Parker was make a new suit and the suit it's really looked like the other spiderman movie. This was so on fire!!!!!.I've watch this 3 times and there's some scene not make sense but this movie still so so so good... like when The girl From MIT open her seatbelt and then when Car want to fall she was use the seatbelt. And Spiderman costum when Dr otto Break his costume The Middle of The costume was break, and when green goblin come The suit was not full, idk why but maybe cause when he fully his costum to save him From Dr otto maybe cause he didn't use The Mask so The custom was full in his body and when he use The Mask his Middle custome was break.Edit : I've been thinking about this like a month I think no way home VFX it's not that good I mean it was really look like a fan made edits.",

What we got was a shaky plot with Ned whipping out doctor strange moves after 0 training and peter risking the universe collapsing for the lives of a few random villains. Lazy lazy writingAnd the end fight we had maybe 10 seconds of our 3 Spider-Men fighting together. The rest was choppy scenes of each character fighting their respective villians. Where was the unity? Thats what we wanted, some combo moves between the 3 at least :(There were obviously some great moments dont get me wrong but i feel people aren't really taking the movie for what it is. Deluded by the marvel hypeThis is what happens when the hype is too big. What was MJ's line on disappointment? Yeah it applies to this film.My 4 main issues...1. Ned mastering the Doctor Strange Ring instantly (0 training)\n2. Peter's decision to steal the cube from doctor strange because he wanted to \"cure\" a few villains and consequently risk his universe\n3. Needed a few more scenes where the spidermen fight in unison ( we got 10 seconds of them swinging together)\n4. Tobey's entrance was lame and should've been utilised during the end fight.",

    "reviewBody": "It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says \"I'm something of a scientist myself.\" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)",

The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking. But this scene and others like it feel so forced and does not happen naturally.The spells and how they backfire make zero sense..but we could debate that all day.I feel like the most wasted opportunity was to not bring Gwen Stacy back from the dead to reunite with Garfield Spiderman. Everyone else was dead .its not a leap to say Gwen could come back too. And of Course No James Franco...a huge wasted opportunity.Overall not the best marvel movie. But not the worst.",

    "reviewBody": "Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters \"Uncle Ben\" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!",

This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels. I'm not really chomping at the bit to see where this story goes next, but it was fun enough seeing this movie with my 10 year old son.Grade: B.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spectacular.",
    "reviewBody": "Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.",

For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long \"trailer\", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.",

    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man: No Way Home had the potential to be great, but everything didn't really mesh together as it should've. Tobey and Maguire's Spider-Mans didn't really feel like the same versions from all those years ago, or at least that's what I feel. And the villains were all meh except for Doc Oc and Green Goblin, but even these villains weren't as great as they were before. Everything feels watered down in my opinion, and the stakes were just not high enough for me to take enough interest.There are some nice nostalgia scenes and good action pieces, but that's pretty much it. The acting feels cheesy most of the time and there's way too much crying, some people may not mind the amount of crying, but they are really trying to exaggerate the emotions.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a decent movie, 5/10 - 6/10; nowhere near an 8.5. It had the concept but not the execution. It all seems more like nostalgia-bait more than anything. It is worth a watch at the end of the day, so I'd give it a recommendation to all the Spider-Man fans.",

For example, I honestly found the previous Spiderman movie to be mostly pretty boring. But this one...this is amazing! The way both of the previous Spidermen, as well as pretty much all the major villains, from the old movies, all feature in this (they don't just make cameos, they are actively part of the story!), and are ALL played by the original actors, is just so incredibly awesome! They even throw in Daredevil and Venom cameos! Then add on the fact that they actually try to SAVE all the villains rather than kill them...It's just fantastic...If you're a Spiderman fan, or a superhero fan, this is a mut-watch, and if you're not, you should see it anyway!",

    "reviewBody": "This film... it's going to be the topic of every conversation for the years to come.Obviously, we all kinda expected what was going to happen in this movie.Yet, we all wanted to see it with our own eyes.And it did happen:\nTHREE SPIDER-MAN'S! That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)\nMy personal review here:\nI'll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland's Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three \"Spider-Men\" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn't take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, \"yeah, you are the second one\".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:\n\"Oh my god, this is going to be epic af\"\n\"This will probably be the most important film of our generation\".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:\nThey did it again...\nThey took the characters we've loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi's mistake. They put so many villains that they didn't know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man's.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn't say a word to him?)\n(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)\nThey gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must \"cure\" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just \"vanished\", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man's in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire? And I'm not talking about his age, I'm talking about how unexpressive and autistic he looks and talks in this movie.Was that scripted?My final words in this review:\nSeeing the old Spider-Man's on the big screen again was something too beautiful, but it wasn't \"epic\".But it could have been.It could've been the most glorious movie we ever saw in our lives...\nBut, the film industry does not focus on good stories nowadays.",

    "reviewTitle": "Trying to do better.",
    "reviewBody": "Tobey Maguire's trilogy remains indelible, from its origin story, the pitch-perfect sequel, and the messy conclusion. It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (\"You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.\"). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'. He's too cool for that.This universe's Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn't delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don't hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it's not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it's genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May's final wish, but what of the 'villains'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter's grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May's world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don't need 'fixing', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It's a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There's nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don't care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It's screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It's now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can't just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield's Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen's death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I'm unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: \"It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable.\" I think we do deserve these films. We've supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we've been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn't feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there's a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland's Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.",

    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -\nMovie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*",

    "reviewTitle": "Tries really hard, but only reminds of better Spiderman films",
    "reviewBody": "After the animated Spider-Man - Into the Spider-Verse, it was an incredibly smart business move by Sony to attempt something similar with their new Spider-Man movie. And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn't bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:\nThe Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire's Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield's, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in \"bathos\" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or \"what is happening?\" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield's films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I'm glad they didn't throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland's protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.",

It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters.

Know matter how bad he wants things to be better for Peter.PROBLEM 2: Now all of a sudden we can cure evil in our villains?! I found this to be ridiculous. Complete incompetence of Peter to just not hit the button and send these villains back to their universe. Way too much of a gamble to just keep all the villains around while he creates some drugs to cure mental illness.",

    "reviewTitle": "Messy but emotional",
    "reviewBody": "NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you \"hey, I'm here, remember?\". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It's not a perfect film. It's still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.",

    "reviewTitle": "Underwhelming, Relies too Much on Nostalgia",
    "reviewBody": "As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of \"we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important\". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can \"cure\" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.",

The McGuire Spider-man tells the Garfield Spider-man that he is amazing repeatedly. That was such a call-back to the previous movie titles that it motivated me to take a bathroom break.Since there are going to be multiple movies with multiverse as a key plot device, I am ending my interest in the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "This movie was so insanely good; Best Spider-Man film ever (Yes, seriously)",
    "reviewBody": "This is it. It's what we've all been waiting for. This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it's the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official \"With great power, comes great responsibility\". Nice meme material, \"You know, I'm something of a scientist myself\" and \"my back\". The fan service here didn't feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn't the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange's skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-\"redemption arc\". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men bring in helping Holland's Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire's goodbye in the movie \"You know. It's what we do\" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it's one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn't the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.",

Saving Mj part look too easy and fast ,should put slowmo and flashback like last time Andrew scene. Willem Dafoe nail the whole show with his performance.

The plot I must say is quite infuriating, they have taken this no killing thing way too far and have decided to make the Tom holland peter a very annoying kid. Perhaps it is because it is the first major film in phase 4, but if they want to create an event to introduce the antagonist in phase 4 at least let it be something cool and not some stupid teenager's stupid mistake. If I were to summarize the film briefly it will be tom\" Peter tried to do good, but caused a lot of harm on the way, and in the end he actually didn't do any good, it also seems he have brought in even more problem.\"",

    "reviewBody": "The anticipation for the movie was second to only Avengers: Endgame. So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn't disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was expertly presented as 'the baddie'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can't write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter's is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it's just three different Peter's, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange's abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter's suggestion? Surely he's smart enough to know that Peter wouldn't want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter's and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn't \"change\" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he's in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn't have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn't even mentioned by Holland's Parker after Maguire's Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.",

The whole plot was a flop to be honest, I can't understand why they would even go for it. I mean the idea was great but the execution was terrible esp the introduction of the two spideys. And how in the world did Spidey outsmart Dr Strange in his own world, but he couldn't handle a mere human like Green Goblin?! And he was able to scoop up MJ and make a run for it but he couldn't pick up Aunt May and rush her to the hospital? Absolutely childish.

    "reviewTitle": "Great Escapist fun and entertaining",
    "reviewBody": "My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home\nMy Rating 8/ 10I've never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there's a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It's amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn't realise that Ru Paul's often used quote \"With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen 👑 have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics\nOf course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it's the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker's girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she's delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony's own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you'll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.",

    "reviewBody": "Ohh man, what a ride. This movie is a dream come true for me. So Spider-man: No Way Home, before I write this let me collect my thoughts. I would say my review might be a lot partial, I have watched this movie 5 times in theatres in every format available. The movie is everything everyone wanted. Jon Watts 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 you really outdid yourself from the prequels. Let's start with the main crew. Tom Holland, I haven't been a big fan of his spider-man since his take felt a bit childish in the previous movies, but I gotta change my opinion now since, man he felt like a real Peter Parker this time. The Peter Parker known to make sacrifices for the greater good, he was perfect, from the initial childish role to maturing by the end of the movie, it felt unreal. Zendaya, she is just perfect, the best MJ - Michelle Jones that is, but his and Tom's chemistry is perfect, they are made for each other and so are their characters. Ned played a perfect supporting role. And the villains, nobody is better than Willem Dafoe. I guess they all redeemed themselves in a way. Especially Electro, \"I thought you were black\". Oh yeah, Dr. Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch, his and Peter's were nothing but amusing.Now moving on to the story. The daredevil cameo was quick in a rather fully loaded movie. The villains came and started wreaking havoc. Peter \"Tom\" got the line that he deserved when Aunt May dies by the hand of the Goblin. That rage that he felt I could relate to the character so much. The way his friends tried to help him, especially MJ. And then the entry of the two Peter's. Andrew was perfect. I loved him, cause I am from the generation who saw him as the Spider-man. He was amazing, just awesome. Whereas Tobey, his presence felt unreal. I never thought I would be so happy seeing him. And the conclusion and the way the Peters worked together that was the best one of the best action sequences ever. The way they made memes real and yes they talked about the webs, you know how it is produced inside Tobeys Peter. I loved how the conclusion came about where Tobey taught Tom's Peter to not cross the line and stay true to his hero name. And finally when Strange reversed the spell, where Peter made the decision of making everyone forget about him, to save his loved ones. The scene in the bakery where Peter decides not to tell MJ who he is and the new suit. The movie is perfect.IF NOT WATCHED YET, WATCH IT, PLEASE WATCH IT.",

Tobey even acting as the senior most and guiding Andrew through relationships and the best part Tobey putting himself between Tom and goblin to prevent Tom from running into the path of vengeance. I've seen the movie twice in 12 hours but couldn't shake the emotions I felt for the three of them the first time.

Oh and the fact they killed Aunt May?! I can't believe they had the guts to do that. Poor Peter has lost everyone he's ever loved. And that ending! I have so many questions about what happens next for him. How do you live when nobody knows you exist? Movie was just fantastic. Perfect fan-service, nostalgic, heartbreaking, intense, and hilarious. Everyone was perfectly presented and got the necessary screen time (which endgame failed to properly do). I hope to never forget tonight and the way this made me feel. Thank you Marvel and Sony for redeeming Andrew's Spider-Man and bringing together the holy trinity. I still can't believe they did it.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie can be said as one of the best film in the world. I mean like 'What a time to be alive!' for the fans of Spider-Man who grew up watching all the Spider-Man films in the cinema. It was a masterpiece combination of all Spider-Man films.When Doc. Otto Octavius first appeared in the movie and asked Spider-Man about his Machine of the power of sun, I was speechless and moreover, all the actors who played the role of villains of past Spider-Man films were still looking fit like they looked in the past films of Spider-Man.Another moment when I was speechless was when Andrew and Tobey showed up in the movie. Some of the scenes of three of them were quite entertaining like when they were talking about the villains they have fought and referring to all past Spider-Man films which gave me Nostalgic feeling of my childhood.The direction work done by Jon Watts was amazing but there was not much in the story plot when we compare it with Far From Home or EndGame, but still it was entertaining.This movie made the audience laugh, cry, feel angry, shock, feel nostalgic and much more so overall this movie is one of the best film ever made on the Earth.*BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY ELECTRO (MAX) WAS IN THE FILM AS HE DIDN'T KNEW THAT PETER PARKER IS SPIDER-MAN?*They should have been cast Dane DeHaan in the place of Jamie Fox as Harry Osborn (Green Goblin) knew that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.(Still saying it again) This film was totally entertaining for all Spider-Man fans!",

    "reviewBody": "Yes, it doesn't make sense to only bring 2 spider-men from another 2 universes and villains that also were in those 2 movies, but Marvel here just tried to revive the past, remind us with Toby who we were raised by him. Andrew who's just amazing. And Tom who's Tony Stark's trainee. I loved every detail in it, I liked how Toby is still decent, polite, He's just our spider man who raised us to do what's right no matter what's the cost. And you always have a 2nd chance to be good. On other hand, Tom taught us that with great powers comes great responsibility, and we should never seek revenge and do the right thing. I love all of them and I hope to see TASM3 soon as Andrew really deserves it. And when I say the best I've ever seen, It's really the best I've ever seen. Hopefully Dr. MOM top this movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Better Than The Previous 2 Films, But Still Not A Patch On The Originals!",
    "reviewBody": "So, I've come back from a screening of this tonight & have to say I'm surprised! I didn't think I'd hate or dislike it as much, but at the same time, I wasn't wowed either despite the returns of the original characters from the other & Universes!The film picks up exactly from where the last Spider-Man Film left off! Peter Parker is accused of murder & must try to clear his name while simultaneously go to college with his best mate & girlfriend, which they all fail to do, so with the help of Doctor Strange he tries to brainwash the world so they can all go to the same college together! But something in the spell goes wrong & causes the other universes (other franchises to us) to come into their world, this means the original Villains & other Peters & they must fight off these villains & put them back where they came from, but this Peter has other ideas...!I found the film to be overall interesting, I mean it still suffers from the same issues the first 2 films of Tom Hollands Spider-Man does, you know, characters aren't how they're portrayed in the originals, dumb goofiness, other characters being added in, muddied story-line & sub plots/characters & overly long runtime with dragged comedic scenes which take away from the seriousness!But aside from that, surprised, this film introduces the old characters & what's more, they're the original actors from Tobey McGuire's Spider-Man & the rebooted Andrew Garfield Spider-Man! While weird it somehow worked just about & the story wasn't too bad either!However, the film is 2hrs & 15mins too long! It drags there's scenes which are too dumb to be in the film which take away from the seriousness! While I liked the return of the original Spider-Mans it felt dumb & weird to some extend & that it wasn't its own film, like with the previous 2 films...!Overall, it's a good film to an extent, but it's not amazing! 6/10!",

Willem Dafoe's performance alone is worth the price of admission. He is unbelievably good in this movie. Andrew Garfield is perfect. Tobey Maguire is perfect. Tom Holland has always been great and this is his best performance. Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are perfect. Cimenatography stunning. Script is once in a lifetime. They do so much in this movie and they pull off all of it. Comedy beats are wonderful and often ingenious. Drama is heartwrenching and believable. Instantly relatable. We don't deserve a movie this good. This movie didn't have to be this good. But it is and I love it.Does it have any faults? The story doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's okay.

Simply, the movie starts with some kids including Peter want to admit to the university, but they are unsuccessful, because everyone knows Peters identity. Peter goes to Dr. Strange and asks him everyone forget who he was, so he lives a peaceful life. Dr. Strange messed up and brought all these creatures to earth, so they caught all of them and wanted to send them back home. Meanwhile, now Peter is against Dr. Strange because some of them might die, because fate is fate. Peter released them, so I stopped watching this nonsense movie just there. I don't really care if entire world got crazy and think that it's the best movie, for me it's just empty and nonsense movie ever.",

    "reviewTitle": "Greatest of the Tom Holland Spiderman Franchise, By A Mile!",
    "reviewBody": "A certified crowd pleaser, No Way Home had me grinning from ear to ear with my finger pointed at the screen far too often. It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.",

But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was.",

    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man is fantastic for 2 hours out of it 2.5 hour run-time. The finale certainly dwindles but that isn't the biggest fault. The problem for me was with it's over-abundant fan service and the disingenous marketing surrounding the movie.I don't usually mark spoilers but it feels necessary here. It felt like this was supposed to be the film that got the multiverse started beyond the Loki series, and it truly doesn't. It is an entirely self-contained story. Even the venom tease from venom 2 post credits does not come to fruition, and instead, just passes through to another post credits scene to further tease.The film did have mostly positives across the board which kept it at an 8 for me. In particular, I think this is the best sound design in a Marvel film to date. The punches, terrain shattering, and dialgoue were so crisp and distinct. The sound scape just felt right in every scene and I would love Christopher Nolan to take some notes prior to directing his next thriller.",

    "reviewTitle": "Characterization, nostalgia and fan service done right. No Way Home is easily the best thing in MCU Phase 4.",
    "reviewBody": "As a long time fan of The MCU since its inception back in 2008, Phase 4 has been wholly disappointing. Even the stuff I enjoyed had elements in them that kept it from being good, let alone great. Granted, I haven't seen everything in Phase 4 yet (a couple of Disney+ series I have yet to watch) but it's hard to muster up the excitement when you're consistently being let down by a franchise that you once revered. One of my main criticisms has been the world-building, particularly when it comes to the multiverse; the lazy writing and the incohesive melding of this expansion of the universe to what came before. So when it was revealed that the next Spider-Man movie will have multiverse shenanigans as they'll be bringing old villains from previous non-MCU spidey films as well as rumours that the spider-men themselves might make an appearance, I was a bit apprehensive about that news, especially considering how established characters have been treated going forward whether in the MCU or in other franchises which is probably the biggest criticism I have with Phase 4. Also, the fact that nostalgia baiting and keychain jangling have been the norm for a while now certainly wasn't helping the anticipation levels either. So imagine my surprise when this movie simply said \"Hey fam. Fret not. We got this.\" Suffice to say I had an exhilarating experience and it reminded me of why I used to love the MCU.Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) picks up right where Far From Home ended with Spider-Man's identity now revealed to the world and him being framed as the one who killed Quentin Beck or Mysterio; now Peter and his friends have to deal with the fallout. The entire first act was the weakest part of the movie as I was not engaged or entertained to the extent I wanted to be or I wasn't \"feeling\" it even if there was entertainment to be had; Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock from Netflix's Daredevil making his MCU debut appearance to help Spidey being a notable highlight (the entire one-shot scene before that was dope too). This was mainly due to the messy and rushed writing at crucial plot points to get the rest of the story going, particularly Dr Strange (one of my favourite MCU characters) coming off like an idiot with the handling of the spell when at this point in the MCU he should know better. However, when the main plot kicks in due to the spell going awry, the movie started getting better and didn't let up till the end and surprised me in the best of ways.Now, I had only watched one main trailer but unfortunately, the rumour about other spider-men making an appearance being true was spoiled for me since I wasn't able to watch it in theatres. What I was not privy to, thankfully, was in what capacity were they gonna be in the movie nor most of the plot details and how it pans out, so I was ecstatic when it turned out that both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are not just cameos but full-fledged secondary characters. Similarly, the villains had a much bigger role and presence than what I had assumed from the trailer, particularly Doc Ock and Green Goblin, and it was glorious.The thing I loved the most was how director Jon Watts, who has now successfully helmed all the Spidey movies in the MCU, and the writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were able to meticulously take the meta-narrative and pop culture sentiments of both the Raimi Trilogy and The Amazing Spider-Man duology, write it into the plot of this universe while maintaining the integrity of what came before and give the old characters new arcs where they can grow, all the while making sure that Tom Holland's Spidey remains the central focus. In other words, the characterization was sublime. Mad props for achieving this and setting a prime example of how to effectively utilize nostalgia and fan service. It also goes to show that if you can nail down your characters, then the weight of faults in other areas reduces drastically.The actors didn't hold back either. This was the best performance from Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Zendaya as MJ, and this was the best depiction of them as a couple (Andrew and Emma are still my favourites). Tobey Maguire felt right at home as the oldest Spidey who has the most experience and hence, the most wisdom. Alfred Molina was once again wonderful as Doc Ock, particularly when Peter fixes the neural inhibitor chip; the performance, the FEELS. Jamie Fox and Rhys Ifans were having a blast as Electro and Lizard considering how these villains were treated in the TASM movies. But the ones who stole the show were Willem Dafoe and Andrew Garfield. What a performance by both of them. Willem felt as if he had time travelled from the set of Spider-Man (2002) and jumped straight into No Way Home with his nuanced dual-personality performance and the madlad at his age did most of the stunts which not only shows but adds even more menace to every scene he was in. Garfield getting a second chance at being Spidey after the failure of TASM and utilizing that in every single scene to his best had me smiling and riddled with FEELS.Speaking of emotions, I was not expecting this movie to move me several times to the extent that I was tearing up. I love all three renditions of live-action Spider-Man even though, granted, some of the movies aren't good in retrospect. It was absolutely surreal witnessing them together and interacting with each other, whether real talk or fun banter. Same case with the villains. I loved the interplay, I loved the banter, I loved the interactions no matter how small or big and I wish there was more. I also greatly appreciated the restraint on the typical MCU humour during serious scenes where many other movies have failed to do so by undercutting tension willy nilly. My favourite scene was probably when Tobey and Andrew first meet Tom and console him; man tears abound.Technically, this was a solid production. The de-ageing effects were great (Marvel has kinda perfected it by this point), the visual effects were pretty good even if not mindblowing, and there was some beautiful cinematography at display in certain scenes such as Peter mourning the loss of Aunt May in the rain. The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino was beautiful whether it's the revamped MCU Spidey theme, the incorporations of older themes or new tracks for this film.Regarding faults, as mentioned earlier, the writing when it came to the plot and how some of its mechanics worked was weak and made some characters appear stupid. Not all characters had similar levels of characterization and the one that stood out the most was Sandman whose actions, later on, contradicted his motivations as well as where we last saw his character in Spider-Man 3. The humour, while relatively restrained and landing in a lot of areas did fall flat sometimes.Overall, I was in a blissful state by the time this movie ended having been reminded why I used to enjoy the MCU. Tom Holland Peter makes the biggest sacrifice as a true Hero would, ending on a bittersweet note, and it felt as if instead of having a single origin movie, MCU Spidey got to have three to come at a place where he can now carry forward as the classic Spidey, and it's character writing like this that MCU should be focusing on in other properties too since it is what made it famous in the first place. You can have all the crazy plots and scenarios as you want but if the characters inhabiting them are not interesting and consistent, well then you can say goodbye to long term investment. Had the movie done what so many others have done with nostalgia and fan service, this would have been a completely different review. Even though it's not the tightest in terms of writing in the Jon Watts Spidey Trilogy (Homecoming takes that one), it's my favourite. I sure do hope that Doctor Strange 2 doesn't take the wrong lessons from this success. And if I were to rate this, I'd give it an 8.5/10.",

This is mostly because of the emotional connection and depth they delve into between the Peters. They found a way to make all the stories we've seen before tie together (albeit loosely) to further help develop Holland's character journey. This was more the surprise for me.

    "reviewTitle": "First film I've seen at the theater in over two years...",
    "reviewBody": "I believe the last film I watched at the theater was that Lion King remake, but before that it was Spider-man Far From Home. I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.",

Spider-Man man is no longer Spider-Man! Is Iron Boy! Tom Holland must be the worst actor to play this role of Spidey Boy! Zendaya is the worst actress i have ever seen! The only good things in the movie was some special effects and Tobey Maguire apareance! Now this..thing is in top 17 movies of all times based on ratings, above real masterpieces, and this make me lose faith in humanity!",

They handle the question of revenge so great I think. The ending is just yeah phenomenal. I don't even know what to say barely left the theater before I started to write this both Tobey and Andrew back. (sorry Nicholas Hammond maybe next time). If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs. It is great watch it if you haven't. Honestly you shouldn't even read this if you haven't watched it.",

    "reviewBody": "My review is contrary to popular belief. There were high expectations for this movie, and after careful thought, I am not satisfied with how it turned out.As trailers were being released, I only watched the first one because I did not want to risk seeing too much considering the Sinister Six was hinted at (except for the mystery sixth member). But that was pivoted to essentially every villain for himself situation for majority of the movie and made for a loose story.The story did not hit home for me. Spider-Man was essentially trying to save the villains from themselves by curing them. The cure essentially would take all their powers away and all that would be left is just a human. To me, this made Spider-Man the antagonist.There was one part of the movie that I truly enjoyed and that was when Doc Ock first appeared on the bridge (also shown in the trailer). That entire sequence was edge of your seat worthy. But then as the movie progressed, it became too predictable which took away from the edge of your seat feel.One thing that really bothers me about the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies is his web swinging in New York. We have yet to really see that happen despite this is his sixth appearance on the big screen. That is one of the most exciting parts of Spider-Man is seeing his web swinging throughout New York City, and the audience finally got it but only for approximately 15 seconds.Sony and Marvel should have done a better job with producing a story which showed the Sinister Six instead of their tactic of bait and switch.",

    "reviewBody": "I was really looking forward to this one because the concept seemed interesting. They could have done something really cool with the whole identity-reveal thing, but instead it veered off into extremely confusing territory.In the earlier Tom Holland movies, the interactions between Peter and his friends from school is what gives the movies life, but here their relationship fell a bit flat. All their lines are so cliche and difficult to take seriously.But the biggest problem is the nonsensical character motivation. Each and every one of the inciting incidents made zero sense. First of all, why would Peter go to Dr Strange over some college applications? Secondly, why would Dr Strange cast such a dangerous spell over something of so little consequence? And thirdly, why would Peter think it was a good idea to try to save some random villains from a different dimension??? I mean, they'd have to go back anyway, and even if he manged to change them, he has no idea what happens to them when he sends them back, or how that changes the dimension that they came from.It was cool to see the other Spider-men, but it felt a bit like that was this movie's only focus. In the end Peter changed everything back anyway, so does this movie contribute to anything in the MCU at all??? I feel like after this movie, litterally nothing has changes except that everyone who ever knew Peter Parker must have a very confusing jumble of memories. Like, how does that even work out? *sigh*",

    "reviewTitle": "\"You wouldn't happen to be from another universe, would you?\"",
    "reviewBody": "I believe this film entered IMDb's 'Top 250' at number #9, briefly rose to #8, and has now settled down into the 17th spot as I write this, right between \"The Matrix\" and \"Goodfellas\". I go on this little rant every time a new comic book super-hero movie comes out, because in anyone's wildest imagination, this cannot possibly be the 17th best movie of all time. Not that it will stay there as time goes by, but it just boggles my mind how a movie's audience and IMDb voters can impact a film's standing when it first comes out. Anyway, enough of that.For me, I thought the picture was quite a fun and entertaining experience. The idea of the two former Spider-Man actors returning to the big screen to help out Tom Holland's current depiction of the character was just a marvelous touch. Combined with many of the past Spidey villains and that quick cameo by Charlie Cox as Attorney Matt Murdoch made this an exciting and unexpected pleasure. Anywhere else the whole multiverse concept could have been a huge bungle, but the screenwriters here did a competent job of melding the disparate universes into a cohesive story that didn't seem far fetched within the context of Spider-Man's comic book history.With over four thousand reviews already posted here for this movie, there's not a whole lot I'm able to add to the discussion. Just know that if you go see this movie, it will quite likely exceed your expectations via creative story telling and superb visual effects. In other words, it's what you go to the theater for.",

    "reviewBody": "This first part's not about the movie itself but the experience I had which I'll now always associate with the movie now. Okay so I bought 4DX tickets and it was my first time, it's crazy man. The seat started moving around like a roller coaster, wind was blowing, when the scene was somewhere cold in the movie the cinema got cold all of a sudden, water was being sprinkled everywhere, chair was vibrating and moving all over my back. The wind and water was coming from different directions, hit me behind my ears, in my face from the from the seat infront, from the sides, under and behind my ankles. I expected it, but was still really stunned. And I got a large Pepsi which I finished in about 20min and didn't pee before the movie, which is 3hr long if you consider the cinema ads in the beginning, so halfway through I had to pee really bad and the seat was throwing me around, my bladder hurt so bad😂 didn't want to miss a thing so I had to wait for the movie to end and people were staring at me all weird 'cause I was the only one leaving since we all wait for the post credit scenes😂 there are two of them.But my outtake from the movie, what stood out the most to me is Tom Halland is really good at playing sad scenes, every time I see him sad or crying I feel like I wanna cry too, the African in me doesn't allow it but I do. That Andrew Garfield scene also made me wanna cry. Spider-Man's not one of my favorite heroes but I think this is one of the best movies marvel has made so far, and I love how each of the Spider-Mans all brought back the same feeling their individual movies had back then, it was great to see. Not really a complaint but I wasn't really convinced Dr. Strange was that oblivious to the consequences of what he and Spider-Man were doing, he accepted doing the favour way too easily and didn't seem surprised when everything went haywire; and can't really blame it on the acting because Cumberbatch is astounding so I'll assume it's a \"giving thanos the time stone\" kinda situation. Unlike some MCU movies, this one didn't make the fan theories seem bonkers.The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 rating even after being released a couple days but it is as good as they say.",

    "reviewBody": "I hate Marvel movie and in this case I could've just lie and say I hate this movie too but no, I'm actually a little impressed of what they've done here. I love how this movie took a more playful route, the comedy is alive and although I dont think they're funny they're consistent and its giving the impression that the movie doesnt take itself very seriously. I like that better compared to their previous serious approach. Problems like plotholes and things that are just came to be are still here but it's somewhat justified because the whole plot makes no sense in the first place and so these plotholes are just a shortcut to get the characters to interact with each other and I'm honestly fine with that, its a movie where a grown man pretending to have superpowers anyway. Much of the films are nostalgia bait and much of them are effectively done. Instead of just referencing them they actually put some effort into creating something new but similar and incorporate bits from the past. Although some didn't turn well and come of as cringe like when aunt May died and she said great responsibility power thingy stuff, that was just cringe. Still the story here is the same old brain dead virtuous tripe and some actors are badly miscast, like Jamie Foxx. And there's no reason for this movie to be over 2 hours long. Anyway its a major improvement to the previous two Jon Watts' Spider-man. And I really wish they took more of this playful route and just embrace the goofiness of the superhero genre instead of trying to be all preachy and inspiring.",

    "reviewBody": "While I could say that the movie was complete garbage for the majority, it was the salvation from a 1star film by Dafoe, Garfield, McGuire, and Cumberbach. However many of the jokes fall flat on their face, many of the moments that should've felt like \"achievement\" felt like participation award simply for doing. Even then there are so many holes to fill that do not make sense. Without spoiling it in a absolute way, there are also some serious questions about some of what happened that really are bad.I believe most people will love this simply for it's touch of nostalgia, I don't believe it merits a worthy enough film simply based on that. I felt that everything seemed so rushed and smashed together that I am sure I missed elements that may also come into question that I didn't catch. As for the ones I did, believe me it's bad. I especially didn't care for the racial comment in it but regardless, I felt that the 5stars are warranted for the nostalgia and performance by those special few.The fact is that also this didn't understand Peter Parker, Spider-Man, or any of the villains. It was very much in question what kind of nonsensical idiot would've done some of the things they do in this film along with everything \"just so happened\" to be just the thing/action/power they needed. This was a win for Tony Stark, and Starktech but for Spiderman this was barely mediocre - thank Toby and Andrew for saving this movie from the fire.",

This movie starts with peter parker at his flashy iron spider persona and ends with (spoiler alert) peter parker we all know and love(aka like tobey and andrew's). The plot is weak and electro(from TASM 2) who never knew the identity of Spider-Man in first place is.... just there for fan service and nostalgia. The serious moments get ruined by forced cringe jokes but otherwise the movie is fun and enjoyable. That being said, i am happy that its a reset movie(although with forced and weak plot but that's understandable) and now we will get to see the true Spider-Man in tom holland's next trilogy of 4-6. This homecoming trilogy falls weak to the previous two takes but i am hopeful that next trilogy will top the tobey's trilogy in the future now that he would NOT be assistant to some C-lister.CGI on this movie especially on lizard and sandman is also crap. They reused scenes from TASM and S-M 3. That's really not good and feels like a cheap powerpuff girls movie.",

This movie truly has everything a good \"superhero\" movie can have. Lots of great friendship and love scenes, fight scenes and those really, really intense scenes. But the thing that makes this movie stand out the most is because spiderman carries the sense of humanity. This movie made me cry, laugh, irritated and even a little bit angry sometimes and that's what makes it so great. The emotions made it the best spiderman movie so far. One moment that really made me cry was when Garfield (spiderman 3) catches MJ, not wanting Holland (spiderman 1) to feel the same sorrow he felt for Gwen. I also feel like you get the most out of this movie if you've watched all of the spiderman movies made, it gets you really sentimental.If you haven't seen this movie yet then you really have to as soon as you can, one of the best movies i've seen this year.",

Even just for a small moment. Didn't need to take away Tom's shine at all. The director or Marvel says, hey let's give him a moment with Doc Ock! It's just really mind boggling how they go out of their way to be mediocre. This movie is just as bad as the other films of the trilogy. It's boring. It's depressing. Peter in this movie is very annoying and unbelievably naive, even for what most people will say is excusable because he's \"just a kid.\" No one cared enough for this Aunt May to die as much as we would have cared for the Aunt May from Tobeys universe because we felt their connection. Lets be honest the relationship with Happy was weird. Happy crossed a major boundary slamming Peter's aunt. Totally uncomfortable. If anyone thinks I should be grateful because at least we see all three generations of Spidey on screen, I don't understand the logic. If I get free ice cream and it tastes like dog turd I'm not gonna be thrilled and say \"hey at least it's free ice cream!\" Im allowed to say what I dislike.

    "reviewTitle": "A masterful, emotional roller-coaster",
    "reviewBody": "\"Where do we go from here?\" is the biggest question I have after leaving the cinema. The possibilities are endless both for Spiderman and the MCU as a whole.Firstly, this movie absolutely delivers on so many levels. So often, the hype for a film could leave you disappointed but not this one. Fan service is at the very core of No Way Home but at the same time it ties in beautifully to what we're seeing with this new phase of MCU projects.With all the craziness, epic moments, secrets and reveals, I was worried this movie will take the attention away from Tom Holland's Spiderman but if anything it just adds to his story arch and sets up an amazing potential future for the character. I honestly can't wait to see what comes next for Spiderman and Peter Parker. Holland does a fantastic job and we really get to see just how good of an actor he is in this movie. No Way Home is filled with fantastic visuals and plenty of emotion, and in classic MCU style, thrilling action, your usual one liners and (not always, but definitely in this film) a storyline that keeps the Marvel steam train running at full force.There are many scenes in this film that will leave long time Spidey fans feeling like a kid again and is exactly what you'd expect it to be. The feeling of joy, nostalgia, excitement and to some extent, relief, was truly magical and I'm forever grateful to have experienced it. It would be extremely difficult to ever witness something like this on the big screen again. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Sony.In my opinion, there are some areas in the film 's storyline where it suffers a bit. Some of the character's decisions are a bit Strange (no pun intended) in parts with certain events being questionable. But then again, that's the tricky part with these films. It's science fiction and you can never read too much into the details. Sometimes its best to just accept it for what it is, which in this case, is an epic superhero adventure.Despite the VERY minor questionable plot details, No Way Home is undoubtedly a phenomenal film that will go down as one of the greatest superhero films of all time. It is a true love letter to Spiderman fans and an event that will surely open up a multitude of possibilities for the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "A resurrection",
    "reviewBody": "Definitely an amazing movie. The reunion was so special to see, it was wonderful to see the previous 2 spidermans in this movie. I really, really loved it. It proves that it is not always bad to bring back some of the elements, characters or even actors from the previous movies. It takes skill to implement old elements, treat them with respect and make them turn out great in a new movie. The fact that Andrew's Peter Parker saved this universe's MJ was a touch that must have had long-time fans (me included) grabbing for tissues.Other than that I can't wait to see the next movie. I think Tom is a great Spiderman, though all 3 of the actors are the best Spiderman, there simply isn't one who is better than the other. They all portrayed the character in amazing but different ways and it's lovely to see them together to notice their impact.Furthermore, all performances in this movie were great, I really can't think of any bad points in this movie. Definitely recommend watching.",

    "reviewTitle": "Awesome spectacle",
    "reviewBody": "This review contains spoilers.The Avengers is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Joss Whedon, produced by Kevin Feige, screenplay by Joss Whedon. The story is written by Zak Penn, and Joss Whedon. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston. Loki launches an invasion of Earth leading the heroes of the Earth to band together and stop the invasion.The Avengers is a great action movie. The movie incorporates the grand visuals found in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and combines them for one spectacle featuring the heroes that we know and love. The movie focuses on the spectacle rather than having a complex narrative focusing on specific characters. In this way it is more of a large set piece with pre-existing characters rather than a full narrative movie. The spectacle is impressive to watch with the ending battle in New York City being the highlight. The scenes leading up to that moment are impressive as the heroes band and fight amongst each other. The movie is about the heroes as a whole rather than individuals.The Avengers has great chemistry with its leads. Not only does the audience see visually impressive action but also the dynamic between the superheroes. The movie relishes in the heroes it has on display and it is a treat to watch for comic book fans. Audiences can see the heroes have their quarrel and what happens when Thor's hammer hits Captain America's shield. The story concerns the heroes and it is believable that Nick Fury's Avengers squad would not get along at first. It makes for an interesting story as the squad eventually overcomes their differences and begins to work together. This is a classic trope that is applied to a superhero story.The flaw of this movie is that Loki has not been built up as a massive villain before. Loki always seemed more like a joker and a specific villain for Thor rather than a large scale villain that spanned into Iron Man and Captain America's stories. I still enjoyed Tom Hiddleston's performance and watching him on the screen is sure to delight.I would recommend The Avengers.Grade: B.",

    "reviewBody": "The score, the CGI, the writing, the humor, all of it is just top notch!Especially the legendary scene where Tony Stark falls out of the building and the suit activates and builds around him, not a scene to forget. The scenes where he lands at the Stark Tower landing pad and the machines automatically took off his suit is also unforgettable. How all of the agents have different plans, and how this will create conflict, but at the end, when they defeat Loki, they are together again. This movie also serves a major purpose as all of these people have met each other for the first time.If you have watched all of the other Avengers movies, it is pretty funny to see how they have grown with each other. The theme song, composed by Alan Silvestri took this movie to a whole new level. And how this theme song evolved in the later Avengers movies. Even hearing it now gives me chills.",

    "reviewTitle": "A groundbreaking culmination",
    "reviewBody": "The MCU had estavlished itself as an interesting project since the start - there were some hit and miss movies, but it was overall an imaginative concept.Then came the moment everyone had been waiting for, the big culminatiom that had been promised for years - and with Joss Wheadon at the helms, it sure doesn't disappoint.Like the MCU overall, it has a very fun and lighthearted feeling reminiscent of films like Str Wars, which is much appreciated. It is a very colourful cast of different and memorable characters, all memorized by great actors. The main antagonist Loki establishes himself as one of the most interesting and complex movie villains of all time, whether he's tragic, spiteful, mildly heroic or just pure evil, he's a joy to watch.A main draw in these movies, of course, are the effects and action scenes and they sure doesn't disappoint. The movie gives us some of the biggest and most epic scale battles ever seen on the silver screen, and it's simply mind blowing. The cinematography is incredible as well.Overall, a fun and epic movie that was years in the making and once and for all proved how successful the Marvel Cinematic Universe was.",

    "reviewBody": "The best movie of phase 1! This movie was literally perfect. It had a great plot, a great story, great acting, and one of the best villains in the MCU. I thought the way they tied in parts or Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger through the Tesseract was cool. I also liked how the movie centered around Loki and his quest to rule Midgard (Earth), by stealing the Tesseract from a S. H. I. E. L. D base, taking command of Hawkeye, Selvig and Shield agents, and him teaming up with the Chitauri to attack New York and eventually the world. The story and dialogue was even good, I liked how the Avengers would always bicker together, and I also liked the punny jokes. I also loved the fact that the soul reason The Avengers decided to work together was due to the death of Coulson. Like always, the acting by everyone was great, even the new additions. Lastly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. He played the role to perfection again. He is always great and I really hope to see a lot more of him in the future.Like I said, this was the best movie of Phase 1, I recommend this to anyone, even people who haven't seen any MCU movies before.",

    "reviewTitle": "Entertaining if you saw all the other films",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers didn't age well but is a highly entertaining movie regardless of your knowledge of its characters and universe. Sure it's cliche and super predictable just like any other superhero movie, but remember this is nothing that you should take seriously. It's just a big excuse to get all your favorite characters kicking each other's butts on screen with great special effects. Compared to all previous MCU movies it's very well-paced and while being fun and self-mocking it never gets to unbearable peaks of trashiness. The writing was surprisingly well-cared too this time. The characters have good chemistry, and each one of them gets introduced the right way, with the right amount of information being given still without getting too verbose. I still don't think that having Hulk suddenly being able to control his powers is a good idea though. It pretty much kills the whole concept of being indestructible but a threat to anybody around him at the same time. I understand that there are times he can't control himself when under stress like in the first part of the movie, but it's still too much of an easy card to play. Having the Avengers use his powers against the enemies but struggling to keep him in control at the same time would be more believable and balance the game better. Also Loki after being presented as the ultimate bad guy the first half of the movie gets completely lost after the aliens come in. Didn't feel his threat at all.",

There was careful consideration taken in every element, every plotline and every piece of dialogue, which is can be positive but also negative. Because it was such a monumental cinematic moment, it seemed as though the filmmakers were doing everything possible to not mess it up and therefore did not take many risks. That being said, the film itself is fantastic. Seeing Earth's mightiest heroes fight side by side give you goosebumps, there are genuinely funny moments and the plot moves forward logically. However, compared to later films in the MCU, The Avengers just seems a little too safe.",

    "reviewBody": "film studios just found out that a lot of moviegoers rely on \"reviews\" like internet buyers rely on customer reviews. It is known, that many big internet shops hire review-agencies those only job it is to fake authentic looking customer reviews because a lot of buyers trust the reviews of other customers more than any magazine reviews.That's what is happening here. 80% of the reviews here are written by professional review-agencies which got paid by the studios. If you look closer and compare the text of those \"best movie ever\" reviews (or variations of that, such as \"i did not expect much, i am not a superhero fan, but this was greatest beyond belief\" ) with reviews written at other moviegoer platforms, you will find a lot of equal phrases and text blocks.I guess that IMDb is aware of that cheating and they support it. This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end they find together again and etc., etc.. A story for retarded eight-year-old's, flavored with as much CGI as you little brain can swallow in the time.A stupid movie with a stupid story, stupid characters with stupid attitudes, stupid CGI and a stupid ending. If super stupid means blockbuster, then here you go.",

    "reviewTitle": "Are movies so bad now that a film like this is considered great?",
    "reviewBody": "Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like \"The Avengers,\" is heralded as an exceptional film?Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. \"Star Wars,\" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of \"The Avengers\" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of \"Inception\" or \"The Matrix\" or even \"Back to the Future\" or \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where \"The Avengers\" is going. Along these same lines, \"Psycho,\" \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" \"The Matrix,\" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film's apparent killer; Darth Vader, the film's main villain, is revealed to be Luke's father; the first half of \"The Matrix\" turns out to have transpired in a totally false reality. Nobody expected these twists. What unexpected occurs in \"The Avengers\"? Even its minor twists have appeared in other recent films. Its most significant--Loki allowing his own capture--comes straight from \"The Dark Knight.\"Gangster films before \"The Godfather\" were just pulp. \"The Godfather\" transcended the genre just as \"Unforgiven\" did with Westerns. The same is true about \"The Dark Knight.\" \"The Avengers\" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike \"The Avengers,\" \"The Dark Knight\" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that \"The Dark Knight\" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And did anyone NOT know that \"The Avengers\" would end with a huge battle with the Avengers ultimately triumphant? Uncertainty about how a plot will be resolved is what once kept the audience hooked, not the continual spectacle of fights and explosions. In fact, look at the IMDb Top 250. With how many of these films would you know exactly how they'd end if you were seeing them for the first time? In fact, apart from the cartoons, is there a single entry as totally formulaic as \"The Avengers\" is? And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made \"The Dark Knight\" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. And did anyone expect what happened to Rachel Dawes, Harvey Dent's girlfriend? One of the things that made \"Psycho\" so dramatic is its main protagonist dies halfway through the film. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake. And do I even have to go into how voting to give \"The Avengers\" a 10 places it on par with the all-time great works of film art--\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" \"Schindler's List,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"Citizen Kane\", \"Vertigo,\" \"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" \"8 1/2,\" \"Manhattan,\" \"Cinema Paradiso\" etc.? A vote of 10 for a film like this diminishes the worth of these works of art that explore the deepest issues concerning the human condition.Though I've brought up some films that are darker than \"The Avengers\" or more serious, that is not my complaint about \"The Avengers\" at all. \"Star Wars, \" \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" \"Back to the Future,\" \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" were fun movies, but they also had plots that went in unexpected directions, had surprising twists, introduced us to unique characters. The elements I've listed here are what make a film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating. Just a well-done totally formulaic movie like \"The Avengers\" simply does not deserve the praise it is getting. Of course this film does not deserve a 1 out of 10. I would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which is equivalent to a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the IMDb rating scale. However, until others don't alter their votes to put \"The Avengers\" more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining films of history, my vote will remain a 1. Go watch \"The Avengers\" a few more times. Once you've gotten used to the 3-D, the special effects, the digital surround sound, you'll see that the film is predictable, the jokes are so-so, and the violence of the fights and of the long climactic end battle actually gets kind of boring.If you're a teenager still reading comics or a lover of comic books who's always dreamed of watching Hulk fight Thor, Thor fight Iron Man, then this movie is what you've always been waiting for, but for the rest of us, \"The Avengers\" is not the tour de force it's been made out to be. Oh wait a sec. I just learned that there's a movie based on \"Battleship\"--you know, that dull board game for eight-year-olds. I guess movies really are that bad. If you compare \"The Avengers\" only to garbage like that, I guess it really does seem great.Never mind...",

    "reviewBody": "In THE AVENGERS, when the powerful villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) appears on Earth in search of the Tesseract, a mysterious artifact that holds limitless energy, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of the secret organization S. H. I. E. L. D., realizes it's going to take some equally powerful heroes to save the planet. So he calls in the toughest team he can find -- Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), expert archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and skilled assassin Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) -- known collectively as The Avengers. The fate of the planet hangs in the balance ... can Loki be stopped?Quick-witted and nuanced, this movie takes the best of the genre -- iconic heroes fighting for truth and justice -- and dishes it out in a fanboy-pleasing, edge-of-your seat way. Superhero movies are a dime a dozen these days, so when you chance upon a gem like The Avengers, thank the comic book gods. There's great chemistry, especially between loose cannon Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey, perfect as usual) and skittish Bruce Banner (Ruffalo, adding great depth) and also between Stark and the starchy, unquestioning Captain America. The banter is believable, even when it's not always easy. And Hiddleston is a fearsome delight as the insecure, approval-hungry Loki.The Avengers starts with a long-winded set-up -- unavoidable, perhaps, given the characters' many backstories but still mildly annoying -- and the Tesseract at the heart of the conflict soon takes a backseat to the heroes themselves. But no matter: Director Joss Whedon knows his way around compelling, flawed, conflicted superheroes, and he masterfully brings these characters alive in all their complex glory.Best Movie of Phase 1.",

    "reviewTitle": "Fanfare for the Merry Marvel Marching Society!",
    "reviewBody": "Being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on 'COWBOY SAM' books and 'JOHN HENRY AND THE DOUBLE-JOINTED STEAM DRILL' as well 'UNCLE ARTHUR'S BEDTIME STORIES', the adventures of the MARVEL UNIVERSE were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the Sixties and the zeitgeist of that era. Before the Avengers battled the Space Phantom, I cannot remember when I ever encountered a Superhero like the Hulk. Basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others. After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; \"We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools.\" Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking \"-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?\". They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, \"-sort of like Life-\".Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!",

After first battling each other , the Avengers unite and join forces to save the world from the same common enemy . A lot of the action takes place on a gigantic flying aircraft carrier ,No.64 ( not the CV-64 USS Constellation ). This movie consists mostly of very fast paced CGI's and cheesy Iron Man Robert Downey Jr one-liners . Our heroes and (super villain) are practically indestructible as they are beaten to a pulp but always manage to bounce back time after time . I don't know what the Black Widow's super powers were except martial arts and pistol shooting . Some unintentionally funny moments came when Iron Man Downey was speaking from inside his metal suit . It looked like a talking head from inside a goldfish bowl . It just looked so silly ! There isn't much chemistry between these cardboard characters either . If you are 10 years old or an adult with the maturity of a 14 year old boy , who is obsessed with reading comic books, and are addicted to video games, I'm sure the Avengers is your cup of tea . If not, you will be thinking of the 143 boring minutes you just wasted or what other movies were playing next door you could have seen . If you do decide to see this movie , select a seat in the last row to avoid nausea . I would like to see movies that rely so much on CGI's to be made into animated full length cartoons instead . At least the unaware movie goer has a better idea of what is in store for them when they purchase a ticket . This film was definitely not for me ! .... NOT HOT ... pwh",

    "reviewTitle": "\"The world has gotten stranger than you even know.\"",
    "reviewBody": "Well how do I put this across so it doesn't sound like I'm trying to trash the movie? I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that's what you're all about, you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there, he's serious when he has to be, and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this, \"The Avengers\" has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to \"The Avengers\" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it.",

    "reviewBody": "Without a doubt, THE AVENGERS is the most expensive video game ever produced; why the techs would want to try to integrate live-action elements, however, is beyond me: the cartoon was okay without them. Robert Downey has the best lines (half a dozen one-liners, to be precise), though Thor's contention that Loki \"was adopted\" was just as funny. Sam Jackson looks just plain bored throughout- which is saying a lot when one considers the fact that he's the most overrated actor in Hollywood. You know a movie's heavily padded when fully one-third of it could be cut and never missed: the first third of this game is mind-numbingly clichéd and plays out like yet another pseudo-military video game (what used to be called \"first-person shooter\" games but are nowadays referred to as \"first-person action\" games) or television show the likes of which we've seen a thousand times. The skrull at the end was a nice little touch, but I wonder why comics- and now their celluloid incarnations- tend to focus on alien invasions for their \"big get-togethers\" when there are more than enough wannabe tyrants here on Earth...? I think John Carpenter (THEY LIVE) and George Romero (LAND OF THE DEAD) had it right: we have seen The Enemy, and He is Us. Give me RODNEY CECIL, PSYCHO HERO any day.",

    "reviewTitle": "The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema",
    "reviewBody": "The only way this film can be enjoyed is to toss away all expectations of what makes up good cinema and instead go in expecting some cool action, hot chicks and a few wisecracks.In this endeavor it succeeds fairly well; it is in fact almost nonstop action, and it flows well for this purpose. There's hardly a moment of relative boredom or dullness, and it keeps your attention throughout. Pacing is something many films have trouble with and this does it well.The special effects and sound editing were very well-done too. Not once did I think they were overdone or cheesy-looking/-sounding, and they packed a punch. The way the aliens looked was neat, and most of the fighting was cool to watch. What sticks out in my memory is Thor hitting his hammer against Captain America's shield, an awesomely done scene for effects.The humorous one-liners, mostly stemming from Tony Stark but also from the camaraderie among the Avengers group, also work well enough and keep you at least smiling throughout.However, I sensed a strong amount of cold, calculated filmmaking here. I felt almost no style in this entire film, and instead I felt as if Joss Whedon had a quota to fill as he was filming it. It's almost as if he was thinking, \"I need to show what happens during the following encounters: Thor vs. Captain America, Thor vs. Iron Man, Iron Man vs. Loki\", etc., and then later on, many combinations of two or three of the Avengers fighting bad guys together, to contrast their earlier conflicts. I appreciate the contrast that went into that aspect, but it just felt plain robotic the way it was executed. The thought pattern I detected was, \"You damn well can't have an Avengers movie without this happening, and this, and...\" The result of this is that this \"quota\" took the focus and actually enticing filmmaking was put on the backburner. He was simply showing things happening with entirely no flair or style of direction whatsoever. Oh look, here's Iron Man coming in to save the day! He's going to say something funny, don't we know it! Nothing stylish, unexpected or cinematic happens in this entire film. It left a dry taste in my mouth, despite all the cool effects and fighting.The story, along with the direction, was very milquetoast and forgettable. To briefly summarize: Loki, an alien, comes down to Earth to wreak havoc; the Avengers team up and stop him and all the aliens he summons through a giant portal as well. You'd think Nick Fury, being the leader of the Avengers, would take on a more interesting storyline role, but he really doesn't. I was maniacally uninterested in every single scene with him talking to the heads of S.H.I.E.L.D., and beyond that his storyline doesn't really go many places in this film. In fact all the other individual character storylines didn't really go anywhere either, which is okay since this film was a group effort, but the overall group storyline was not very interesting either, basically another rendition of saving the planet. Therefore neither the overarching group storyline nor the individual storylines were very fulfilling, leaving the story as a whole lacking.The script was also extremely dry and poorly written. I feel this was another item that went on the backburner to give the aforementioned \"quota\" more focus. Most of the lines were very uninteresting and without character. One example that stuck out in my mind is Nick Fury saying, \"I'll bet you $10 you're wrong\". People may say this phrase in reality; it's not the realism about it I attack but the character and flair of it. This is a movie; when characters speak they should be saying things that are somewhat relevant, interesting, mysterious, gripping, funny, or any combination thereof. Something that delivers, something with edge or character. Most of the lines in the entire film I have completely forgotten already except ones like the above that I remembered just to point out how uninteresting they are. Just like with the direction, I felt as if the script, too, just had people saying things to move the story along. Very sparsely was any extra style or flair or character added in.Last but entirely not least is the acting, and overall I was disappointed. I'll start with the good: Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny smartass self, and I have no complaints, nor was he exceptional. I also actually quite enjoyed Chris Evans as Captain America; I find him a talented actor who works well in various kinds of films. Also Scarlett Johansson did a great job as usual. I love Stellan Skarsgård; he's a great actor, but I have to admit his placement in the film felt awkward and every time he came on screen I chose to express it through hysterical laughter. Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as Nick Fury but I wasn't very impressed, but I blame that on the script. Now for the bad: The main villain of the film, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, was a terrible choice for the main villain of any film. I mostly laughed at his scenes, because of how bad his acting was, when laughter was unintended. The guy who plays Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was not very good either in this film. Also Mark Ruffalo was a disappointment to see. I don't mind his acting normally but it was just so noticeably inferior to Edward Norton's Hulk that it has to count as a negative.To sum up, good pacing, special effects and some interesting encounters between certain characters do not save a film when it has weak direction, a weak script, a weak storyline, mostly weak acting, and most glaring of all it seemed very cold, calculated, and without style. However, I was at least mildly entertained.",

    "reviewTitle": "Whedon Anonymous",
    "reviewBody": "Joss Whedon's \"The Avengers\" opens with the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), Norse God of Mischief, on the planet Earth. Here he encounters Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of a superhero law enforcement agency. This introductory sequence is designed to show off both Loki's ruthlessness and the manly coolness of Nick Fury, but it achieves neither. It's an over-long sequence, filled with bad CGI and second-rate action.The film then offers a series of vignettes in which Fury assembles a group of superheroes, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Their task? Stop Loki and his giant CGI army. The problem? All these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together, organise and efficiently kick butt.Your typical Whedon tale centres on a Scooby Doo gangs of likable heroes (\"Serenity\", \"Firefly\", \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\", \"The Astonishing X-Men\" etc) and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good. Whedon's heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies, and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal. As he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal, Whedon also relies heavily on clever writing, witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement. With \"The Avengers\", however, he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster. The result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions, wanting to be huge, bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand, and wanting to be clever, small and intimate on the other. In the end, the vulgarity of money wins out over good prose.Still, a number of classic Whedon moments do survive. One cleverly written vignette has Black Widow tied to a chair, seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains. We then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is SHE who is interrogating THEM. Another clever moment sees Loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes' stronghold (yes, that cliché again), no one realising that Loki has designed his own capture, the God of Mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemy's own home. Most of the film's other good scenes revolve around the Hulk, who's imbued with much pathos by Mark Ruffalo, an actor renowned for his many melancholic-man roles; Ruffalo elevates everything he touches.The rest of \"The Avengers\" unfortunately degenerates into CGI fisticuffs, Michael Bay styled mayhem, exploding cities, CGI aliens, errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together. Here's a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us, when a guy like Whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope, chair or the sheer possibility that the Hulk might go schizoid. Like most Marvel projects, \"The Avengers\" mistakes excess for excitement.Whedon's never been a good visualist. Even his stint writing for the \"X-Men\" comics (\"The Astonishing X-Men\", a series arc which plays almost exactly like Whedon's \"The Avengers\" movie) relied more on words, banter, and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels. In this regard, most of \"The Avengers\" is slow and generically shot, though it does contain a few great visuals. A brief shot of a SWAT squad advancing on the Hulk's tiny shack is particularly cool. Beyond this, the film offers the usual super-hero subtext. Here the enemy hopes to invade America (New York) and obtain the Tesseract, a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on Earth thousands of years ago by Gods. Our heroes, of course, band together to stop the theft of the Tesseract. In a previous Marvel film, \"Captain America\", a Nazi figure called Red Skull also attempted to acquire this energy source. In Marvel lore, it's always our squeaky clean, white Western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep Earth's resources. Same as the real world, though the Pentagon rarely wears spandex when it's nuking for oil grids.Incidentally, Whedon's Loki is one of the most pathetic super-villains of all time. He's a whiny dude, with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher. You'd think The Avengers would assemble only for big fish, but no. They apparently take on wimpy Norse Gods as well.7.5/10 – See Josh Trank's \"Chronicle\".",

It's large enough that they feel like a team capable of defeating Loki and his army, but small enough that every member can be fleshed out and have their own character arc\n3) I thought it was actually quite brilliant how Nick Fury is able to manipulate the Avengers using Coulson's \"death\" and the Captain America playing cards. It makes the whole arc of the team splitting up and then coming back together feel completely believable\n4) The film does a really good job of bringing together all the Marvel films that came before us in a satisfying wayNEGATIVES:1) It really bothers me how Hawkeye and Selvig conveniently become cured from Loki's control just by hitting their heads. The convenience of Bruce Banner being \"always angry\" and able to become Hulk whenever he wants for the final battle is also bothering me\n2) How do they all communicate with each other when they aren't wearing ear pieces? It's so annoying\n3) When Captain America and Iron Man have to go and fix the SHIELD ship, Cap is easily able to fix some type of circuit board - how would he know how to do that when he comes from several decades ago??4) The humour is far too frequent in my opinion. It becomes really annoying. Iron Man especially; I know he's meant to be a funny character but he just became irritating - it was too much.",

Spiderman (1-3), Dark Knight, Super 8, Iron Man(1-2), Transformers(1-2)I really don't dislike that many movies. I'm not being cynical. This movie really is just a cluster ..... There's no emotion to the whole thing. Its dull and flat. It also feels very \"PG\"Its the definition of cliché when it comes to super hero movies. There's no bar being raised, there is nothing new being done. The entire script is just a bunch of predictable non sense jargon with no meaning. There's no event in the movie where i go wow, that is original. Or go wow this movie gives me emotion and it really immerses me in the experience(Watch the beginning of star trek).My only thoughts is that Walt Disney Pictures did black hat tactics to hype this movie through social networks. I cannot and will not believe people think this movie is worth an 8.8.I really did want to walk out of the theater. This movie is forgettable and I was very disappointed and let down. This movie really just feels like another \"average\" super hero movie. But the expectation of it being good just makes it worse.",

    "reviewTitle": "Essentially 'Transformers:Dark of the Moon' if it were made competently...",
    "reviewBody": "'The Avengers' is a brilliant cartoon with tremendous flair, style, and more than it's share of silliness. Director Joss Whedon is allowed free reign to present a massive spectacle of action and destruction and it is often very visually spectacular and often more than fun. Is 'The Avengers' the comic book masterpiece awaited for years by geeks everywhere? No. It isn't even Marvel's best offering as an independent studio. The only level 'The Avengers' really succeeds on is being a huge cartoon. It offers nothing truly unique in realm of dealing with these characters or their mythology. If the modern day comic book is a romanticized colorful dissection of hero worship and good and evil as I and a great many comic book fans like to think it is than Joss Whedon has ultimately failed in respecting that and using it to give his audiences something to chew on. In a great many ways I found myself brought back to the horrendous experience last summer of watching another huge action spectacle, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. 'The Avengers' is in many ways the same movie, neither have any sense of stakes other than to make sequels. Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor are here to sell toys and tickets.Epicness is what is on the table in this film and Joss Whedon surely does deliver an epic action packed film. Delivering an action packed film isn't all that hard to do though. There are no stakes to 'The Avengers'. Missing is a sense of dread and threat. I wanted our heroes to really be tested by something bigger than themselves and they aren't. I sing the praises of Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and you know what Jon Favreau's first 'Iron Man' film because they truly brought our characters to a point where they had to question what made them heroes and if being a hero was more than just paraphernalia. Both films created tremendously strong villains which served as representations of all that could be corrupted and made evil within the title heroes. The threat in 'The Avengers' comes in the form of a pretty lame mcguffin. We find out next to nothing about the tesseract cube other than it can blow stuff up in a Michael Bay-esque fashion. The threat to our heroes is pretty dull and lackluster. Often our heroes have to spend time reminding us they are saving the world because we forget. I wanted to be reminded that our heroes bleed and can die. Kill off a sacrificial lamb and keep me interested. (I know the retort here about Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson and he is a very fun character but he merely serves as a second rate sidekick)I think every actor in here is having a blast in their roles and I love seeing it. I don't necessarily think they are all taking their roles seriously but I do think they are engaging all the great things that make these characters pulp icons. My favorite performance has to be Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Loki isn't all that rounded a villain or character but Hiddleston loves the comic book nature of the character. Saying you want to take over the world often is a silly empty threat and yet if someone says it the right way it is fun.The final battle scene is grand as promised. Is it fun? Yes. That is something I do want to reiterate because the film is fun. There is something to be said about enjoying eye candy and things blowing up. 'The Avengers' is a masterpiece if that is what we are concerned with. Does the battle go on too long? I didn't check my watch nearly as much as I did during 'Dark of the Moon' but yes it is drawn out. I think I wouldn't feel this way though had the problems mentioned earlier been addressed. The chitauri are just plot pieces and even though we see our heroes take some hits never do we see any real toil this has on them. What is 'The Avengers'? A cartoon. The kid in me was satisfied with all the action but the adult in me wanted more.I think with 'The Avengers' we have a cinematic Rorschach with everyone getting something they want out of it and rating it much higher than it truly deserves. I saw it opening weekend and have pondered over it amidst the fanfare. Is it a good film? Yes, if you hold it up as a summer blockbuster it is an exceptional fun filled ride. Is it a substantive film? No, if you want a substantive comic book film than see 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man'.",

    "reviewBody": "\"The Avengers\" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time.",

    "reviewBody": "Ugh! \"Avengers\" wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their \"advance warfare\" includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn't boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of \"THOR\". PLUS, PLUS, he didn't even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don't think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of \"The Incredible Hulk\", it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in \"The Avengers\" that he wouldn't even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap's love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see \"Jenny Agutter\" listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn't stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates.... No real philosophic underpinnings like X-Men had... It was kind of just DisneyWorld on Crack, but it was fun to see on opening night....",

    "reviewBody": "My friend took me to see the most hyped movie of the year and I have to say as a fan of superhero movies this is the best one by far.The film is about Nick Fury played by Samuel L Jackson who wants to assemble an army of \"Avengers\" Consisting of Iron Man played by Robert Downy Jr, The Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson, Captain America played by Chris Evans, Thor played by Chris Hemsworth and Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who have to take out Loki Thor's Brother played by Tom Hiddleston from destroying the world with a device known as The Tesseract.This was such a great movie. The action was fantastic, has great special effects, Really funny moments like the guy playing Galaga on the job(if you have seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about), a fantastic Third act which some of the movie was shot in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, There is a Cameo by Stan Lee at the end of the movie. and the only superhero movie I know that has a reference to Marijuana in it. The only complaint was that it felt like a 3 1/2 hour movie, but since the movie was that good I can let it slip. If you do not see this in Theaters than you have no personality.Rated PG-13 For Intense Sequences Of Sci-Fi Violence And Action Throughout, And A Mild Drug Reference.2hrs 22min/142min.****/****",

    "reviewTitle": "Beyond brilliant and beyond awesome, this perfectly plotted and skilfully assembled blend of wit, humour and jaw-dropping action is undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever",
    "reviewBody": "A colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of 'Marvel's The Avengers', the culmination of five incredibly successful standalone films over the last four years. Not only has helmer Joss Whedon not cracked under the immense hype, he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that have come before it, combining jaw-dropping action, tongue-in-cheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of summer blockbuster entertainment. Proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts, Wheedon has distilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of Marvel superheroes- Iron Man is wiry and snarky as ever; Thor is just as Godly in his might but Human-ly in his compassion; and Captain America is still appealingly old-school. The Hulk, or Bruce Banner in his human form, is quite something else altogether though (being the only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films) and very much all the better for it- but we'll save our gushing for later.It shouldn't come as any surprise that the one movie which 'Avengers' is most intimately associated with is 'Thor', given that both share the same villain- Thor's adopted brother and fellow Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston)- and that Wheedon did shoot the post-credits scene with Loki and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Opening with a recurring character from that movie, Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is now assisting with experiments on the Tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its own.Turns out that the fallen Loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of Earth, using the same Tessaract as a portal to cross over from their universe to ours- and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, but also the takeover of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Selvig to do his bidding. With the fate of the world in the balance, Fury activates his 'Avengers' initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others- Black Widow and Hawkeye. Even from the outset, it's clear that there is organic spontaneity in Wheedon's storytelling, as he fluently weaves together the recruiting exercise by Fury and his trusted agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the participating superheroes. The best he saves for last, so even though Thor only first appears half an hour into the movie, his is a spectacular entrance befitting of that for a God, crossing paths with Iron Man for a thunderous one-on-one clash in the middle of the woods.True to the spirit of the books, the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note- chiefly due to Stark's distrust of Fury and disdain for the star-and-stripes-outfitted Captain America. Instead, Stark teams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal- Bruce Banner- to locate the Tessaract and uncover what dirty secrets Fury has been keeping from the rest of them. The answer to the latter isn't all too unexpected, but kudos to Wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in 'Thor'. It will take something colossal to jolt them out of their self- centredness- and believe us when we say that game-changer is certainly massive, counting for the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly thrilling stuff you'll see on the big screen this year. And just when you think it couldn't get any better, Wheedon tops it with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of New York City.The reason why the finale works so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome- Wheedon loves and respects each and every superhero character just as much. Wheedon gets the action pitch-perfect through reinforcing the individual powers of each one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition. It is nothing less than pure ecstasy when they join forces as a team, and you'll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and cheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finish.This review however won't be complete without a special shout-out for the Hulk, many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the Lee Ang and the later Louis Leterrier iteration of it. Here, Wheedon has finally gotten it right, blending both the character's brains and brawn to crowdpleasing effect- even more so through some clever plotting that ensures Banner's eventual transformation from man to beast is as rewarding as it should be. Indeed, there's really no reason why you shouldn't be running out and catching this the first instance it opens. Calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just how brilliant it is, and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far. Filled with wit, humour and incredible action, it ranks as one of the most- if not the most- entertaining and exhilarating experiences you'll have at the movies this year.",

    "reviewTitle": "Awesome and Amazing Avengers Assembled",
    "reviewBody": "After years and years of anticipation, we finally get to see some of our favorite superheroes meet and fight together as a team. Creating a movie like this is difficult, considering that it would be hard to combine the different superheroes' story lines and merge them into one storyline. However, Marvel pulled that off easily by strategically releasing movies over the past four years about each of the heroes to serve as prologues and create anticipation for this amazing, awesome, action-packed \"The Avengers\".In the first 45 minutes, we see what has happened to our favorite Marvel superheroes in their own respective lives. Iron Man is forced back into action when he was in the middle of a date with Pepper Potts. The star-spangled soldier Captain America has woken up from his 70-year-old frozen sleep and has a lot to explore in his new surroundings. The new fresh revamped Bruce Banner has been helping sick kids in India. Black Widow is taking a day off by taking another mission when a call from Agent Coulson requires her to return to normal business with Nick Fury. Thor comes a bit later on and we meet newcomer master archer Hawkeye.So what's the danger this time? It's none other than Loki from \"Thor\". To answer some of your questions, No, he didn't die (the post-credits scene from \"Thor\"). So even if he didn't die, how did he arrive on Earth when the bridge connecting the different universes has been destroyed? Apparently, Loki was saved by another alien race called the Chitauri. He offers a deal with the Chitauri leader; he will command the Chitauri army in an attempt to subjugate Earth in exchange for the Tesseract. So Loki arrives through the Tesseract (which has the ability to build portals) on Earth and starts to execute his plan.While Loki was doing fine in the early stages of his schemes, the heroes didn't get along so well in the beginning. As reality would suggest, the members of the team get into some fights (there's one action-packed scene where Iron Man fights against Thor with Captain America caught in between). There's a lot of dispute between the superheroes, much to Loki's favor, all due to either rivalry, jealousy, suspiciousness, or many other reasons. This gives the heroes more humanity and possibly some vulnerability which really make the movie more realistic. This is just one of the highlights of Joss Whedon's flawless script.Joss Whedon also successfully blended the different universes of the different superheroes and made it into one film. This is rather difficult considering the natures of the superheroes. World War II to Captain America seems like yesterday and he still has a lot to catch up with (he doesn't know who Stephen Hawking is). Thor, who is of mythological nature, is still used to Asgardian lifestyle. Joss Whedon successfully pulled this off and so the interaction between the different superheroes seem sensible, not awkward. The dialog is perfect and natural.Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the action. By giving the characters the sense of vulnerability, the fight scenes seem more risky and more heart-pumping. While it may be heart-racing, the action scenes are also fun to watch, especially when we see the Incredible Hulk in action. The Hulk is just a mindless monster (although he suddenly becomes aware of himself towards the climax) who wrecks havoc at anything that he considers a potential threat. His role in destroying the enemies during the climax was very entertaining. That said, the climax and finale of the film was one of the best and one of the most thrilling I've ever seen. It offers brilliant visual effects and conjures up enough awe to satisfy anyone seeking intense sequences of action. By the end of it, you'll be satisfied but will still be eager for more.The performances were very convincing. Robert Downey Jr. played the role of the quirky Tony Stark to perfection. His dialog, his performance, everything about him was just perfect. Chris Evans also had a strong performance playing the role of Captain America. He was able to exploit the Captain's inner feelings. Chris Hemsworth also did justice with Thor, Samuel L. Jackson did a commanding job as Nick Fury, Jeremy Renner played a determined Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson played a sexy and deadly Black Widow, Tom Hiddleston portrayed a malicious and manipulating Loki. However the main star of the show was Mark Ruffalo as the incredible Hulk. He was able to portray a calm, tranquil Bruce Banner but also showed signs that Bruce Banner can, at any time, become the Hulk.The humor is heart-warming and very well. Every now and then, there's always a little bit of humor to cheer up the audience. While one might expect that most of the humor would come from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr., actually the humor is divided equally among the characters including Loki. Why I love this is because every character has a chance to shine and steal the scene.\"The Avengers\" is a must-see and a great movie to start the summer movie season. It's got the interesting premise, the operatic action scenes, the great jokes and many more to offer. This is absolutely one of the best, if not, the best superhero film of all time. It offers a great deal of fun for a broad range of viewers. Just get up from the couch, head to the nearest movie theater and watch \"The Avengers\". It's great and 3D is a viable option. Oh, and once the credits roll, don't leave yet. There's two post-credits scenes you don't want to miss, and one of them involves the Chitauri leader.Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: \"The Avengers\" is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films of all time and is guaranteed to blow audiences away with plenty of action sequences, outstanding visual effects, a powerful script, and solid performances.",

The fact is this film is over-hyped and doesn't live up to what it claims to be nor does it complement the critics' excitement, which is to rave the first action movie of the summer - like a ritual and to be quoted in the ads. While watching I asked myself how many times have I seen done to death special effects like a gaping hole in the sky? The aliens raining and attacking New York? Technical jargon supplemented by devices and gizmos? Some huge contraption passing for a space station floating in the sky? And so much executed and projected before that I felt fatigued! The 3D effects are absent where they should have been in your face and more - like when the black widow holds the gun at a character and the nozzle is out of the frame! The cohesive factor, and which keeps it going is the (tongue in cheek) wit, which everyone is blessed with! So much so such dialogues appear to be out of a MAD satire! And to think of it when Thor knew Loki so well or his psyche, then why send for the other five?",

How anyone can rate this movie amongst the pantheon of great titles is beyond me.So trying to find something constructive to say about this title is hard...I enjoyed Iron Man? Tony Stark is an inspirational character in his own movies but here he is a pale shadow of that...About the only 'hook' this movie had into me was wondering when and if Iron Man would knock Captain America out...Oh how I wished he had :( What were these other characters anyways? Useless, bickering idiots who really couldn't organise happy times in a brewery. The film was a chaotic mish mash of action elements and failed 'set pieces'...I found the villain to be quite amusing.And now I give up. This movie is not robbing any more of my time but I felt I ought to contribute to restoring the obvious fake rating and reviews this movie has been getting on IMDb.",

    "reviewBody": "I'll preface... I'm not a comic book reader. I enjoy fantasy, as long as it makes sense in its own self-created universe (Star Wars and Trek, Harry Potter, Superman). But the Avengers is awful, and even worse considering how highly rated this junk is on IMDb. It has a couple moments of delight (but so did the Phantom Menace), and the effects are state of the art, bar none. But, this is the 50th movie in a row where the photorealistic effects impressed me. Now, I'm afraid I need a real movie to use that CGI to good effect.The Avengers fails for me due to the character combination. I didn't read a single comic book, but Universal released this huge budget movie knowing they will need to attract 10 new people for everyone who read the dusty old comic books. The Avengers are a dumb assembly of heroes. Captain America is an idiot character. He is from a different time, isn't good at anything modern (like why is he barking orders?), and has no powers whatsoever. Ditto for Black Widow and Hawkeye. I mean, the latter shoots friggin arrows. Cappy had a shield and punches guys within 5 feet of him. They are just plain lame. Thor is a GOD and the Hulk is invincible. They're immortal. Unstoppable. And Iron Man, with his impossible-to-believe suit which might as well be magic-based is also nearly invincible. Who needs the other 3? Why isn't Spiderman in this group? Or some of the X-Men? As for the humans, why do we have a city-sized aircraft carrier? That flies and looks amazingly like the big aircraft from Avatar? Why build a ship that flies? Okay, now the plot. I don't get it. This movie is 2:22 minutes. I don't even understand Loki's motivation or plan. Loki wants to blow up Earth? Why? Why do those Aliens/Clash of the Titans monsters want to blow up Earth? Why could Thor and Loki get to Earth but they can't without the magic portal? Are those monsters magical or technological? And that cube - seriously, they used the same lame McGuffin from Transformers. Which is a movie very much like this one. I mean that as an insult. What was Loki's plan, crumble the outer shells of buildings in NYC. Shoot a lot and not hit anyone? Not one human even seemed to get hit with all the devastation.I hated it. My wife and kids hated it. My 9 year old son hated it. That says it all. It made no sense, was utterly talky and boring for a huge chunk of it. The Dark Knight wipes its rear end with this blu-ray disc. Avoid at all costs unless you liked Transformers 3, John Carter and Clash of the Titans.",

    "reviewBody": "At first when I heard of this show, I was kinda excited about it. But when I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it, I was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show. It's not the characters or actors that is horrible, it's the director to be honest. I don't know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it, but the lines and conversation were so fake, blunt and seriously horrible. It lakes emotions, feelings or even creativeness. Let alone, the whole plot is too predictable and boring. No doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome, but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012. I rather watch \"The Dark Knight\" anytime rather than this horrible show. Even friends of mine who are crazy about DC and Marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show. In fact, they leave the theatres during halfway of the show. This is just an example to show how horrible it is. All in short, this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time.",

I am yet to find a person who didn't like this movie, and I can fully understand why. I honestly TRIED to find something about it to even nitpick at, and found nothing. This is the ultimate comic book movie; I highly recommend this to any lover of action, superhero or sci-fi movies, as well as to any avid comic book readers.

    "reviewBody": "What happens when you get a team of super hero's together who shouldn't be in a room together let alone trying to save a city? You have the Avengers, one of the most anticipated movies for years. I remember working at a movie theater back in 2007 and one of the guys that worked there was telling me about how there was talks to make the film and I thought it was never going to happen, well, clearly this is why I'm not in the stock market. But when I heard that Joss Whedon was behind it, I couldn't wait, he's the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is one of Hollywood's best writers. He has a genuine love for comics, action and giving characters real depth. After viewing The Avengers, you couldn't ask for better action on the big screen and so much great excitement. I think the fans got everything they were asking for and deserved with this great popcorn flick.Nick Fury arrives at a remote research facility during an evacuation. The commander explains that an energy source of unknown potential has activated and opened a mysterious portal. Through it steps the exiled Loki, who takes the Tesseract and uses his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel including agent Clint Barton and a few others in order to aid in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the Avengers Initiative: Agent Natasha Romanoff, Dr. Bruce Banner, Agent Phil Coulson, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract from Loki. However, Thor, Loki's adoptive brother, arrives and attempts to free Loki to reason with him. When that doesn't work, the hero's start fighting over who's in charge until they realize that Loki's ego is growing stronger and will destroy the world if they do not stick together and stop him as The Avengers.First off, the actors: Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson all clicked so amazingly well together. I'm still a little bummed that they couldn't get Edward Norton for the Hulk, he was a perfect cast and just excellent in The Incredible Hulk, but Mark gives his own take to the character and comes through in the end. The effects are so amazing and grand to watch on the big screen that this was the only way you should see the movie as they are just tearing New York apart with all these aliens and flying creatures in the middle of down town Manhatten. Now one of the things I do have to laugh a little at is that all the characters get these cool costumes, sleek, sexy and toughthen you have Captain America who looks like he got his costume at Target. You can't blame the officer he tells to get the police to get the civilians to safety and the officer asks \"and who are you that I should be taking these orders from?\". There are some great comedic moments, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. and The Hulk just going crazy on Loki.There are a couple of flaws in the film like Loki. I don't know if it was the actor, Tom Hiddleston, but I just couldn't really take him seriously as a villain. I found the aliens who were invading more threatening as Loki just keeps saying \"Kneel before me! I am a God!\" and giving you a used car salesman's smile. There are moments where it seems to drag a little with the talking, as we're getting our hero's together. I'm all for development, but I wanted a WWE smack down because we're not given as much depth with these characters as you would say Spider-man or Batman. But I think I'm just nitpicking at this point because I don't want to put anyone off on the film.The Avengers is everything you could ask for in a superhero film. It's got great action, excellent chemistry, good style and is just a ton of fun to watch. I got to see this in a crowded theater where you can tell the audience was just pumped up to see something good and you got to give the film credit for bringing some excitement to the theater. We don't get many exciting films that have actual good writing to it like this. Joss did an excellent job handling these big guys on the screen and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Though I hope there is more egging on of the Hulk, I would have a ton of fun if I were next to him saying what Captain America was talking about his mama.8/10",

    "reviewBody": "Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.I feel all of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was underused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I was never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the film's funny lines coming from him.Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I think he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared previously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.Hawkeye was really well played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I don't know why. But regardless he is a great character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark replied \"Ok hang on then Legolas\". Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.The humour of the film mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There were deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruce's alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as well, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).One small annoyance I had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful being ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them). It's just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thor's Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it doesn't even leave a scratch on Captain America's shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.I also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, they're always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battle.But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it.",

    "reviewTitle": "A success yes, but not really on a groundbreaking level",
    "reviewBody": "Here we have \"The Avengers\", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that's also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the \"other end of the universe\" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but it's still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.",

    "reviewTitle": "It has everything that you can possibly hope for",
    "reviewBody": "When I first read about the film I thought it would not be that good to watch a juice of so many characters. But the director was rightfully applauded for his work in giving a good deal of time to all the characters. Everything about the movie is very nice. It takes you through all the characters about whom you would have probably learned a lot and for those who do not know a lot, Marvel has already done everything for them to understand with a series of films based on the individual character. That is a thing that truly marks American films different from others. They know what audience will want and how to serve them. You will find a lot of instances (as I had experienced) when you would just be scared that such a nice film has to come to an end after 2 hours 20 minutes.PROS : I loved the timings of each and every characters except for hulk who was introduced in a simple manner but who ultimately steals the show based on his (my favorite) two dialogs which I have heard from everyone that they liked. The instance when hulk comes into action , everyone have to shout like hell. Iam a big fan of iron man and especially because of Robert Downey but this green character fills up the whole space every time he becomes angry or rather say wants to be angry. What I first thought before entering into this mind blowing film , I had been thinking that Thor would be playing a greater role and since he is some god typo so he will help the avengers the most. But I like to get wrong evreytime I start a film. Than comes our nick fury who though was the leader of the group in papers but appeared to be playing a role of the grand daddy. I felt this especially in the 2nd half. But that was nicely handled as he was doing whatever he could do , and what was best for him. Black Widow and I mean everyone was playing a role that they could play according to their abilities. However a single disappointment was the role of captain America who did not seem to fit properly into the fight sequences. And he was looking a kind of supporting role along side the hawk eye and the black widow.CONS – I would have liked to see some more development into the story of the tysserect and how loki got involved with everything. Everyone seemed to be in a little bit of hurry in the second half. Well may be I am too attached to the film that's why I am saying that. \"A must watch for anyone.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "It's Iron Man's world and the rest of the Avengers just live in it, apparently...",
    "reviewBody": "As one of the seemingly few who's not a fan of the Iron Man character or his films, and after seeing the trailers, I had my reservations about this film. Was it going to be Iron Man 3, guest-starring the rest? Well, yes and no. It's clear who Joss Whedon's favourites are, as they get the most character development. Those who come out on top: Tony Stark (of course), Black Widow and (surprisingly) Bruce Banner/Hulk. If you're a fan of these characters/the actors who portray them, then you should be satisfied with their amount of screen time.Fans of Stark, who don't mind his attitude and want nothing more than his mumbled speedy snarky lines/blowing stuff up will be the most pleased. Annoyingly, even his love interest gets to be the only one to appear in this film (too bad for Peggy Carter & Jane Foster, both of whom I greatly prefer as characters. Though at least we get to see a *picture* of them and it's mentioned that Jane's safe. I wish Thor had been allowed to reunite with her before he left again). RDJ does his thing, and he's naturally fine doing it, but I'm probably in the minority who prefers him as Sherlock in his Sherlock Holmes films.Captain America thankfully gets to retain his likability, calls Tony out on his BS (there's more than one scene of two verbally sparring) and has his moments of leadership. I was annoyed, however, that his practical costume from CA: TFA was replaced with one that looked like the comical outfit he wore when promoting war bonds during the 'Star Spangled Man' song/dance number in his solo film. It's pretty clear Whedon views him as a 'dork' of sorts, so he's reduced to the butt of jokes and not getting to be 'cool' like Stark. Even with Whedon's clear bias against him, Steve continues to be the most likeable/noble hero.Scarlett Johansson gets to kick sufficient ar$e as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and does a good job of subverting the obvious (something Whedon is a fan of...along with scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other). There are a few moments where it appears she's beaten/showing signs of weakness, but then she turns things on their head and she proves herself to be no damsel and more than capable/not to be underestimated. The one somewhat 'regressive' role Whedon sticks her in is 'beauty taming the beast' in regards to her character and the Hulk.Speaking of the 'other guy'(as Bruce calls him), this Hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions thanks to motion-capture allowing Mark Ruffalo to actually portray the not-so-jolly green giant and even his face bears resemblance to Ruffalo. Bruce gets to be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie, but when he eventually Hulks out, he does plenty smash-o-crash. Unfortunately, Hulk is also played for some rather immature laughs at times, like when he punches Thor after they've just teamed up to take down a baddie (why? Because it's \"FUNNY\"!) or he cuts Loki off mid-speechifying by tossing him around like a ragdoll, thus kinda undoing all the effort Tom Hiddleston put into making Loki menacing (there's one exchange he has with Natasha where he comes across truly evil). It's clear Whedon's not a fan of 'god-like' characters and hopes to sway others to be like-minded.Nick Fury gets to be sneaky/manipulative, jumps on the 'Let's blame Thor' train and shoots stuff, as does his offside, Agent Hill (Cobie Smulders), when she's not providing exposition or miraculously escaping death. Hawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends the majority of the film zombiefied by Loki, but is eventually freed of the mind-control and his backstory with Natasha is briefly touched upon. Even Agent Coulson gets a fair amount of development. Disappointingly, Thor gets the short end of the stick...or hammer. I'd thoroughly enjoyed his solo movie and Chris Hemsworth in the role, so I was hoping he'd get the respect/focus he deserved as part of this ensemble cast...but it seemed Tony Stark's one-liners and the Hulk beating Asgardian ar$e for laughs was Whedon's priority, sadly.Poor Thor never seems to be allowed to have a true victory in the film, which is a real disappointment since his character had undergone a true hero's journey in his own film and deserved to be taken seriously, rather than disrespected/treated as the butt of jokes. Sure, he and 'Mew Mew' get to kick a fair amount of butt, but not nearly enough as they *should've*. He doesn't even get to be the one who takes down Loki (his brother...who's adopted) in the end and save everyone, as that victory's given Iron Man and Hulk, of course (and Thor had been about to save Stark's ar$e at the end too until Hulk swooped in and stole his thunder). Such a shame that Thor gets screwed over, but I appreciated his little moments of humour (all the more effective because they *aren't* OTT or at the expense of others) and that he brought some actual seriousness to proceedings/his complicated sibling relationship with Loki wasn't entirely ignored.Despite my few quibbles, the film surprisingly comes together pretty well. Whedon proves he can direct action with the best of them and it's blissfully free of overuse of shaky-cam. It's quite the feat, bringing all these characters from different films together and actually making it *work*, but he pulls it off. Not a dollar of the movie's considerable budget has been wasted. It's all up there on the screen, the humour works (some of the time), all the actors do well in their roles, but I personally would've liked to have spent more time with Cap & Thor and exploring their reluctant partnership (how about a buddy film?). I'm more invested in their own solo films than seeing them sharing time with characters who I'm not a fan of, but not opposed to seeing the Avengers reassemble.",

    "reviewTitle": "The long-awaited party (not Bilbo's one-hundred eleventh birthday)",
    "reviewBody": "Like Bilbo's one-hundred-eleventh birthday party, \"The Avengers\" is a \"long-awaited\" event, after four (not counting Hulk) major features on the ensemble of heroes which grossed a mind-boggling aggregate box office in excess of 2 billion dollars (well over half of which coming from the two editions of Iron Man). The main plot is rather simple, and familiar: (a) Earth is fighting for its very survival against alien invasions and (b) there is an object/device of immense power sought by one and all, good guys as well as bad guys. Assembling the ensemble of six is quite a challenge. Before we examine how cleverly this is done, let's try to catalogue the protagonists. How about into 3 groups? Least \"human\" are Thor and Hulk. Early in the movie, just before his first appearance, a cryptic remark is made about Thor to the effect of something like he is \"basically a god\". Hulk remains human, but only until \"the other guy\" (a term used repeatedly by our hero himself) takes over. Next come the \"Six Million Dollar Man\" category: human with so much done to their body that they become sort of superhuman: Iron Man and Captain America. Finally, there are Black Widow and Hawkeye (altered ego of \"Green Arrow\" of the other camp, the JLA?), Nick Fury's special agents who are one hundred percent human but trained to so excel in combat that they are almost superhuman. The villains are quite unimpressive, serving as punch bags for our heroes, who provide vastly better entertainment by fighting among themselves. Let's see how cleverly this achieved by a plot that is nowhere near being convoluted and yet delightfully un-formulaic.While everything evolves around Nick Fury whose brainchild \"The Avengers\" is, assembling of the team is mesmerizing, providing plenty of opportunities for fights among the heroes. Almost from the first minute, Hawkeye defects to villain Loki who wields a brain-control device. Black Widow succeeds in persuading Hulk to join, but only as a research scientist, not a superhero (they consider \"the other guy\" more a monster than a hero). Captain America, technically over 100 years old, is revived from his deep freeze while Iron Man is led into Fury's scheme much earlier on (off screen), almost like his partner. Soon after Iron Man, with Captain America's assistance, subdues Loki (part of the villain's cunning plot) Thor who seems to have materialized out of nowhere claims his brother for a prisoner, setting off an exciting bout with Iron Man, eventually stopped by Captain America's mediation. At Fury's headquarter (an invisible flying aircraft carries – this you will have to see for yourself), five of the six Avengers assemble, with Loki in captivity. The villain's plot is to have the defected sixth (Hawkeye) come to his rescue and destroy his captors. He tries, very close to succeeding, to manipulate the team member's different personalities to set them against each other. Even more damaging, Loki thinks, is a provocation to bring out \"the other guy\", unleashing Hulk's destructive power. It seems to work initially. The attack led by defected Hawkeye provokes the appearance of green monster Hulk. The ensuing combat between the physically two most powerful (Hulk and Thor) is something to behold. While this one is sheer brutal force, the fight between the two special agents is a show of beautiful yet lethal combat techniques. The result: Hawkeye breaks out of the brain control to which he has been subjected and comes back to his senses. As well, Captain American and Iron Man, whose personality conflict has been the biggest obstacle to their cooperation, finally work together as a team.So in the last hour of the movie, while Loki brings out his alien army down on to Manhattan, The Avengers are finally cemented as a team, as you see in the most publicized trailer shot with the camera circling them in an undaunted spirit of solidarity, ready to face whatever enemy that dares to come to Earth. This movie must be seen at least twice. The first time you are dividing your attention between following the story and watching the action. Only in the second time can you fully enjoy the excellent dialogue (rare for an action movie) which will be several times more meaningful than this first. At the same time, you are able to sit back and fully enjoy the action. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth reprise their respective characters, adding a delightful new dimension on personality conflicts. All this is done mostly through crispy, witty dialogue. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, who has made brief and briefer appearances respectively in Iron Man and Thor franchises, bring more complete realization to their respective character, as well as a half-told story of their past relationship which strongly suggests a spin-off prequel. Last but certainly not least is Mark Ruffalo whose soft-spoken, low-key interpretation of Hulk gets two thumbs up from me.And of course there are all the others. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson and Tom Hiddleston's Loki need no introduction, and not even reminders. From Iron Man comes Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and from Thor comes Stellan Skarsgard's Erik Selvig, two more familiar faces. For a welcomed new face is Cobie Smulder's Agent Maria Hill.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nuff Said!",
    "reviewBody": "As I missed this in the Theatre, I waited a long time for the Blu-Ray to come out. I knew back in 2008 when Iron Man came out, that The Avengers were Assembling.I did not understand why Marvel made a second \"Hulk\" film after Ang lee's marvel-ous work, but that Hulk was a stand-alone story, and not worked into the fabric of the Marvel Multiverse.Each solo Avengers film introduced characters which were to be in this film, Iron Man was the most developed of them all, The Hulk, Captain America and Thor each developed those characters for this film.There was one more Avenger that should have been included, Wolverine, but at the time Marvel did not have the rights. Even so, Wolverine was not part of that first Avengers comic so long ago where they Battle Loki, and that is what this film was about.Joss Whedon was the prefect director to tackle this: His work on his Television shows and the Movie \"Serenity\" prepared him for it. I was glad that an Underdog was given the Helm, and he succeeded brilliantly.After being Bombarded by the first Three X-Men films and the Sam Raimi Spidey Trilogy, it was just time to make this film. The Avengers are that one Marvel Property that has threads into all of Marvel's Super Heroes.The pivotal piece was Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury - I grew up when Nick Fury was a white guy and he was a much different character. Sometime in the late 90's and early 2000's Marvel recreated all of their Heroes and gave some of them a complete Makeover: But Jackson plays Fury much the same way David Hasselhoff did in the TV Movie. It does not matter what colour he is, white or black, he's the same guy.It is this one man who spearheads \"The Avengers Initiative\" - Even though his board of supervisors have put the program \"on ice\" Fury finds a way to make it happen, he puts together a \"response team\" to deal with the threat of Loki.We met Loki in \"Thor\" - Originally he was Thor's \"Brother\" and best friend. In \"Thor\" Loki learns he is actually a Frost Giant (Which is actually part of the Norse Legend) and something snaps in him. The Loki in The Avengers is not the subdued, Quiet Loki we meet in the first few scenes of Thor, he has completely lost it.This Mirrors the way he was written for the Comic Books, the way I see it, Loki does not really know what he wants, so he is just trying as many bad things as he can think up. In the case of this film, he has made a shaky alliance with some creepo Aliens (We learn exactly who these guys are, at the very end of the film, after the title credits), as \"The Other\" is talking to his boss, who turns in Profile and he is a SKRULL).The Tesseract, the \"Cosmic Cube\" which has been a huge part of Marvel stories, was seen in Captain America, Red Skull was abusing it, it fell into the arctic ice and Howard Stark grabbed it. After the events of the Movie Thor, Fury assigns Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to figure out what the futz this thing actually is.And they find out, as \"Hawkeye\" (Jeremy Renner) states at the beginning of the film, The Cube is a doorway, and it is being opened from the other side.In steps Loki and he has gone even more insane, comparing the Human Race to bugs to be squashed via a Boot. Loki manages to turn Hawkeye and Selvig (This is another thing about Loki which came from the Comics), and the entire complex where The Cube was being tested caves in, huge Radar antenna and all.From this point on, it's Non Stop. We get to see SO much stuff from the Comics, the SHIELD HeliCarrier, the Avengers Mansion (Which was Stark Tower). But the best thing was the interaction of these guys, they don't get along in the Comics, and they don't get along very well at first here. What surprised me was how well Mark Ruffalo made The Hulk come to life, even though I liked Ang Lee's Hulk better: But Rufallo actually \"Acted\" The Hulk, which was something not done in the two Hulk Movies.From this point on, Avengers sets a Bar for Marvel Movies that will be difficult to reach again, let alone surpass.This film easily surpasses the quality of the first two X-Men films, without burying them.",

The viewers then experience the same seen it and done it before special effects. What make \"The Avengers\" stand out from other comic book movies is the character development. The Stark, and Hulk characters save \"The avengers\"! Stark and Hulk create comic relief and interesting dialogue. When the Stark and Hulk disagree with the other super heroes their wit is hilarious.

    "reviewTitle": "MARVELous",
    "reviewBody": "\"The tesseract has awakened.\" spoken in the opening scene, picks right up where 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Thor' left off. S.H.E.I.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is forced to call upon earths mightiest hero's to stop the self outcast Asgardian Loki.Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, along with Black Widow and Hawkeye, are the only hope to save the world from an invasion, and boy do they in an instant superhero classic. Possibly the best thing about The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble in the UK) is that each hero has grounded powers the exception being Thor (unless you count Hulk's strength as a super power), which makes the Marvel hero's more believable than their DC. counterparts.There's drama, action, comedy, and some amazing CGI, and thankfully doesn't fall into the same category as the not so fantastic Fantastic 4 movies. Mark Ruffalo, replacing the underwhelming Ed Norton, excels as Bruce Banner/Hulk, which is without a doubt the best on screen version of the iconic hero after the awful 2003 'Hulk' movie and 2008's slightly improved 'The Incredible Hulk', as well as Ruffalo and co star Robert Downey Jr. Playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for the 4th time, having some fantastic chemistry in a scene on-board the Hellcarrier.Chris Evans plays Captain America perfectly as the man out of time, Chris Hemsworth is believable in his role as Loki's Brother (like in Thor) Scarlett Johansson is the surprise of the movie though with a lot of the action revolving around her Black Widow, the only major disappointment with The Avengers is that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is underused. That being said every hero gets decent screen time to justify their appearance as well as everyone having a big part to play in the fantastic final sequence.However, The Avengers towers over every superhero movie in recent memory with the only real challengers being X-Men and The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joss Whedons hit is sure to please Marvel fans and the everyday movie goer. Next up for Marvel studios, Iron Man 3, cant wait.Best quote in the movie: Loki:\"How desperate are you that you call upon such such lost creatures to defend you?\"If you enjoyed watching: X-Men, Fantastic 4, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, you'll enjoy watching The Avengers (Avengers Assemble).",

    "reviewBody": "My inner child is something I value most, and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my Iron Man and Captain America toys, as well as wishing I was the Incredible Hulk. I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies. Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks \"Is this what you want?\". Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. \"We need a plan of attack!\" \"I have a plan. Attack.\" and \"WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?\" \"I don't like what comes after.\"The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when  possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt. The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making this movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again. Now I've only got two more words to say: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!",

    "reviewBody": "The good: Robert Downey Jr. is charming as ever. Scarlett Johannsen is delicious as ever. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America. Mark Ruffalo turned in a good performance as David Banner. Samuel Jackson is usual Bad-ass self. Did I leave anyone out? The CGI is up to today's usual high standard. Oh I nearly forgot: The Thor guy was pretty cool too, though why does a Scandinavian God speak with a British Accent?The bad: There's no plot. Loki is a 1-dimensional villain. He \"wants to be king.\" He wants people to submit. That's it. That's all there is.I expected more from Joss Whedon, like the incredible reboot J. J. Abrams was able to deliver Star Trek. Damn it! I don't really care much for Star Trek, but Abrams had me nearly crying at the start of that movie.Instead with Avengers we get another paint-by-numbers Superhero movie. You *can* make a Superhero movie with Heart! Look at the original Superman, or more recently Dark Knight and even Kick Ass. I want action and plenty of it, but I also want to connect with the characters on screen.The problem with Avengers is that connection isn't there and there's not a lot happening either. The production values are high, but that's no substitute for a plot. Until the CGI battle at the end, I was a kind of bored.",

    "reviewBody": "I felt compelled to review this, having just seen it 2 months after its release - the wait was agonising at times, but worth every second! Very few films have made me beam and laugh and cheer and clap so much. Terminator 2. Batman Begins. Iron Man. And a select handful of others.The Avengers is a little bit of a slow burner, but with delightful ingredients on the screen, it makes for a fabulous, explosive and tasty finish.I'd have to say, it was superbly orchestrated from start to finish, and the highlights must go to the Thor/Iron Man scuffle, and the grand finale which has - surprisingly - The Hulk as its main and certainly best attraction. After two average Hulk films, THIS one more than compensates for them, with humour (\"I'm always angry\") and punchiness (it stopping one of the megamonsters and slapping Loki around as it he were a Barbie doll - awesome!).Other highlights are the Cap telling the NYPD what to do and Loki's masterful interrogation by Romanoff.All in all, the best action I've seen in a few years. Cannot wait for them coming up against Thanos in AV2!",

I had seen enough and did not stay in the hall to watch the film from the start.I can't understand why this film got a 8.6 note. Perhaps everyone who participated logged in and gave it 10?

You know the one--it looks like the word NASCAR in motion with a bunch of colors coming off the left side like its a car I guess. Anyway, someone made a Tshirt that looks identical but instead of NASCAR it says BORING. Lol.Anyway, flash forward to me falling asleep in the movie, butt numb, and I keep picturing that Tshirt. Boring. This movie. Really boring.I think I fell asleep 3 times, for about 15 minutes total. Its hard to sleep too long because every now and then there is an explosion or some other loud whammo.The Dark Knight was WAY better than this. Spiderman was WAY better than this.Is it worthy of 1 star? No. Maybe it should be 3 or 4... But I'm giving the 1 to help offset some of the insane 10s I'm seeing on here. Seriously, there are people on IMDb saying its the best movie they have ever seen in their life. Really? Really!? Really. O.o I smell something fishy going on around here.The movie was completely vapid, boring, convoluted. Nothing about the movie was new or interesting.I'm assuming the score has been manipulated by social media, hopefully IMDb will do something about it. I look forward to seeing the score drop consistently for years to come, once whoever/whatever is driving this fake voting moves onto a new project.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's dumb simplistic movie, with nothing to say",
    "reviewBody": "I would describe director's Joss Wheddon effect as making live-action persons, behave, act and look more cartoonish than cartoons themselves. In the previous films at least they behave like humans.Really, wish Jhon Favreau had been given the creative freedom he requested. This movie makes X-men: The Last Stand look good.The cast is good, but the dialogue is terrible, interactions between characters are bad, people don't talk like real people, somehow all feel out of character, they talk like people throwing jokes to an audience which is painfully awkward to watch. Dangerously close to self parody territory, I refuse to believe parts of the movie happened.Fails on having a plot of it's own. Also fails as a sequel to the previous movies, and If you were doing, a marathon I would tell you to skip this as somehow despite featuring so many characters the plot is irrelevant to all of them.Half characters are portrayals is inconsistent to the previous movies: -Hulk has new actor and personality, the character is so rebooted it doesn't even feels like it happens in the same Cannon as the Hulk movie. -Loki goes from trying to become King by deceiving Thor out of Asgard, to making a genocidal killing spree on Earth (How does killing people on Earth helps him to become King Asgard? ANswer: It doesn't), Thor is told his brother kills people he says his bro is adopted (That's just awful dialogue, if Thor takes it as a joke, how am I supposed to take the movie seriously? There's no emotional conflict). -Captain America it's just there, but never does anything. -Ironman starts as a douche and by the end isn't, for the third time, the same transformation he experienced on Ironman 1, and also on Ironman 2. - The arrow guy is brainwashed, so he never really gets to talk, and the girl is a generic though token girl, that never gets developed. I would forgive the inconsistency if the movie were better than the previous incarnations, but it is worse.Somehow the army on the climax, looks CGI paper weight, they don't even put up a fight, makes it seem like even a normal civilian could hit and destroy them, with such a weak evil army why even bother in the first place. There's no twist, no stakes, never anything feels at risk. The heroes have the upper hand through the whole movie, they win without never ever making any effort. The action is disappointing, because it's just stupid hits, no stunts, no creative fight set pieces.The Dark Knight Rises deserved the Oscar Nomination, given to this film, Ironman Armor, and Hulk look good, but the CGI Army looks fake generic awful.If you watch it might entertain you, but movie is awful, if this becomes the future of Superhero movies, then the genre might die soon. Or even worse, continue like this for decades.Feel free to disagree but I think, Avengers it's so overrated.",

    "reviewTitle": "And The Winner Is",
    "reviewBody": "If there's a genre that's evolving and becoming better and better in the last decade, it's the adventure/comic genre; not solely a result of better CGI and cinematographic techniques, but there is also much better writing and acting, and in previous years, efforts by Nolan and Joe Johnston have been bypassed by critic and association entities because they are not a specific type of picture. It is certainly my hope this brilliant film doesn't suffer the same fate for it's great cinema all the way.With a superb cast that appears to embody each of the super heroes, and most intriguingly, their own stunts, we are treated to a very exciting two hours plus at the movies where the Earth is once again in danger of being overcome by an alien race, and somehow, story lines from several films are tied together neatly. Eventually, they all become a cohesive whole, and the results are MARVELous!! The film is terrific, and it might not reach the levels of perfection that we saw in \"The Dark Knight\", a movie so magnificent in its structure and sustained by terrific writing and acting. There's certainly no villain like the Joker here, but the evil forces are sufficient enough to warrant a cry for help, so that we need our heroes to come and kick some alien butt. It's definitely a showcase for all involved: Renner, Downey (much warmer) than in any of his previous turns as Ironman, Johanssen is magnificent, Evans is fantastic, Hemsworth is royal like in his turn, but the best turn out there is sheer force of nature that Ruffalo gives to the Hulk. He certainly walks away with the picture, yet everyone else gives him plenty of competition for the spotlight.The film is a crowd pleaser, with plenty of terrific set pieces, leading to an extraordinary third act, a piece of cinematic action rarely seen before, where every element moves so smoothly, it can make your heart soar when you see what really good films can achieve. It certainly doesn't remind me of some of the films that have been recognized in the last decade, as the best that cinema can offer. Good film do not have to be serious; they have to be well made, regardless of what the subject matter is, and \"The Avengers\" once have proved just how amazing solid script writing (by one person, not a whole team of creative ideas) can give you when you combine with top of the line special effects. It's truly a joy to see Jackson sharp tuning a role we have seen before, but it's now full of pizazz.There are some terrific possibilities coming our way later this year, and I am looking forward to the amazing offerings by Nolan, Scott, and Sonnenfield, but they have a battle uphill trying to match this wonderful movie. Watch, learn, and learn to give credit where credit is due. This is cinema at its best.",

    "reviewTitle": "Be ready for a HULK sized experience.",
    "reviewBody": "I've waited with baited breathe to see this movie for 4 years, ever since Sam Jackson turned up at the end of Iron Man in 2008 and uttered those words that made Marvel fans around the world weep happy tears: \"I'm here to talk about the Avengers initiative\". After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enough.The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. It's all pretty usual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. It's in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasn't expecting: a family comedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain America's and Thor's expense are great (\"Easy there Point Break\") with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the film's climax, Hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the film's main weakness, Marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lee's 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the film's biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Bruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time ever that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and applause when Chris Evans delivered the line: \"Hulk, SMASH!\" and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.A few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renner's unbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 Marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure her sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the Stan Lee cameo is present of course.Which brings us to the film's action sequences. They are astounding.Like Transformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America try to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then there's the climactic \"glorious war!\" which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can throw any enemies you want at The Avengers.The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero; brilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedon's directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or \"kiddy\" (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to it's better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.My one BIG problem with the film was the untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasn't even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can only hope.Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google \"Thanos\" and the \"Infinity Gauntlet\" when you get home.All in all it was GREAT fun & I honestly can not wait for Whedon's Directors's Cut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to incorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these characters.REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many years to come.9/10 Well and truly Assembled.",

Is it good? does it still hold up? the answer is no. I admit, the first time i saw this movie in theaters, i was having a blast and enjoying it very much. However, the film gets worse for me each time i give it a second watch. The film is centered around Loki(played by Tom Hiddleston), who wants to take over the world, while the avengers work out their ways to stop him. It is as generic and lazy as it sounds. The film barely has any story or even character development/interaction. It's nothing but one liners and action. None of the characters have a defined personality. Tony Stark is a one dimensional clown, Thor is has the charm of a wood that speaks in a Shakespearean way, black widow and hawkeye are nearly the same, only their gender are different. Hulk has his moments, and captain America is one of the most boring comic book characters i have ever seen in this movie. It's basically a Michael Bay movie minus the women objectifying, but same level of obnoxious and out dated film making. One of the most overrated trash movies i have ever seen.

Each of the actors chosen for the roles draws their character on like a glove, and the fit is perfect. This is what separates The Avengers from most other movies in this genre - the characters have depth, their interaction with each other is real and eminently believable, and the willful suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this type of movie is so effortless as to be unnoticeable. The CGI effects are spectacular, as is to be expected, and kudos to the designers for some really over-the-top bad guys and hardware. If I have one minor quibble, it is that I wanted more from Colbie Smulders as agent Hill. Her screen presence is so intense that I kept waiting (and wanting) more from her than to just be Samuel Jackson's aide-de-camp. Ah well, maybe next time.",

    "reviewBody": "I heard people call The avengers a tour de force, a perfect box-office bonanza, the wickedest ride of their lives and best movie ever! I can only assume that every single one of them is a comic book freak and are all obsessed by every Marvel hero and villain. I can tell you I'm a movie buff but I'm not a comic book freak. In my opinion that shouldn't matter because dark knight for instance, is one of my favorite movies of all time. I know it's not from Marvel but DC comics but I also liked the first iron man movie (he turned into a narcissistic bastard after the first and I didn't like that character development) So I'm not gonna write a movie off just because I'm not a huge Marvel fan.But after 2 1/2 hours of sitting through the deluge of explosions, \"witty\" banter, and generic story-telling. I was happy the movie ended, all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw. My plan was just to go home and put on a real movie. With plot twists and character development, both things I missed in the avengers. You could say it's fast paced but if the story doesn't grab you by the balls, it's all irrelevant. The only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious, too bad it didn't mean to be.I knew after five minutes that the movie wasn't going to live up to the hype. And it was only downhill from there to be honest. The last sequence was the worst in my book. The alien invasion was so stupid, we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole. And what came to wipe out all of humanity? A few hundred Chitauri, wow... is that an invasion? Six avengers got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them. That was a huge anti-climax!I think this movie is very overrated and only worth a view if you're tired and want some brainless 'entertainment', other than that it really is only for the comic book geeks. And maybe teenagers who've been brainwashed with years of Asian (fighting) cartoons. Oh yeah, the movie I watched when I got home was snatch!",

    "reviewBody": "Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. For those of you who don't know who this man is, he's been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedon's first big feature film, it's also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thor's brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedon's script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, \"Let's dance\" as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage – a lot of damage!It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust \"fan boys\" with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the \"prequels\" and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his \"I am a God\" speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the film's final act – the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesn't get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didn't pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.I have long appreciated Whedon's film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.This is the BEST comic book – SUPERHERO – film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by.",

    "reviewTitle": "Hulk vs Loki.",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers (2012): Dir: Joss Whedon / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson: Here at long last is a combination of comic book superheros brought to the screen to the delight of fans. Hopefully nobody will confuse the title with that crap handed John Steed Emma Peel 1998 film that everyone wanted nothing to do with. Perhaps a title change? We have a host of superheros including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The villain is Loki of the Thor film and he has a world domination scheme that is every bit as corny as any other world domination scheme. That doesn't matter because viewers will attend to see the combination of powers become a reality. Loki is a great villain and thankfully he is targeted by all of these heroes thus giving us great action sequences. His run-in with the Hulk is especially amusing. Joss Whedon is the right director to bring this spectacular together and the special effects created are explosive. Whedon also gives each cast member a good fair share of time. We have Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark / Iron Man whose sarcasm is a scene stealer. Chris Evans is thawed and ready as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth as Thor sets to bring Loki back to his planet for justice. Mark Ruffalo is terrific filling in as the Hulk whose anger is subdued until fans are given the payoff in full blown green fury. Scarlett Johansson oozes sexiness as Black Widow, a skilled spy trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. Third act descends to action combination of the various talented ensemble that is a thrill. Score: 9 / 10",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel Universe so utterly a dull place",
    "reviewBody": "As a 1960s Marvel and DC comics fan I have watched the film adaptations with interest over the years and frankly have been rather disappointed. Poorest of all is the Marvel Universe of comic characters. A bunch of dullards dressed up as something interesting and worst of all is when they get together as in this the first outing of The Avengers. Tony Stark's Iron Man is the worst of an utterly boring bunch but only just as he has some serious competition from the less than one dimensional Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America. The plot what there was of it was lamentable and the hopeless friction between the super heroes seemed nothing more than a way to pan out two hours rather than adding anything to the actual movie. Nick Fury added a bit of interest but was underused and SHIELD looked more like the Men From UNCLE with a bit of Captain Scarlet thrown in but less interesting. Loki was a very poor villain and the alien invasion was one of the worst ever conceived. This type of film is made for a very intellectually challenged American audience and had all the ingredients to satisfy them. Lots of explosions and plenty of American flags to cheer at. But I always thought Marvel's characters were a lot more interesting than this bunch of costumed bores. Maybe I saw it through rose tinted shades back then but what I remember was a lot better than this tripe. I will admit Thor, Captain America and the new Hulk film were reasonably well done but Iron Man I and II left me cold and I was a big fan of him as a kid. But the Avengers was a mess. The DC side (Green Lantern aside) has for me been done a lot better especially the Batman adaptations. Marvel not so, sadly. One of the worst bits was the sentimentality card played via a rather sad and pathetic Agent Coulson who up till thn had been a rather interesting character. This device used to galvanise the fractured super force into an unstoppable storm of red white and blue and some green. The witty one liners become tired and overused as the film drags itself to an inevitable conclusion and the final battle in Manhattan was done better in Cloverfield. It's a shame as these guys were my heroes as a kid in the 60s but now as an old man all I see are a bunch of prats in Halloween costumes. Luckily I have the final Batman movie still to watch so it's not all doom and gloom in the costume hero stakes but this lot should be retired as they are nothing but frauds.",

    "reviewTitle": "Eh?",
    "reviewBody": "I don't get it.Not that it was a bad movie. It was fun. It was okay.But some surprisingly poor filmmaking. It doesn't help that I loathe hand-held camera. You spend all this money and then muddy up the shots with a hand-held? It's the cancer on the testicles of cinematography. Buy a dolly, or tripod or Steadicam.I'm just glad that I didn't see this in 3D (which is another head-scratcher for me). Stargate or Independence Day was shot better. Any Hong Kong action movie is shot better. Any Jackie Chan movie is shot better.The story was better than average. A good amount of very bad and stilted dialog, though. Loki's ulterior motive on being captured was amazingly transparent.Acting was generally good. I don't know if you call what Downey does as \"acting\". It's him being charming, which works most of the time. But Scarlette? A looker but not getting much better at her \"craft\".And I thought it was just silly to see her face-off with the alien invasion with a handgun.And did Hawkeye's arrows magically replenish themselves 3, 4, 5 times during the final battle? Hemmesworth will be a very good actor in ten years. But he's okay now. But too small to be Thor, though.And please! How was the final battle not a carbon copy of Transformers 3? I liked Serenity. And Cabin in the Woods. But I think Josh was in over his head on this.",

I can't wait to go and watch it again, with the misses and our boy.I had some apprehension regarding how Hawkeye was being portrayed in some of the trailers. He seemed to have little dialogue, and screen time, as a Hawkeye fan, I was afraid he was going to get shortchanged in the film. I was also wondering how they were going to work in all the characters with such a large cast.

All of our favorite superhero's coming together to take down a common enemy in the form Thor's adopted brother Loki(Tom Huddleston) who wants to rule earth and will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goals.In addition to that they also have to learn to get along with each other if they want to save the world. The acting, writing, action and effects are awesome. The jokes always hit, the cast have great chemistry and the action's just cool to watch. The fight scenes are well choreographed and really get your blood flowing. I won't give away the final fight scene but it's epic.That's the best way I can describe this movie: epic.

    "reviewBody": "...this film wasn't good at all. With the exception of the excitement of seeing all these leading characters in one movie, I fail to see why everyone has been running and running to this movie. First of all, the acting is terrible, led by Chris Evans as a far-too-earnest Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth as a heavily accented Thor with dialogue that made sense hundreds of years ago, but not in 2012. Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Scarlett Johansson are decent enough, but no Academy Award nominees there. The plot and many of the sub-plots were difficult to follow, as the primary purpose of this movie was to show cars, buildings, and people being blown up. I understand that I'm not in this movie's target demographic, but the X-Men series and Iron Man were far more intelligent and interesting than this. Yes, I know this will be one of the highest grossing pictures of all-time, which is why I wanted to know what all the fuss was. Yes, I know there will be many sequels generated from this, which makes sense. Just count me out from going to see them.",

    "reviewBody": "First of all, I am a fan of superhero movies. But Marvel, with Iron Man 2 and now this monstrosity, is losing me.I had mixed expectations before seeing this movie, and I went out of it depressed about the state of the movie-making industry and more specifically, the fate of superhero stories.If that is the kind of scenario which deserves to be acclaimed from every corner, why should directors like Christopher Nolan keep working on adding depth and substance to their movies if immature and empty scenarios such as The Avengers can earn as much praise? I am clueless. OK there needs to be movies for teenagers and I am fine with that, but that does not mean it should be praised as much as The Godfather.The Avengers, really, can be summarized as two hours of four superheroes fighting each other over the location of some blue cube because Loki wanted it so, just like drunken guys in any tavern, and who finally come together to fight (again) in a huge alien battle on Manhattan against aliens who can't shoot straight, have fragile weaponry, and who are led by a demi-god, Loki, who ends up being simply beaten up by Hulk with his bare-hands, no questions asked, just as if Batman would destroy Superman because it makes for a funny ending.If anyone can add anything of substance to what I have just described, only with sarcasm I admit, I am willing to hear about it.This was a poor movie, and how well it was received by critics shows how big corporations like Disney now control the industry with propaganda in order to create mass hysteria.

    "reviewTitle": "A comic and not a relief",
    "reviewBody": "Guess I expected more but shouldn't from a comic book company. I did think that much of the acting was above par and quite good in many instances. However, the poor relationship to obeying or at least extending the laws of physics was just inexcusable. I'll try to precisely explain my sentiments: 1) what's the logic in having an aircraft carrier fly? A runway on a ship that's supposedly capable of flying? If it's possible to make a ship like that fly, then wouldn't it also be possible to have other flying craft that don't need a runway? Get a scientist to review your scripts before hand!2) The scant one-liners from Robert Downey, Jr's character were annoying at best. Guess he's an ADD/ADHD character trying to appeal to multitude of ADD/ADHD fans?3) All the hand waving over and around computer screens reminded me of the bad attempt at impressing the viewer that occurred in \"Minority Report\" Make the hand waving meaningful and minimal. If those screens were really needed, then Dr. Banner/Hulk would have gotten some use/knowledge or gained something from all his hand waving over supposedly touch-sensitive screens. Yet, both he and Mr. Downey (and others) seems obsessed with waving their hands around - for what? I did enjoy Samuel Jackson's character when he responded to the lame navigator's excuse \"the navigation system is reinitializing...\" and he says is the \"Sun up, then put it on your left\" That was the most genuine moment in the whole film.I expected the superior plot and complexity of \"Thor\" but was sadly disappointed with an rehash of \"Independence\" style special effects and a lame story of alien invaders. All this mediocrity probably didn't impact the title's earnings. I just won't be so enthused about catching a sequel. Maybe worth a Netflix or video store rental but not a theater ticket!",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers (2012, Joss Whedon) Feige and Marvel continue to set the high water mark for super hero movies... everybody else is playing catch up",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers (2012, Joss Whedon) (A)\nI do have to hand it to Marvel and Kevin Feige. They pulled it off. So often something of this magnitude sounds amazing on paper or in theory, but rarely does it have the follow through especially when it comes to movies. This movie, however, is a home run in just about every sense of the word. After five films devoted primarily to the four main Avengers it is finally time for them to assemble and battle a threat worthy of this super team. Every primary actor returns with the notable exception of Edward Norton who is replaced by Mark Ruffalo who we would come to know as the MCU's face of the Hulk going forward. This super team will remain more or less together in this primary incarnation blowing our super hero film loving minds through 'Endgame' in 2019. Joss Whedon does a stellar job as a geek fanboy extraordinaire in the director's chair. This film combines a wonderful script with depth and plenty of the on the nose humor that these MCU films have excelled at. We get a villain in Loki and his alien invasion army worthy of the team and the stakes. None of the characters are short changed. They all get their moments to shine. The action scenes are wonderful especially the big finale battle that in itself must be practically thirty minutes of continuous action.The action stems from bad guy Loki, Thor's half brother, who, under the auspice of a mysterious benefactor, comes to Earth with a scepter of unknown power. His motives are mysterious, but ultimately it is revealed he is opening a way, utilizing the Tesseract from the Captain America film, for an alien army to invade Earth from space. He is initially demure in a deceitful attempt to divide our collective heroes, but really only serves to bring them together stronger against the adverse odds. Loki's spear also has a mind control power and he brings both Hawkeye and Selvig under his power further complicating the situation. There are some opening sequences once Loki is revealed bringing our heroes together finally, and despite some initial communication issues, and getting to know you stuff, they eventually reveal themselves to have great chemistry and camaraderie. The initial scene where Cap is fighting Loki and Iron Man swoops in is excellent as well as the subsequent scene where Thor, Captain and Iron Man initially fight over who should have custody of Loki before reaching an understanding. Hulk's appearances in the film are done excellently, but the moment of the film probably belongs to Tony in a singular self sacrifice when he flies a nuke through hole in space from which the invading army is entering from. He, in one stroke, destroys what remains of the army in space as well as diverting the nuke that was sent to destroy the aliens, and the island of Manhattan as collateral damage. The army is destroyed and the Avengers are assembled and Earth's mightiest heroes are here to keep us entertained for years to come.Until 'Endgame' came along this was the standard by which every other MCU film was measured. There may be slight issues here and there, but they are so slight as to nary merit a discussion. Everything here is operating at the highest level from script and direction to special effects to the actors essentially inhabiting these roles. At the end we even get the famous Marvel post credit scene which is the first appearance of the uber villain Thanos who would come to dominate the MCU narrative in the years to come. My love for this movie and all it accomplishes and represents cannot be overstated. We struggled through a lot of dark years with regards to super hero films. There were horrible writing jobs and horrible effects but we ate them up because at least they were something. Tim Burton started making it better but really the golden age commenced in 2008 with 'Iron Man' and Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. No longer do we have to settle for sub standard comic book super hero fare. The MCU put an amazing capstone on their Phase One endeavor, and they would move forward and continue to impress and build on this world with every outing. This film is a triumph in every way.Eric's Grade: A.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers- Best movie of the year so far. Fans salivate, non fans- prepare to get converted!",
    "reviewBody": "The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be \"hilariously out gunned\" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- \"billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist\"- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an \"oh so serious\" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- \"hold on\", he seems to say, \"the solution is just round the corner\"- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun.",

    "reviewTitle": "Can we trust IMDb ratings",
    "reviewBody": "How can this film be rated 8+. IMHO it was absolutely average. Apart from Robert Downey's sarcastic/acerbic humour the film's remaining characters were hampered by a poor plot line and an inconsistent/juvenile comic book narrative that's holed below the water line by contradictions. Marvel need to look to writers like Garth Ennis to see how comics should be done.Costumes were embarrassingly bad; Loki's plastic horns and staff, Captain America's camp tights and Thor's spandex.Has the IMDb score been artificially inflated, is it a case of the Emperor's new clothes, or is it Marvel fan-boys? I don't know, but it ain't worth more than 5 or 6 on the IMDb Richter scale.",

    "reviewBody": "I have struggled with the four previous MCU films, I just did not find any of the characters relatable. I feel that this movie rewards you for watching the previous ones. Everything I hate about the characters the other characters are aware of and I then can relate to them this way, I don't believe this was the intention but it works for me. Also you can enjoy this film if you haven't seen the earlier MCU films because it doesn't go too deep into the characters, you just need to know the basics to enjoy it but it gives you a bit more understanding if you haven't. I think the balance between humour and tension is excellent. It is very funny when it needs to be. This could have so easily have been a disaster but I feel it is the simple story and excellent cast and the right dose of humour that makes it great. I also think if they had started with this the franchise would not have been as successful, it is the slow at times agonising build up to this that sets it apart from other franchises. It also makes sure it leaves enough for future films.",

    "reviewBody": "Does anyone remember how you or other children when you were young was playing with action figures and came up with the most crappy adventures you can imagine? Like when Batman and Buzz Lightyear climbed your parent's bookshelf, Godzilla splashed and murdered The Lego figures in the bathtub filled with foam, or when He-man saved Barbie from The Street Sharks? Well ... It must have been that kind of games that Joss Whedon was playing that made him think of this extremely embarrassing and bad idea of a movie.The Avengers is the definition of what a bad American action movie produced in Hollywood is. I understand why Marvel emptied out the whole toy box when they made the comic in the 60's so children could have something to read when they pooped on the toilet so it stank mashed potatoes with spinach, but who comes up with the idea to make a movie today, in the beginning of the second millennium, which is about a soldier from the 40's waking up from a coma after several years, only to discover that The Hulk, Ironman and some damn archer wants to fight gangsters and monsters with him. And not to forget! a god from another planet with a big hammer. So what's the plot? Exactly, what is this movie about more than that all these famous cartoon characters meet each other and it's epic for the win? Apparently that they are going to stop the mischievous Loki and his alien army from enslaving humanity. Wow! That sounds almost as exciting as if Scrooge Mcduck built a large magnet which robbed humanity of all the money in the world and The Avengers were forced to team up with Donald Duck and his nephews. A movies like that would break the roof on Box Office in no time. Because that's what it's all about, to make money and sell more toys to children. If you want to see animated characters get together, you might as well see The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones or House of Mouse instead.This is the worst and most embarrassing movie I've ever seen.Seeing this movie was as disgusting as eating at McDonald's after a long road trip filled with vomit and radio music. Those of you who appreciate this kind of movies might as well play pocket pool with candy in your mouths. DISGUSTING!",

    "reviewTitle": "Very Impressive And Well Worth The Wait",
    "reviewBody": "It has been a long time since I've anticipated a summer movie season as much as I've anticipated 2012's. And what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies of...well if not the decade, then at least the last 5 years. The Avengers was a very impressive accomplishment by Joss Whedon, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time. This was going to take some skill as a movie-maker. How in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these larger-than-life characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good? How would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all main-character and lead actor? And to answer those questions, all I can really say is this: I don't know. And after seeing the movie, I still don't know. All I know is that it was done, and it was done very well. I have to admit, when I found out Whedon was going to be at the helm for this one, I had some doubts (which, I'll admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer). However, after seeing Cabin In The Woods a few weeks ago, I saw what Whedon was able to accomplish with what was, technically a film that goes into the horror genre, but really was one of the best and unique films I've seen in a long time. And even though he was only a script writer for Cabin, anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy. So at that point I was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with The Avengers, and after seeing it tonight, it's safe to say that Whedon was certainly quite up for this task. If you love movies then go see this one. It has the action, it has the acting, and more than anything (and is so important when it comes to a film like this) it has the story and script. This is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for. But, and this is the good part, it's also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie. So, the summer movie season has officially arrived. And now, the rest of the season has its work cut out for it.",

    "reviewTitle": "In a nutshell: a must-see",
    "reviewBody": "This movie is frankly excellent. Watching it for the first time up until the fifth time (which for me was after Winter Soldier came out) was very very thrilling. To had a plot, first of all; one that might not show itself well the first time around, but is there nonetheless. No character doesn't *need* to be present, and no character is out of place. Stark is there because of his father's affiliations with the Tesseract-goings-on, and later his new tower becomes the location of Loki's space-bridge-machine, because of his new energy that he created in Iron Man 2. Cap is there because, well, the Tesseract is the subject of the film's conflict. He is neither cannon fodder nor useless - sure, his action sequences in this movie aren't outstanding like they are amazingly in CA:WS, but since that movie existed afterwards, it doesn't matter. Thor is there because his brother is the antagonist; he in fact has more reason to be in the circle of protagonists more than the other Avengers. Banner is present because he was needed to locate the Tesseract when it was stolen (plain and simple), Barton because, well, he was a Shield agent at the first facility we see, overtaken by Loki's scepter, then et cetera. And Romanoff because, well, she's a major Shield agent who is an elite fighter, as well as the only female of the team.As for the biggest plot-complaints I have seen: The reason Loki wanted to be captured on the Helicarrier is so that he could disturb the harmony of the team and \"set off\" Hulk, knowing also that with his teleport-trick he'd be able to Lure Thor and escape... and lastly the reason Banner in New York, after arriving by motorcycle, is able to immediately turn into the Hulk, is because of the ability that is evident at the very end of Incredible Hulk; him being able to voluntarily become angry. No single Avenger dominates the plot. This movie has clever transitions when each Avenger is first seen, has no ex-machinas, no over-abundance of jokes, absolutely no lack of clever lines and dialogue (I refer mainly to Loki w/ Fury), no lack of six-vs-aliens action, great acting, and a sensible ending. Whedon's direction/directing of this film is more than \"meh pretty good\" - and this movie was only overrated when its fan-hype was still alive. It doesn't \"become more mediocre of a film\" once more thrilling MCU installments have come out.",

So when I saw this for the first time in theatres I was in awe.The film does a phenomenal job of managing the amount of characters it has. Each character has a purpose and each character is interesting.Iron Man for me was extremely unlikeable in Iron Man 2 but in this I liked him a lot. There are moments when he is still a douche but most of the time he is showing that he is meant to be there and that he wants to help people.This was the first time we see Mark Ruffalo has Bruce Banner. I think he did better than Norton did, he brings a more humanistic tone to the character.Black Widow was given much more screen time in this than she was given in Iron Man 2 and Scarlett Johanssen did great.Tom Hiddleston is the perfect person to play Loki. His ability to portray this menace of a god is amazing. I will say the plot of Loki wanting to conquer the earth is very simplistic but that didn't bother me much.The gripes I have with the film is the first 50 minutes or so is very slow. They find the proper pacing once everyone is together but the beginning wasn't paced well. Also strongly dislike Captain Americas suit. It is cheesy and doesn't fit well.The Avengers is every kids dream come to life. It is perfectly acted and Joss Whedons ability to manage that amount of characters is amazing. Although slow and simplistic at times the plot is highly entertaining and suits the movie well.9/10.",

I can' believe how people actually like this stuff, maybe they slept all the way through it, I can't say. This movie brings absolutely nothing new or interesting to the big screen. It's totally predictable and not funny, it contains so many lame jokes that it makes you feel a bit nauseated at some points. The action is stupid and seen before in older and better movies. The plot is... Wait a second, what plot? The only positive thing in this movie is Robert Downey Jr, but he alone cannot make up for all the flaws that exist in this movie. Certain points in the movie feel very long, and I assume this is because of the actors lack of talent, they are dull and have no feelings. And I laughed every time captain America was show on the screen, his mask looks absolutely hilarious. And I laughed even harder when some of the evil space dudes pulled of his mask, because I'd bet that even the film crew found him looking ridiculous in that outfit.I guess The Avengers is a good movie if you find trouble sleeping one night, just put it on, and you'll be sleeping in no time",

    "reviewTitle": "The ending is spoiled on the trailer!!!",
    "reviewBody": "So, I watched the trailer for \"The Avengers\". It has Loki bragging he has an army, to which Tony Stark/Iron Man replies that they have The Hulk...I supposed that, maybe, if I didn't know absolutely anything about The Hulk from the comics, I wouldn't have predicted the ending of the film with that. I mean, they had The Hulk... So what? Considering the cool and calm way Mr. Stark said that, I could conclude that he thought (or, more likely, had it for granted) that the so-called \"Hulk\" was so powerful that anything, even a whole army, thrown on it wouldn't even tickle. It just happens that's the case in the film.Unlike most superheroes, The Hulk has no Achilles Heel (apart from himself). The more things you throw on The Hulk, the stronger he becomes, infinitely and exponentially. That piece of information is not presented on this film, as far as I can remember (and not even in any of The Hulk films, but I don't remember most of them, so I can't be sure), but it wasn't necessary. The morons that cut that trailer should have known better than to put that Robert \"Tony\" Downey \"Stark\" Jr.'s one-liner on the it. Yes, it spoiled the ending for me, and no, I didn't watch the trailer on purpose, it was shown when I went to the theatre to watch something else (I was so shocked by the spoiling trailer that I can't even remember what I went to watch, then).This film is boring, uninspired, over-hyped, so badly scripted/plotted that it can't even be called \"pretentious\" (is that good or bad, for a film of this genre?!) and the visual effects are so exaggerated that everything looks fake. Even so, it has one of the best lines of all superheroes films I've seen. It comes like this, the film starts, there is a lot of boring/annoying bla-bla-blah and, after Mr. Stark tells Loki that they have The Hulk, Bruce Banner reappears, someone says him that it would be good if he could get angry, to which Dr. Banner replies... Sorry, even with \"spoilers on\", I can't force myself to tell you this. If you don't want to watch this film (if I hadn't, I wouldn't, believe me, it's really that boring), go to a search engine site and look for \"The Avengers Hulk angry secret\" and watch a clip of the scene, because it's THE ONLY piece of all of it that is worth watching. I can't say that that alone would be worth the price of admission, but it surely put a smile on my bored face.10 stars for Dr. Bruce Banner's one line, -7 for all the rest.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is another typical US production: great FX, lame story, even lamer lines for the actors (espcially Hiddleston, whose character is completely wasted, even though he plays his (mad) part very good), only Downey has his usually funny highlights but this cannot save the movie. When I have figures like Thor and Loki I try to build a more mythical, special story and don't end up with the ever so boring same mankind vs. whoever fight, marking the enemy almost unbeatable at the beginning and then ending up with some metal monster that the Hulk can bring down. What more or less usual humans like Black Widow and Hawkeye can do to survive such a battlefield for super heroes is beyond my understanding, too. Not to mention the usual showcasing of US equipment (F-35 e.g.) and a \"skycarrier\" which in some way made me think of \"Space Battleship Yamato\". And last but not least no one of the ones responsible seems to have read Marvel comics when they have been young; I did, and there's no way that Iron Boy and Miss America could hold up to Thor and Hulk. How did Iron Man put it correctly in the comics (with regard to Thor/Hulk): \"With enough energy I can keep up with those guys (on the Super Hero top list)...for two seconds.\" The end with interviews and statements on the streets and of course before that the use of nukes to close the portal brought my till then five stars vote down to three. Why for whose sake ever is the enemy superior when we have nukes and they don't? How could nukes close a portal made of pure energy from the cube which is - because of this fact - impenetrable? Unbearable US simplicity and shallowness.",

    "reviewTitle": "Whedon is an amazing assembler",
    "reviewBody": "I went to see this with a few friends and one of them described it probably as well as can be. He called it probably the best comic book adaptation he's ever seen. Of course, what it's adapting is one of those all out action issues so there's not a whole lot of depth and significance to what happens. This is about good energetically punching evil in the nose while Joss Whedon's style of comedy flows in and out like a rapid tide. But while you can't put this on the same narrative level as The Dark Knight or even Batman Begins or Superman II, this is one kick ass thrill ride of a motion picture. It is stuffed to the gills with so much great stuff that Whedon deserves some sort of award just for keeping it all from collapsing in on itself.Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the Asgardian god of mischief who was lost to the void at the end of the Thor movie, returns here in service to an alien horde. He comes to Earth and steals the tessaract, the glowing blue box from the Captain America movie, and seeks to use it to open a portal that will allow the alien army to invade and conquer the world. To stop him, super-spy Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson. Loki, meanwhile, uses his power to seize control of the minds of Professor Selvig (from the Thor movie) to construct his portal and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to assist him. A whole lot of fighting ensues, particularly on the incredible S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and the streets and skies of New York City, as The Avengers try to defeat Loki and repel the alien threat.Let me say again, Joss Whedon does a tremendous job hear managing all the moving parts in this script and the production. There's a very large cast of characters and they're all put to some use and there are a whole lot of special effects and action scenes, nearly all of which are spectacular. There's also likely more humor here than in any Marvel super-hero flick to date and while some of it is a bit much in that way Whedon always goes for a laugh just as the tension or drama is kicking into high gear, most of it is simply damn funny.Unsurprisingly, Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark pretty much owns every scene he's in, but Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo prove to be excellent sparring partner for RDJ in their scenes together. Scarlett Johansson is also very effective in a surprisingly large role. Whedon is known for his female characters and he's taken Jonhasson's window dressing role from Iron Man II and remade her into a tough, smart woman who still blanches a bit at being normal amongst geniuses, super-humans and extradimensional gods. I do have to say that large doses of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury turns out to a better idea in theory than in practice, sort of like Mace Windu, but Cobie Smulders does a nice job as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and Clark Gregg is wonderful as Agent Coulson.If you're looking for a good time, I'm not sure there's any way you'll be disappointed by The Avengers. If you are, maybe you need to stop going to see this kind of films. I wasn't that impressed with either the Thor or Captain America movies and felt Iron Man II was burdened with having too much stuff crammed into it. I am impressed with this film, even though it's packed to the brim with even more. It's made me excited about a possible Black Widow movie and hopeful of seeing Ruffalo in yet another Hulk film, as long as Whedon's involved.Not that you need to hear this from me, but don't miss this.",

    "reviewBody": "Avengers is a splendid movie, and that's saying after having quite large expectations. True, I liked most of the recent super hero movie (except Iron Man 2 which was a bust) but Avengers excelled and outshine them all. I feared that putting all the super heroes together would make them cancel each other out, but instead it let them exploit their individual strengths. For example, Iron Man's sharp comments and one-liners are better and sharper than ever.But above all, Avengers is an almost perfect mix of comedy and action. It says a lot when a movie running at 142 minutes never even feels long or have parts that loses tempo. Avengers is a non-stop action, without ever becoming repetitive, and spiced up with gems of humor, one-liners and jokes. Whedon should have a lot of credit for both writing and directing this with a good story but extreme care for the details. Such skill is rare and makes Avengers to an action movie masterpiece. To mention a few details I loved was Hulk's punch to Thor and Iron Man's nick Capsicle of Captain America. I only frowned when the chitauris spontaneously died when their mothership was blown up (felt too much SW 1 about it) as they were biological creatures, not robots. But that was a minor point, and the only I can recall.The casting is great and all the actors and actresses do their parts very well. An honorable extra mention to Tom Hiddleston (surprised) that in my mind makes Loki perfect, Robert Downey Jr for his brilliant one-liners and Mark Ruffalo that perhaps plays the best Hulk ever.I have to think back quite some time since I was so fully entertained by a movie. I hope sincerely there is a sequel (in the care of Whedon). There certainly is an opening for it.9/10",

Lots of cars flying around. Good guys win. Why does this movie do better? Don't ask me. I'm not saying the movie was terrible, it was enjoyable for the most part (Downey had some awesome one liners!) but it wasn't spectacular.

    "reviewTitle": "One of the Best Super Hero Epics!!!",
    "reviewBody": "Since the epilogue in \"Iron Man\" (2008) when Nick Fury broached the idea of the Avengers Initiative to wisecracking Tony Stark, Marvel Comics has been patiently whetting our appetites for \"The Avengers.\" This imaginative ensemble epic assembles not only Iron Man and Hulk, but also Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. Agent Phil Coulson is back, too. Ostensibly, these paragons of virtue are all that stand between Thor's scheming step-brother Loki and the fate of mankind. Happily, Loki brings more to the table than he did in Kenneth Branagh's anemic \"Thor.\" Indeed, Thor and Loki seem to have matured considerably during the interim. Loki ranks as a first-rate villain; he is ready, willing, and eager to kill anybody who confronts him, and actor Tom Hiddleston relishes every moment. Ultimately, \"The Avengers\" qualifies as Marvel's ambitious attempt to deliver an all-star, no-holds-barred, alien invasion thriller to rival both \"Independence Day\" and \"Transformers\" franchise. Of course, we know that our heroes won't capitulate, but this 142-minute, PG-13 extravaganza takes everything down to the wire. Inevitably, the extraterrestrial villain--only hardcore Marvel Comics fans may recognize him—who boasts about subjugating Earth is as presumptuous as audiences who fail to appreciate the artistry of \"The Avengers.\" Unlike other ensemble pieces—like the venerable \"Star Trek\" movies that always relegated some regulars to obscurity, \"The Avengers\" gives everybody a chance to perform an integral part in this larger-than-life smackdown. Reportedly, \"Serenity\" director Joss Whedon shot more footage of Captain America than reached the screen. Nevertheless, the fish-out-of-water, World War II hero still participates in a major way. Melodramatic, with more humor than you might imagine, but just enough tragedy to make things bittersweet, \"The Avengers\" doesn't wear out its welcome. Moreover, this far-fetched nonsense holds up under repeated showings. I've seen it four times, and it loses none of its spontaneity.\"The Avengers\" opens with audacious Asgardian exile Loki (Tom Hiddleston of \"Archipelago\") cutting a deal with malevolent aliens elsewhere in the galaxy and then appropriating a formidable source of energy, the Tesseract, from Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) SHIELD outfit. If you're interested, the Tesseract showed up initially in \"Captain America, the First Avenger.\" Once Loki gets his power-hungry hands on the Tesseract, he plans to unlock a portal in space with the expertise of Professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård of \"Thor\") so an extraterrestrial horde, the Chitauri, can invade Earth. The Chitauri are reptilian warriors with humanoid body structure in silver armor that cruise the skies as trios in chariots. Along the way, Loki recruits Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner of \"The Hurt Locker\") to do his evil bidding with the help of his glowing scepter. Meanwhile, Fury recruits his own team, first persuading Steve Rogers (Chris Evans of \"The Fantastic Four\") who has not quite grown accustomed to the 21st century to join him. Chiefly, Captain America doesn't know what most of the popular phrases mean. Former Russian spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) heads off to Calcutta to round up Dr. Banner. Eventually, Iron Man shows up, too. Thor barges him when he discovers that Loki is up to no good. Everybody boards a futuristic aircraft carrier that does more than ply the seas. Whedon does a masterly job of interspersing comedy with drama. Moreover, he manages to ante up enough time for each hero to make a contribution as they struggle to defeat Loki.Whedon's \"The Avengers\" emerges as the climax to several recent Marvel Comics super hero escapades. Thor and Captain America toplined their own respective origins stories and generated well over a $100-million in box office receipts. If you've been keeping track of Marvel movies, you know the least successful super hero of the quartet is the Hulk. Unlike \"Iron Man,\" \"Thor,\" and \"Captain America,\" the pugnacious green gargantuan never formulated the right mix of leading actor, atmosphere, and narrative tone. Marvel's two \"Hulk\" movies failed to forge a charismatic hero after Marvel's major success with him on prime time television. Director Ang Lee's \"Hulk\" (2003), with Eric Bana as the title character, took itself far too seriously and tackled unpleasant issues such as child abuse. Marvel rebooted the character with director Louis Leterrier's \"The Incredible Hulk\" with Edward Norton as the eponymous character. This adventure surpassed \"Hulk,\" but remained half-baked. Unfortunately, actor Edward Norton feuded with the studio over the film's interpretation of the material. Happily, for Hulk, lightening strikes the third time. Mark Ruffalo looks ideal as Dr. Bruce Banner and Whedon literally has remade the Hulk in Ruffalo's own image. Hawkeye and The Black Widow aren't exactly in the same league with luminaries like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, or Hulk. These two are conventional agents of SHIELD with special skill sets. Neither, however, possesses Herculean prowess. Lastly, ubiquitous Agent Phil Coulson hasn't changed an iota. Like Nick Fury, Coulson has appeared in most of the films. More than any other character, Coulson makes the greatest impression in \"The Avengers\" when Loki throws down the gauntlet.There are two kinds of super hero movies. First, you have the brawny, exciting sagas, with sparkling verbal repartee, like \"Iron Man\" and \"Captain America,\" that are lightweight and exhilarating. Second, like \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight,\" you have those that are dark, literate, complicated, and rely as much as possible on realism. \"The Avengers\" belongs to the first category, and Whedon's opus ranks as one of the best. The action never sacrifices its momentum for expository information about any of the heroes. Iron Man has lost none of his quirky, anti-heroic personality. Captain America is still as straight as one of Hawkeye's arrows. Hulk acquires a mystique lacking in prior incarnations, and Thor becomes the hammer wielding equivalent of an intergalactic lawman. Again, Loki's machinations keep thing interesting. \"The Avengers\" is the kind of movie where you need to stick around even as the end credits roll to learn more about the villains and the heroes.",

It's THE AVENGERS people! :D Like a super-rock group combined for a world tour of well avenging! Loads of action thanks to Joss Whedon's sharp and sharply funny screenplay with Zak Penn, and helming the megaton endeavor with aplomb and nervy verve and thankfully a lot of well sprinkled humor with one-liners, put-downs and more sight gags not seen since the heyday of ZAZ (Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker of AIRPLANE! fame for the uninitiated).

    "reviewBody": "Many times a movie is so anticipated with so much buzz surrounding it audiences can't help but be disappointed on some level. Joss Whedon's \" Marvel's The Avengers \" had a lot to prove as it hit theaters at midnight on May 4. When building up a movie through five separate ones over a span of five years, you better be able to deliver. I'm happy to say cast and crew delivered big time.\"Marvel's The Avenger\" is probably one of the best superhero films ever made. That's a lot coming from me because I'm a DC Comics guy. I don't even read Marvel or keep up with the Universe. I recommend spending the extra money to see the movie in IMAX 3D for the complete experience. If you're a fan of the Hulk, prepare yourself to see him as you never have before in a live-action film.",

    "reviewBody": "I don't care that much about special effects or budget but the story and logic and fun is most important for any movie. This movie failed in many areas esp you need brain damage to accept the story. To put Hulk into a flying ship is just some example how fail the story is. Well to put Hulk into enemy flying ship is somewhat clever but put it into own flying ship WTF? Problem with all these superhero movies is that by definition no hero can die so actually you already know the end of the movie before it start. Ironman put off his armor 50% of the movie despite they are permanent in war and always contact with enemy. The movie was very slow too as it took about 100min to introduce all the \"new\" characters and give them some fake glue to form a team. When the enemy finally arrived which was about 5min before the end of the movie I didn't even see how the high advanced enemy can win over the street NY policemen with hand pistols. For strange reason the us army didn't join the fight so NY policemen with some heroes did the job alone. Loki as the only villain in that movie acted like a joke and fitted seamless into that crap movie. I still don't get it how can you put a super hero as Loki with near unlimited god powers into a \"glas cage\" and call that secure.",

    "reviewTitle": "Superhero Collage",
    "reviewBody": "Joss Whedon is a nerd treasure, after having earned his geek street cred with some of the most iconic TV shows and characters around. My favourite of his creations remains \"Firefly\", an all-around extraordinary show, at the same time my deep dislike for Fox after the cancellation of said show, also remains intact. It was the popularity of the show and the loyalty of the fans which brought Joss Whedon back with his fond and well deserved closing act (?) to the Firefly saga, in the form of the excellent but oft overlooked \"Serenity\". It was through directing \"Serenity\" that Joss Whedon showed that he can easily and comfortably venture beyond TV land and into feature films. His colleague JJ Abrahms (and his gang) also made that same successful leap.It thus came as no great surprise that \"The Avengers\" turned out to be such a fun ride, not to mention an insanely profitable one. It speaks to the vision and talent of the man who helmed the project, and what that imagination and talent can do when given the appropriate resources.Whedon managed to take the several superhero movies which served as interconnected instalments or prequels of sorts to this movie, \"Iron Man\" 1 and 2, \"The Incredible Hulk\" \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" and \"Thor\", and successfully and quite masterfully bring them all under the umbrella of \"The Avengers\", a fitting conclusion (though I'm sure based on the end-credits that a sequel is in the works) to this whole Marvel Universe enterprise.I am not as floored with the movie as the audiences apparently are, but given the number of actors and characters populating the screen, Whedon did an admirable job letting them all share the spotlight, while keeping the story rolling. He was able to imbue the story with enough substance and gravitas so as to prevent the movie from becoming just another unremarkable, brainless, big-budged popcorn dud (yeah, yeah \"John Carter\" and \"Battleship\" you're what I had in mind) \"The Avengers\" does not come close in quality to the quite unfairly overlooked \"X-Men: First Class\" (or any of Nolan's Batman flicks), but for what it was meant to be, a summertime season opener, it more than achieved its purpose (and probably set the standard, at least money-wise, too high and potentially out of reach for the other big-budget releases of the summer).If nothing else, I can say I had fun watching \"The Avengers\", but with Joss Whedon at the wheel you do get something extra in terms of quality over quantity.Bravo Whedon! I'm looking forward to you spreading your wings even further.",

    "reviewBody": "Honestly, I had heard so many people say this was going to be \"great\". I think I even read some good reviews by reputable critics. And I am left wondering. DID WE SEE THE SAME MOVIE????????? Wow – what a total load of crap. And I thought that \"Battleship\" was going to be lemon of the year. Honestly, \"Battleship\" was better than \"The Avengers\". Basically it was a sequel to Thor, which was crap and nobody saw.The script was shocking, the acting appalling. Even the real actors had a hard time delivering their crappy lines. Thor especially was dreadful – WTF with the weird English accent? He's a terrible actor so I didn't expect much – but I'd rather his foul Australian accent than whatever he was trying to do in this movie. Scarlet's character was also bad. She's not a bad actress but her character was terrible (what, exactly, was her superpower supposed to be anyway??)The whole thing was corny, cheesy and completely over the top – a flying aircraft carrier??? WTF?? By the end of the film you didn't care what happened - you just needed it to end. If this movie represents what the majority of people think of as \"good filmmaking\", then surely as a species we are doomed. Appealing to the lowest of the lowest common denominators.The best part was seeing the trailers (in 3D) of \"Dark Knight\" and \"Prometheus\". Seriously.",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing, and I will break down why",
    "reviewBody": "When the Tesseract suddenly activates itself, it briefly opens a portal. A small one, but nonetheless it allows Loki(who uses his illusions well) to pass through... and he now has a sceptre that allows him to take over people by touch. He escapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy, and with the threat of it being used to allow an invasion of Earth by the alien force the Chitari, what can Fury do other than... Assemble Avengers. This is an excellent piece, that lives up to the hype. It will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike. A lot of people will be exclaiming that, so I will try to back it up instead of just fawning over this(and believe me, I could go 1000 words just doing that). It follows up on all... no, *all*... of the threads set up in the five films that came before(and yes, it will really help to have watched all of them before this... then again, if you have any interest in this, you probably already have). Nothing is abandoned or ignored. The sheer planning that went into this... and this is still full of fantastic surprises. And for all the development(all of that in this is highly credible, by the way) of characters, powers and conflicts(and this takes the ball and runs with it, and adds the interpersonal relationships of these people who have not shared a screen before now, who are rather different people) that precedes this, there is a solid amount of it in this, as well. All six(and no, you can't tell that two of them, one of them especially, haven't gotten much screen time before this) members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introduction(actually, that goes for Nick and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, both very cool, as well), a strong heroic act that only they could have accomplished, *and*... a situation of immense peril(not to mention that they(and we) are treated to one continuous tracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent, one by one, once they've grown into a team, working together... no, they don't start out like that, and yes, there is indeed infighting early on, and yes, we get every one-on-one that anyone wants, and it is glorious... the trailer is literally just the preview). All of them have something to do(and they are recruited gradually, no one overshadowing anyone else... and somehow, this gets all the aspects that make them work individually, in their own movies, somehow, without getting tonal schizophrenia), some reason to be in this, and the threat(Hiddleston is friggin' intimidating) is grand enough that we need all of them, and for them to band together. Tony has to prove that he is selfless, that he doesn't just fix his own mistakes(and he brings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks, that come out to putting a severe dent in the enemies). Steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him, and bring them all into one, effective unit(and he is the great leader that is required, one that you yourself would follow, and, indeed, a Super Soldier(a title he earns)). Thor(who brings godlike might, and a Shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy) and Natasha(who is the real brains of the operation, and can manipulate the foe... they use one of her qualities well, that being her apparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not) are dealing with a lot of guilt, on account of it being an Asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her... dark past as a spy who'd take on missions for or against anyone, respectively. Clint(who brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy to good use) has his own to make amends for(you'll see...). Bruce(who comes with the sheer destructive weight of his alter ego) is brought on for his expertise on the subject of Gamma radiation(he can help find the vital cube), and... I don't need to spell out what he feels bad about, do I? He does seem to have gotten the Hulk under control... or has he? This builds up the transformation, and he remains a danger. He's the only one to have another person attached to it than played it last, and while I had no problem with Norton(who I love in other stuff... in that, he didn't do all he could with it, though), this part is Ruffalo's. There is this very terrifying aspect to him, he could metamorphose and cause significant damage and pain... and he plays it like you'd expect him to be, very non-confrontational and anxious, yet smart and confident in his field. All of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind, saving countless people. There are not many supporting roles(Phil Coulson does return, and he is enjoyable, with a fandom of Cap; there's also a female agent named Hill, who kicks ass... in fact, every woman in this is hot, independent and not objectified... kudos for that, along with the rest, Whedon), with focus placed where it should be, on the ensemble cast. Is it necessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spot-on? You've already seen Chris, Robert and Liam do incredible, and they do so here, too. Everyone does. The writing is phenomenal. I am struggling to find one line of dialog(with Iron Man-like wit and banter) that isn't quotable, sharp and well-delivered. The action is plentiful, has distinct stages to it(none of that unaimed, mindless crap), culminating in a truly massive climax, and somehow never running out of steam or exhausting the audience. This keeps to a pitch perfect pace, and at nearly two and a half hours, there is nothing tedious or rushed. The FX? Breathtaking. 3D? Used right(only little distinctly moves towards/points at you). I recommend this to everyone who is considering it. 10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "A Big Super Hero Fan Setup",
    "reviewBody": "This movie was simply 6 letter's in 1 word, \"Boring\". Why you may ask? Well, it's best to start from the beginning. I was expecting a great movie featuring several different superhero in 1 screen, I was so hyped that I got as many friends as I can to see it but some couldn't go so I only invited a few. God the movie was so hyped that there was a huge line and I mean huge and all of those people were gonna go see the same film that I was gonna see. So once I walked in and waited for almost 20 minutes for the movie to start, that is when the big disappointment began. Such a boring introduction and lame character revilement. No creativity, no second thought, no built up, nothing. Feels more like an introduction to Jersey Shore and Transformers than an actual Marvel Film. But I got to admit, the begging scene where Thor's brother appears reminds me of halo (atleast the first one) so that's pretty cool but too bad the scene itself sucked no matter what. The other negatives that made this film a disappointment is the lack of any real character imitations. Thor brother was the prime example of this along with the childish predictable jokes you hear from them. The acting and written for Thor's brother was pathetic and pointless that without he's mighty powers he's nothing but a wimp or the actor himself was just a wimp from the beginning. He looks to be about 50 years old and doesn't resemble any appears of Thor what's so ever, all they do is just put on the costume and that's it. So what about the clichéd jokes I mentioned? Well, there stupid, childish, out of place for a movie that is suppose to be quality entertainment (then again it was terrible and nothing new) and once you hear the first joke, you will automatically know that all the jokes will be the same kind of thing threw out the whole movie. I will admit that I did laugh at some moments but it struck me to be unpleasant and very lazy for a movie like this or any other. In fact, I was so bored and unpleased that I wanted to leave right when black widow appears cause it was so boring. But I didn't cause I wouldn't want to hurt my friends's feeling's that I invited them to a movie and wanted to leave once we began watching it. So I stayed and watched the rest of the movie. It took about half of the movie just so all of heroes can appear and an interesting note I might add is that Edward Norton who played as Bruce Banner in the incredible hulk (2008) was replaced when I was expecting him to be in it. So I was disappointed with that cause he was great as Bruce Banner. The ending climates with the avengers and Thor's Brother was lame as well. Sure some of the action is cool but some other action scence suck and it used special/sound effects from transformers and that sucks. When I think of action from the avengers I would predict it to be Dragon Ball Z without energy waves or teleportation. But no it just felt dull. So, what I did I really think of the movie overall? Well, to put it short and bluntly this is what I said in my mind when the movie ended \"THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!! WHAT A SETUP FROM MARVEL TO DISGRACE SUCH HEROES THAT WERE GOOD TILL THIS MOVIE CAME OUT! MARVEL MUST OF KNEW THAT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MARVEL FANBOYS WERE GONNA GO SEE THIS MOVIE CAUSE IT HAD THEIR FAVORITE HEROES IN ONE BIG SCREEN! NOT A SECOND THOUGHT ON HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS WHO'S IN IT?! Wow, what a waste of money and time I wasted on such a worthless movie like this. FIRST THEY RUINED SPIDERMAN AND NOW THIS?! WHAT A SETUP!.\" That's how I really felt like when I finished watching this movie. And you want to know what was the saddest part about it is?! A bunch of people said it was amazing and the best movie of the year! B******! Worst movie of the year you mean! And worst super hero movie I've ever seen in general. I recommend you all take my advice and don't waste your time on such dread cause it's not worth it. Don't Listen to what to the people who liked this movie cause they're only saying it cause there just so depended on Marvel that they think anything with their superhero will be good. At this point and on I don't really like Marvel at all anymore. The Avengers ruined it for me. Time to official move on to DC like everyone else would do. And the ones who haven't, wake up and see reality that your pointless Marvel Heroes are Zeros. My god this movie was so Bad when I think about it I feel embarrassed that I sat down and really watched the whole movie and didn't leave right when I felt like going to sleep like everyone else would. But I give this movie a 3/10 just because the beginning reminded me of Halo. But besides that the movie itself was so incredible boring and very unoriginal, don't forget it was predictable too. In fact when I was watching half of the movie I completely forget what the plot was really about. Another thing is that the movie feels more like a sequel to Thor than actual teamed up superhero movie. So, don't see The Avengers but go watch The Dark Knight Rises instead. That was a far better movie than The Avengers. Thanks for reading and I hope you take my advice. Good Bye, Your gonna need it.",

    "reviewTitle": "A cinematic Marvel in more ways than one",
    "reviewBody": "When the first Iron Man film came out, the studios behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe were embarking on something truly unprecedented in modern cinema. Iron Man was a relatively under-promoted movie with trailers that showed barely the surface of what to expect. I went to the midnight screening of the movie with a number of friends as a social outing, while they were the ones who were truly Marvel comics fanatics. By the end, I was absolutely blown away by the strength of the movie in both its action and gravitas. And after the credits, when Nick Fury arrived played by Samuel L. Jackson to announce \"The Avengers Initiative\", I was both excited and skeptical.Although I wasn't an avid comic book fan at the time, most people my age knew who the Avengers were - the \"World's Mightiest Heroes\", comprising such characters which would be almost ludicrous to depict on screen. In this day and age, who would take a movie about Captain America seriously? Or Thor, who I knew of primarily as a chief Norse god and not a superhero? And yet, one by one, each of the movies blew away all my preconceptions and expectations.The Avengers, the result of four years of meticulous buildup and hard work, does not disappoint. I am by no means a Joss Whedon fanboy, but you could see his work ingrained in the dialogue, the scripting, and the loving attention paid to a universe that he, as a comic book fan, clearly cares about. I remained skeptical all the way until I was physically sitting in the theater that this could be anything but an action orgy, yet through the most unlikely situations, they gave the film a heart.The premise is surprisingly simple - Loki, Thor's brother from his film, is preparing to invade the Earth with the help of an unknown benefactor and an army called the Chitauri (who are in fact the Ultimate Marvel version of the notorious Skrull - minus the shapeshifting ability) while taking advantage of the artifact known as the Tesseract (which the fans of the comics would recognize as the Cosmic Cube). SHIELD's Nick Fury, recognizing the threat, tries to bring the team together with Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and the out-of-time Captain America, while consulting Dr. Bruce Banner, whose angry side has been kept under control for some time, to help find the Tesseract. The initial interaction between them is, as expected, not a cordial one, though you do see the beginnings of some deep friendships beginning, including one between Stark and Banner - evidently brought together by a penchant for genius. While there are numerous shorter action sequences stringing the film together with character setpieces, the finale of the movie culminates in one of the most brilliantly shot 30-40 minute action sequences I've ever seen. The third Transformers movie attempted something similar, and failed at it, where this truly succeeded.A few things really stand out in the movie. The first is the evolution of Tony Stark's character. In previous movies the main thing that had really been explored were (a) his ego and (b) his quest for redemption; as Rogers puts it, however, he seems to only fight for himself and is \"all about style\". Yet, in this film, he manages to portray not only a semblance of heroism, but participates in one of probably the most heroic acts depicted so far in a superhero film. His relationship with Dr. Banner manages to underscore just how strong his character has become - where the other team see Banner as a ticking \"time bomb\", as he aptly puts at one point, Stark believes that not only did the Hulk save Banner's life, it is something of his nature to be embraced and taken control of instead of feared. And ultimately, the faith he shows in him proves to be right.Another strong element of the film, as in most Joss Whedon productions, is the uplifting of a strong female character, namely Black Widow. Natasha Romanoff had a bit part in the second Iron Man film, but wasn't the real focus of the film nor was she fully explored as a character. This film provides a strong focus into her psyche as a master assassin and highlights her relationship with Hawkeye, the master marksman. She's surprisingly one of the film's most inscrutable characters, showing only enough emotion as she needs, but being capable of great loyalty, compassion, and heroism. Despite her and Clint Barton being the two \"non-superheroes\" on the team, they provide an absolutely integral part of the team; their role is irreplaceable on the team and they kick as much butt as the rest of the hyper-powered team members. At no point in the movie did I feel like any one super hero was used to prop up the others like a crutch.And finally, without a doubt, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of both Bruce Banner and the Hulk is probably one of the best ever to hit the screen. Previous movies had touched on the strength of the Hulk and his potential for limitless strength while highlighting Banner's genius and compassionate nature, but it has never been done quite so well. He steals the movie, ultimately surpassing all expectations against all the odds. He grows rapidly (both literally and figuratively) throughout the movie, gaining a new sort of confidence. Before the film I wasn't a huge fan of the Hulk, but after-wards, I have infinitely more respect for the character - mixed in with a touch of respectful fear.This movie is definitely worth watching in theaters, on the big screen. The experience is 100% worth it. All I can say is, The Dark Knight Rises has a lot to live up to if it hopes to do anywhere near as well as this monster of a film.",

    "reviewBody": "The Marvel comic book based films have made millions at the box office, and everybody must have been thrilled with a number of the best superheroes of the series being put together in the same film, and presuming you have seen the previous films with them it has been building up to this. Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated, opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, recruiting some of the world's most powerful and special heroes, starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of \"The Other Guy\", while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit, and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation, and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri, led by The Other (Alexis Denisof), and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube, showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him, he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives, also transported from Asgard, and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way, and this turns into a fight between him, Iron Man and Captain America, but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell, designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns, and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator, and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico, when Thor was previously on Earth, and that the attack makes Earth an easy target, and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack, and as the argument continues Loki's mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship, the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again, while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside, and fighting with Barton, Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship, Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground, and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together, work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities, and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan, and it is up to Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end, after Dr. Selvig is revived, so much explosive fighting, and a prevented missile blowing up in space, Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard, the Avengers go their separate ways, until a new threat to the world emerges, and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master, who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos. Also starring Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Paul Bettany as Jarvis, Sudden Death's Powers Boothe as World Security Council, Jenny Agutter as World Security Council, Harry Dean Stanton as Security Guard, Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Hulk and a cameo by Stan Lee. The cast are all fantastic, Downey Jr. with all the quips, Evans as the sensible fighter, Ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper, Hemsworth as the arrogant warrior, Johansson as the confident female, and Jackson as the intelligent controller. It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series, and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, the story and scripting are very well made, and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks, invading creatures, and constant explosions, this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years, a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!",

    "reviewTitle": "Plot, Costume, and Theme Review",
    "reviewBody": "Knowing a little bit about comic books, and knowing some about Avengers Assemble it made this film The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, even more enjoyable for me.When Earth comes under attack by Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in his pursuit to get the Tesseract, it is up to S.H.I.E.L.D. to pull start up The Avengers. After a small town is almost completely destroyed by Thor on a previous visit to Earth S.H.I.E.L.D. decided that they needed something that could take on anything that was not from \"this world\". So when Nick Fury calls on some of the biggest heroes Earth has ever met: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarelett Johansson), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), and of course Thor (Chris Hemsworth).The theme of this movie in my opinion would be Man vs. Man. This is because throughout the entire film there is some sort of conflict going on. The first and main conflict that appears is Loki attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. takes control of Hawkeye and Dr. Selvig in order to steal the Tesseract and use it for his own purposes. A second conflict that appears in the film is between Thor and Loki. When Thor still considers them brothers Loki retaliates and says that he is not really his brother and that he should still be the \"true\" ruler of Asgard.With the costumes that have been chosen for this film it helps to create the aspect of the heroes being more than a normal human. Even with Hawkeye and Black Widow, Black Widow had been trained pretty much from birth to become a killer, and Hawkeye has advance skills in marksmanship. With Thor's costume he is wearing something that helps to prove that he is not from Earth and from another world. Now for Iron Man, he made his own super suit that could do almost anything, which includes keeping him safe from being torn up from the roaders on the ship that S.H.I.E.L.D. was functioning from after an attack from Loki and his minions.Finally, in the final attack with Loki and The Avengers, Thor takes Loki back to Asgard to deal with his faults there where the intention is for him to be properly punished.This is a must see film especially if you are a comic book junkie!",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply Incredible!",
    "reviewBody": "Loki is looking to unleash hell down on earth and make people bow at his feet. Nick Fury is forced to assemble the world's greatest superheroes, in hopes of saving everyone. The Avengers must put their egos aside to make everything right again and stop Loki. I'm hoping to see Age of Ultron later this week. In preparation for it, and to get myself more pumped, I decided to watch The Avengers again for the fourth time. This movie has almost everything you can possibly imagine. Ever wanted to see Thor face off against The Incredible Hulk? How about Thor fighting Iron Man? You'll get that here and more. If you're not fond of some of the superheroes in this movie, there is plenty of others to choose from. It really is a Marvel fan's wet dream. It's one thing to make great action, it's another to combine that great action with near-flawless storytelling. Joss Whedon manages to pull this off. This must have been an incredibly hard script to write! Whedon manages to deal with the pressure to give us a thoughtful script. I loved how the first 30 minutes or so focuses on introducing each character. I thought it was really neat how they delved into what everybody was going through at the time. The action scenes may take your breath away. I'm what you call an adrenaline junkie. I've seen tons of action movies, but there aren't many that make my jaw drop like this one. The last 40 minutes or so are filled with mind blowing action. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe. The performances are excellent. These superheros may have incredible abilities, but they have flaws. The character development was superb. Robert Downey is awesome as Iron Man. His obnoxious behavior tests my patience, but he is perfect for Iron Man. Captain America isn't my favorite by any means. Chris Evans is great at playing him though. He even manages to make him somewhat likable! Chris Hemsworth is tremendous as Thor. Mark Ruffalo isn't the best Hulk, but he does a really good job nonetheless. Scarlett Johansson was my favorite! She has a lot of depth to her character. Her checkered past, and reluctance to be a heroine made her character all the more interesting. She also has some great fight scenes. Wait until you see the stunts when she's tied up in a chair. Tom Hiddleston is amazing as Loki. He is so manipulative, smarmy, and I couldn't stand him. If you hated Loki in Thor, you'll hate him even more here. What a job! Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of coolness. Jeremy Renner is very good as Hawkeye. I wish they'd have delved into his struggle a bit more, but I won't carp too much. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Skarsgard, Paltrow, all do what they have to do well. This movie is the closest thing to perfection. I can't see Marvel topping this. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it never fails to blow me away. I'm so pumped for Age of Ultron10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers, a movie about six heroes and yet the villain is the most interesting character in it.",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers,the story of a group of super-powered people (well some of them anyway) who are recruited by a secret agency to stop a threat that apparently one hero alone can't fight. Such lies.Captain America,(Chris Evans)- the so called leader of the avengers. A nice person to the point of garystudom. He is one of the most boring characters in the movie. I watched the avengers for the first time a few months ago on Netflix, and Cap's origin movie was on there as well, and I tried to watch it but only got to the 30 minute mark and shut it off. I was bored to proverbial tears. I don't get the appeal. For me he has no presence and is as forgettable and boring as Hawkeye and Black Widow.Ironman,(RDJ)- the real leader in my opinion. He seems to be the focus for most of the important plot points, and he is the one who untimely saves New-York. He just has a presence that the rest of them lacked. Where the heroes were concerned the movie was more like Ironman featuring the Avengers and I actually didn't have problem with that.Out of them all I loved his costume the most, and seeing him here has made me want to go out and see his origin movie and sequels.Thor (Chris Hemsworth)- Thor is decent by himself, but the interest level really comes in when he's playing against Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hemsworth and Hiddleston play well off each other. They have great chemistry and their love/hate brother dynamic is always fascinating to watch. This is a shame that this was barely touched on in Thor's own movie. Since to me the family dynamic is the meat of their stories. I loved watching their scenes in this movie (the little that we got to see of it) where we get to witness them bounce their dialogue and emotions off each other.Thor as a character shines better when he is on his own planet. Or pretty much any planet not named Earth. It's like when he's on ours it nearly sucks out everything interesting about him. Hawkeye( Jeremy Renner) and Black-Widow(Scarlett Johansson )- Two completely human characters fighting alongside super- powered people. Yea, really don't get that. They were wallpaper for me just like Captain America. When they were on screen it's like they were barely registering. I should not have a continuous question mark in my brain when it comes to a character.Bruce Banner/The Hulk(MarkRuffalo)- I have never seen the hulk movies (apparently there are a fair few) or the TV show. My first foray into this character was in this movie. He is nervous and twitchy, but generally a nice person and I think Ruffalo pulled that off nicely.Then he turns into the Hulk. I didn't like the Hulk. He's too godlike for one thing. Same problem I have with Thor and his kind. It takes the emotional stakes out of the character if it's pretty impossible for them to die. He also acts like an animal. Also not a fan of obvious CGI characters (huge green ones at that) being mains and running around with actual real people. It's very jarring in a bad way. I also don't think a full-blown movie works for him. His character works better in an ensemble or even better not part of the cast at all. As for the Bruce part of him well we already have a genius level scientist. Don't really need two. Overall I didn't enjoy the hulk and wanted him off my screen.Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - the main villain who pretty much took over the movie by his first scene on down. Like in his co-origin movie 'Thor' he is a true scene stealer. I loved watching him. Hiddleston is a treasure to watch act this character out. If the academy wasn't such stuck- ups about fantasy/sci-fi movies I truly think he deserved an Oscar for his portrayal in this and the first 'Thor' movie. His acting for Loki is just brilliant.However, no amount of scene stealing acting is going to erase that Whedon pretty much destroyed his overall character. He went from a sympathetic villain in 'Thor' to a complete monster punch line in this one. The tone of this movie wasn't serious enough in the first place with Whedon thinking he had to make everyone be a walking comedian, but I will never understand the logic of making your villain be the silliest thing in the movie.Sadly that is exactly what Whedon did. Loki was a pathetic villain.He took a great character and made him into a joke. The last straw though was not the constant beat downs and jokes at his expense, but an encounter with one of the avengers toward the end of the movie. Loki as a villain had officially went into ludicrous territory at that point. However, what saved him as a character for me was no matter how silly his dialogue sounded at points, or how many times he kissed pavement, or just how overall ridiculous he was as a villain, Hiddleston acted his butt off as Loki. I couldn't take my eyes off the character. All I wish is that Loki from now on stays in the 'Thor' movies and that Joss Whedon doesn't get to touch the character ever again.In summary the movie's tone was to comedic. It was like whedon was writing for the next bada bing instead of great emotional character moments. The dialogue was more cheesy and cliché then not.The CGI looked dated.There was no real emotional punch. I just didn't care if they lived or died. Although It wasn't like they were in any real danger of that happening in the first place since the movie overall lacked believable tension,and the villain was well acted but really pathetic as one.",

    "reviewBody": "I have never reviewed anything here on IMDb but after watching the Avengers for the second time I just felt the need to say something. Very well, after watching the Avengers in the cinema you don't reflect very much of the bad things, it's all special effects and 3D stuff going on. But after watching this alone at home, I just felt it's not that good. The story is cliché as many has mentioned, but I felt that there are a few things that are unclear.I just can't figure out how strong are the asgardians, they are supposedly demi-gods. Still the hulk threw Loki around like nothing, I just felt that scene was unnecessary. I don't want the bad-guy to look so crappy. I just couldn't take Loki seriously he got tossed around a lot. Don't get me wrong I enjoy some of the humor added to this film, it's just sometimes it's not timed right it just seems wrong to me.The most annoying part about The Avengers is that the Bad Guys didn't stand a chance. And I didn't like Loki for being a bad guy again.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie",
    "reviewBody": "I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like \"What are they, kidding?\", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the \"Classy Villain that Gotham needs\", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's \"White Knight\" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "Best superhero movie of all time",
    "reviewBody": "I think that I could wax lyrical but this movie all day. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish.This is the Batman trilogy's second outing. It's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn't follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: \"this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\". The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I'll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do I still think you should see this movie. It is just great.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made",
    "reviewBody": "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film \"Batman Begins,\" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for Smoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!",

    "reviewTitle": "The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie",
    "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman at his best and beyond",
    "reviewBody": "Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"I think you and I are destined to do this forever.\"",
    "reviewBody": "So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping \"The Dark Knight\". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns\" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's \"Batman\", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in \"No Country For Old Men\". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"There Will Be Blood\", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.",
    "reviewBody": "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.",

    "reviewTitle": "Perfect balance between action and drama with an unforgettable villain",
    "reviewBody": "Although I don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to IMDb, I do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is NOT a superhero movie. Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in \"Alias Nick Beal\" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including \"two cops\". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster.",

    "reviewTitle": "Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait",
    "reviewBody": "I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!",

I don't care how much hate it gets by all the FiLm SuPeRiOrS, this is my best film.Now that we've got that out of the way, I just gotta say: WOW. This thing is insane. I first watched this back when I had no knowledge of film and only watched Marvel/Star Wars/Disney movies, and I can confidently say that this was one of the main films that sparked my interest in the aspect of filmmaking. This was also the second (after Batman Begins obv) Christopher Nolan movie that I watched, and he is now my favorite director. Ik he gets mad hate by (once again) FiLm SuPeRiOrS, but idgaf. I'm a 16 year old boy, ofc I'm gonna like this dude.Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker may be my favorite acting performance ever. The only two performances I can pick out that could possibly be better than it is Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. He gets it perfectly, I definitely like it more than Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Everything abt it, his charisma, his voice, his subtle facial expressions and movements (like the lick of the lips) is perfect. His motives are perfectly explained and very realistic in my opinion, it's gotta one of if not my favorite characters in any piece of fiction ever.This movie is absolutely jam-packed with the best action scenes ever put on film. The truck flip/hit me scene is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Batman in this movie is also the single best adaptation of Batman ever put on film. He's got the best suit, the best actor, the best Bruce Wayne, the best everything. Even Michael Caines Alfred is amazing. They got absolutely everything right. This movie gave me a new love for Batman that I never knew I had (since I was a massive marvel fan).This movie constantly gave me chills. It made me feel so many emotions: suspense, shock, happiness, sadness, and much more. There are some amazing suspense movies that I've seen that have not nearly given off as much suspense as that boat explosion scene at the end. Speaking of the end, this is one of the best movie endings I've ever seen. The Joker actually won in the end, he corrupted Batman and made the city lose lots of hope by having Harvey Dent killed. On a side note, Aaron Eckhart's performance was also phenomenal.And that beginning. This is my favorite movie opening ever. It definitely isn't my favorite movie ending ever, but I can 100% say this is my favorite opening. The heist, the joker reveal, the vibe, everything is perfectly executed.I could go on and on abt how every scene on this movie either amazed me or made its way onto my top scenes ever list, but the review would be too long. This movie deserves all the hype it gets, the people that don't like it are usually just trying to be \"different\" (or its just not their thing idfk). When I'm watching films similar to this, I always find myself comparing it to this film. No movie will ever capture the PERFECT vibe this one captures. I don't know what it is, it's just so insanely classic rich late 2000s movie night. Idk how else to explain it, but you know what I mean. Anyways yeah, this is my favorite movie ever, and I don't see anything overtaking it anytime soon (or ever).",

    "reviewTitle": "Actually a really good movie",
    "reviewBody": "Now that I've watched The Dark Knight, I think I understand why Batman is DC's single most popular \"hero\". I put hero in quotations because the movie explained it very well, Batman is no proper hero, he will go down to the sewers if that means he gets to make the city just a bit safer, which makes him stand out within this genre.Enough about Batman, this movie is set rather early within Batman's timeline. Early enough for Batman to be a well known figure, but not early enough for the villains to catch up to his firepower.This is no average hero movie, in fact, it is no children's her movie, not only because of its dark undertones, which are very present and best embodied by the Joker's character, but also because the story is not as simple as a hero saving the day. Batman was struggling, Batman was powerless, Batman lost more than he gained and Batman achieved only a very temporary victory.The main contributions of the Dark Knight series were the replacement of the villain fodder by its two main antagonists, the Joker and Harvey Dent, or Two Face for those more aware of DC lore, although, the latter was merely created.As for the Joker himself, I really do like his character, which is, if memory serves me right, the model upon which the modern Joker is inspired from. A well deserved title. I really like this stance on the Joker, forsaking the clown aspect, and the laughs he is supposed to bring (to the more twisted ones of us that is) and instead showing a broken man, eager to make the city to his image, a bundle of chaos, where people are bound by no laws other than the one which they dictate.Character dynamic was good. It was fun seeing the characters evolve in reaction to the Joker causing mayhem in the city.Not much to point out for flaws, although I did get the feeling 2:30 hours is really long. And speaking about it, the movie should have been split in half rather than stitching up 2 related, yet different stories.Allow me to explain myself, the movie was clearly split in 2 parts which, looking back on it, was definitely on purpose, to draw a comparison between the \"good\" Harvey Dent, who strives for a better Gotham, rid of its criminality and the \"bad\" Harvey Dent who, struck by grief and disillusioned with any justice who would cause harm to one of its most fervent defenders cut his own path, away from the Joker and motivated by vengeance disguised as justice.The cutting off point was, of course, Harvey Dent and that one girl, who served as a plot device and some sort of romantic interest for Bruce and Harvey (no dig on that, although it could have been slightly less blatant) were put in that timed bomb by Joker, and ended up getting one of them killed and the other permanently scarred.Basically, what I'm saying is that they abandoned a more digestible product to add this one layer of depth to the movie, which, as I think about what I write was maybe a better choice, as it made the movie that little bit better.Overall, really good, kinda dark, not something to show a child, not only because it's dark, but also because while not amazingly deep, is still something that requires an adult mind to fully enjoy.",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again.",

    "reviewTitle": "Undescribable Perfection",
    "reviewBody": "Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like \"Batman Begins\" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be \"152 minutes of pure awesomeness.\" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing \"Batman Begins\" will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.",

    "reviewTitle": "Too many fans seem to be blown away",
    "reviewBody": "Many commenters said they were \"blown away,\" so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe I'm beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I'm not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasn't (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in \"unexpecteds\" is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. I'm not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but can't agree with so many who rate this film at the top.It's good and entertaining -- but too long. It's not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I don't mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom don't have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won't be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment.",

    "reviewTitle": "Lives up to the hype",
    "reviewBody": "This, the second of director Cristopher Nolan's Batman trilogy opens with a bank robbery; the robbers are all wearing clown masks and when each has finished his part of the job he is killed by one of his colleagues. When only one is left he removes his mask to reveal a disturbing face; he is wearing predominantly white make up with black around his eyes and a disturbing red smile he is The Joker and clearly he is insane. It turns out the money he stole belonged to the mob and they are worried about losing the rest; either to The Joker or to the forces of law and order. Leading the campaign against crime in Gotham is a new white knight; DA Harvey Dent; a man who intends to take down the criminals by using the system rather than hiding behind a mask. Soon Dent, Lt. Gordon and Batman are after The Joker; and he in turn is after them and those they love.I put off watching this for a long time fearing I'd be disappointed; surely no film could live up to the hype this one received It turned out I needn't have worried; this is a fantastic film. The returning cast members perform well but it is the new characters that really stand out. Heath Ledger certainly deserved his Oscar; his Joker is genuinely disturbing, Aaron Eckhart is great too in the roll of Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as his girlfriend, and Bruce Wayne's old friend Rachel. Those wanting action will be pleased as it rarely stops and is spectacular; this doesn't mean there is any sacrifice of good characterisation and plot though. There are some good surprises along the way as well as a degree of tragedy. If you think superhero films are for children you should be aware that there are plenty of disturbing and even brutal moments here which might disturb youngsters I was a little surprised that it got a UK '12' certificate; it is certainly a 'high 12'. Overall I'd say don't worry about the hype just sit back and enjoy an excellent action film that just happens to have a superhero as its main character.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nolan won't top this; his masterpiece",
    "reviewBody": "Preface: I have seen this film several times at varying development timepoints in my life. The attitude I initially had early on was that: 'this film is a masterpiece!' It excited me! Then, Nolan's other films came out (and suffice it to say, outside of Dunkirk, I am not a big fan). Then, upon researching, I discovered that this film is QUITE similar to Michael Mann's Heat (note, this combined with the fact that Interstellar is--tries to be--QUITE similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey makes me feel as if Nolan is excellent at copying auteurs of the past and marketing their works to his advantage). Then, I fell in love with Batman v Superman (check my review for that--ie a film that UNDERSTANDS Batman is a COMICBOOK character). Meshed altogether, without having seen the film in quite some time, I held the opinion that: 'The Dark Knight is pretentious garbage. It's a carbon copy of Heat that Nolan lazily dresses up with SOME costumes. Nolan sucks, ergo The Dark Knight sucks.' I have to be honest with myself, and convey the sentiment that I don't think Nolan is a fantastic filmmaker. He's clearly mild-tempered, which helps generate the illusion of intelligence in his films, but he thinks too highly of himself; his films suffer for it. Now, onto the reason I give this film 10/10!Review: From the opening gate (let's say within the first 20-30 minutes), Nolan presents a dystopia. A modern city in which the Leviathan (Thomas Hobbes--basically, law and order) is at stake (the presentation of these 'stakes' feel higher than any 'universe at stake' fiascos). The color palette (even the Joker's purportedly bright clothes) are subdued and darker to mirror the degradation happening in Gotham. Forgoing gratuity in terms of visuals (ie the opening bank scene is not truly violent despite multiple deaths), Nolan's pace is high as he keeps his scenes very tight; no meat on the bone here. Despite being a Nolan film, there is more emotion than I remembered. As the stakes are established, I emphasized with Harvey Dent, and I additionally emphasized with Gordon; Gordon is just an older Dent in some ways. Like Batman they want to restore the integrity of Gotham. And while these monumental stakes/characters are developed, there are some wicked action scenes (to note: Bank Heist; Introduction to Tumbler crashing through parking garage; the whole Lao extraction. Obviously, the later well known action sequences are really gnarly as well). It's certainly an intelligent crime/action film that values tone/minimalism over gratuity. And it WORKS in this case, as the CORE DRAMA (as previously stated) is the Leviathan. Note: Nolan (despite having somewhat of a villain vs hero battle at the end) does not indulge in traditional comic book climaxes--he is setting up the question: 'Will Gotham survive as an ordered society operating under the Law by the end?' As a result, while we don't get hyperkinetics, we get presentations of wicked tech that aren't presented Michael Bay style; it is what it is, and it works in this case. Additionally, the 'subdued' vibe of the film bolsters the evilness of the Joker. Honestly, the Joker killings remind me a lot of 'Saw,' and thinking through his scenes, the Joker feels more like a horror villain than a comic book villain. It's really mature, and--thus--really scary. However, the scene with dead copycat vigilante-brutally murdered and hanged outside the mayor's office-demonstrates Nolan's biggest strength and, simultaneous, weakness-he doesn't let moments simmer (why 42 min in, the film is so tight and tense). But then moments like this that could have been very dramatic and upsetting...he rushes through. Nolan doesn't care about gratuity, but as a result he misses out on a lot of emotion. Once again, it is what it is. This is Nolan's style. And, I have to accept it. It does work. We are briskly pulled along a ~2.5 hr film that doesn't feel that way because of how tight and tense the film in. Indeed, there are some potent emotional moments as well (death of Rachel, and Bruce's reaction). And while Nolan steals heavily from Michael Mann (the club scene with Maroni is too reminiscent of Collateral to me), he makes an original interpretation of Batman, that is not really Batman--funny. A crime film with some very memorable action sequences in which practical effects lend a certain reality to these sequences (eg destruction of Gotham General). A crime film through and through though (recall, Scorsese's Goodfellas--Joe Pesci's character asks Ray Liotta's 'What am I to you, a clown?'--crime films have always had WILD, OUTRAGEOUS personalities; Nolan just spruced up their costumes a tad here). Note the fundamentals of a film are: exciting kinetic visuals (the PRECISE reason this media form is called movie), and a moving soundtrack. Such visuals can be expressed through either an incredible color palette (eg MM Fury Road) or raw emotion (eg Nic Cage). The more pretentious a film becomes, the worse it gets (eg check Nolan's film Tenet-which is a complete missed opportunity). Other than Dunkirk, in this film, Nolan really does let himself go-even though, as I've stated-the film is very tight. I came in telling my friends this is an overrated film. It's not. It is not as fun as Batman v Superman, but it is a fantastic, well thought out, powerful moral battle between two larger than life personalities in a dark, corrupt city in which extremism was (seemingly) inevitable. Regarding the soundtrack, it's epic, cmon.On Nolan's understanding of the Joker and Batman: What I noticed about the interplay between Joker and Batman (which to Nolan's credit shows he understands the characters-despite his unwillingness to fully dip his toes into comicbook fantasticalness) is that in essence the entire drama existing between the characters is such: Joker is baiting Batman to either submit to the Law (which he knows Batman is wont to do-the corruption within Gotham is precisely the reason Bruce chooses vigilantism) or fully commit to criminality (even Gordon treats Batman as a supercop; super, but still a cop-shows Batman is treated without the disdain given to criminals; ie Joker hates the grayness of Batman's identity). The Joker escalates (check soundtrack for reference-not an original thought on my part to use that word) the bait increasingly throughout the film (in the form of increased terrorism) to induce Batman's submission to the Joker's will. What I find incredible is that (as Lucius notes) Batman does give in and commits to being a criminal; he even admits it to Gordon at the end-he's earned the distinction of criminal; he completely ignored the law (data invasion) to get to his selfish \"selfless\" goal (capture Joker). NOTE, importantly, once Batman chooses to break heavily into criminality with his data invasion and bootstrap sonar, toward the end of the film, Gordon FINALLY pulls a gun on Batman-he's transformed completely into a criminal. (brief interlude) I remember in Fincher's Se7en the original ending was supposed to cut with Mills shooting John Doe. However, WB forced Fincher to include the Hemingway scene. I think the endings to both Se7en and the Dark Knight are comparable-the ending of Batman going into the light is superfluous and detracts from the main message of the film (it should have ended with Bruce tossing the police dogs off of him, and getting shot by the police-armor protecting him though). In essence, Nolan executes a minimalist version of my 'violent fantasy' (if you will). But the ending is quite fulfilling regardless-Batman chose the life of criminality; he couldn't be Harvey Dent, and Harvey Dent was killed for not having the ability to be Batman. Despite all of Bruce's training, his strong mindset, his indominable ability to execute, Bruce was completely overwhelmed and belittled by this chaotic, violent perturbation (Joker). He completely humbled Batman in this film ('with just a few cans of oil and a couple of bullets'). It's a powerplay; which shows a genuine understanding of the characters. I don't give a bullocks about the 'philosophy' of the characters-you want philosophical enlightenment? Go read a book. The focus should be on the acting by both actors (stoic but wobbled when things don't go his way Bale versus the chaotic Ledger); their acting is the only thing that matters-and it's truly incredible (I think Nolan undervalues raw intensity in acting ie he gives actors less credit than he gives himself, but in this one, Nolan allowed the characters to really fly). In hindsight, I think my fascination with both Batman/Joker had undermined my ability to truly see the intricate character tension that Nolan created with these two characters. Whether it's similar to Neil McCauley and Lt. Vincent Hanna is irrelevant to me (now 😊 )",

    "reviewTitle": "He's not our hero; he's a silent guardian... a watchful protector... a dark knight.",
    "reviewBody": "Okay, okay, I get it... the last thing the world needed was even more discussion of The Dark Knight; after all, if you take into account both its critical acclaim and massive, unprecedented commercial success, with it being the first superhero movie to break the $1 billion mark worldwide, and the best reviewed superhero movie of all time on Rotten Tomatoes, it's probably THE most important, influential blockbuster of at least the past decade, if not even longer. Very few films have so throughly dominated the cultural zeitgeist for so long, not just in 2008, but ever since as well, but, still... even given all of this acknowledged, overblown hooplah, I still wanted, needed to revisit this movie regardless.Like so many other people, it made a huge impact on me upon its release, basically hypnotizing me in the theater and instantly becoming one of my favorite films, but despite that, I was still reluctant for a long time to watch it again it, since I was afraid it wouldn't hold up as well, and I wanted to preserve that great memory of the one (and only) time I saw it for as long as possible. Fortunately, I'm extremely happy to say that, despite a couple of minor flaws making themself more apparent this time around, The Dark Knight has held up absolutely superbly, remaining an incredibly ambitious, audacious effort from Christopher Nolan, and cementing its status as not only my #1 superhero movie, but also one of my favorite films of all time, period.First off, though, I'll discuss the newfound problems that I discovered with the film upon my most recent viewing, chief among which is the film's habit of relying on clunky, blatant exposition delivered through incredibly unnatural-sounding dialogue, where the characters spoonfeed us the Nolan brothers' rather naive, black-and-white moral outlooks (at one point, a character literally says \"This city just showed you that it's full of people ready to believe in good\"... just, ugh). The characters just too often talk like they're actually aware of the presence of the audience that they're currently lecturing to, and sound like no real person ever would, a problem that could've easily been fixed with just a little more polish on the writing side of things.In addition to that, the film doesn't always pace itself the best when it comes to its editing and overall structure, sometimes rushing through certain moments and scenes by cutting away too quickly, instead of giving things room to properly breathe, along with having an overly compressed overall timeline, with too many events happening one on top of the other on top of the other at times. And finally, the film's inclusion of a certain legally-dubious surveillance system feels like an unnecessary, half-baked nod to the common perception of a post-9/11 \"surveillance state\" (as if this movie needed any more echoes of that event), which mostly skirts the issue of the spotty \"righteousness\" of Batman's particular breed of vigilantism, and continues the bad habit of the The Dark Knight trilogy for including random, poorly-integrated technological McGuffins into their storylines.Still, even with those moderate flaws, there's still more than enough greatness contained within The Dark Knight to render it an absolutely amazing film on the whole, and first and foremost among its many strengths has to be the tremendous overall scope and relentless intensity of the entire affair, right from the beginning of its Michael Mann-inspired opening bank heist, until the final, iconic note that concludes its 2 & 1/2 hour long saga.This is not your father's Batman movie by any stretch of the imagination, rather, basically an epic, multi-layered crime drama that just so happens to have Batman in it, which does at times cause something of a disconnect between the film's relatively grounded nature and the inherently silly imagery of a grown man fighting crime while dressed as a gigantic bat, but for the most part, The Dark Knight finds a good balance between creating a unique reality that simultaneously feels plausible and heightened at the same time, with the two qualities serving to strengthen the other, as the film presents to us a more realistic version of Gotham City, albeit one that's still populated by the legendary heroes and villains of the storied Batman canon, including, of course, Heath Ledger's iconic, Oscar-winning portrayal of the ultimate Bat-baddy, The Joker.Ledger's gleefully sadistic Joker is basically a complete force of nature here, almost always stealing the show whenever he's on screen regardless of whatever else is going on, as his hideously scarred, Glasgow smile-visage, creepy facial tics, and mocking, off-kilter line deliveries dovetale with his horrifically random acts of terror and anarchy to create not only the perfect foil to the Dark Knight, but the first Batvillian to feel like he could actually defeat Batman (in an ideological sense as well as a physical one). It's a true tour-de-force performance that gives Batman's greatest foe a far darker, more malevolent spin, completely unlike any of his other live-action characterizations, and Ledger's Joker is rendered even more disturbing by Hans Zimmer's dissonant score, which prominently featured razor blades run across stringed instruments in order to intill an appropriately sinister, unsettling musical motif for the character. Tragically, Ledger passed away before the film's release, but his Joker has still gone down in history as one of cinema's greatest villians, a fact further canonized by the richly deserved, post-humous Academy Award he won for Best Supporting Actor for his amazing performance here.And, despite the occasionally clunky writing, the film's central conflict between, and discussions of, the struggle between order and chaos in society, the two forces that Batman and The Joker so vividly represent, give the film a real world relevance that no live-action Batfilm (and very few superhero films) have ever had before. But of course, none of the characters, including The Joker, would count for as much without Nolan's incredibly ambitious hands guiding the film, as he truly swings for the fences here and constantly hits homers while doing so, creating an epic, multi-faceted, larger than life tale, driven by a dark, tragic tone, busy (in a good way) plotting, and an absolutely propulsive overall pace, almost never slowing down, but continually ramping things up to an almost unbearable degree, with a dread-laden, almost apocalyptic tone underpinning the whole affair. This is truly an uncommonly, undeniably powerful piece of pop entertainment, and all in all, my rewatch has convinced me that the (dark) knight in shining armor of modern-day cinema is officially here to stay, for a long, long time.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not the greatest film ever made",
    "reviewBody": "Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, it's not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it ain't so hot. The film's first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, there's another 70 plus minutes to go, and the film's second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I don't expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolan's screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, we're expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So let's tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero).",

    "reviewTitle": "This Film Entertains, Big-Time!",
    "reviewBody": "This was extremely entertaining all the way through, which is quite a statement for a film that is two-and-a-half hours long. There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating film. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story, but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does.A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his \"The Joker\" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!Actually, he and Aaron Eckert, who played \"Harvey 'Two Face' Dent,\" were most of the show, character-wise. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good, too, as \"Rachel Dawes,\" the woman of both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent's affections. Otherwise, the familiar good guys - Christopher Bale as \"Batman,\" Michael Caine as \"Alfred,\" Gary Oldman as Inspector/Commishoner Gordan\" and Morgan Freeman as \"Lucius Fox\" were okay but all more interesting in the previous film, \"Batman Begins.\" Speaking of Fox, his high-and-mighty attitude toward Wayne's surveillance system was disappointing to hear. I had thought he had trust in Bruce Wayne. Also, I was sorry to hear the language deteriorate in the final half hour with some unneeded profanity by some inconsequential character.Overall, however, this latest Batman movie ranks among the best of any I've seen, at least on the first viewing. I'm looking forward to watching it again when the Blu-Ray disc comes out next month. This is a great film to enjoy visually and audibly with some fantastic action scenes and excellent dialog.I had heard that Batman was a \"dark\" and almost unlikable figure, himself, in this film but I did not find that. Hey, he did what he had to do to stop a maniacal killer (which \"Fox\" didn't understand., nor some of the other main characters.) For a guy who has provided nothing but good deeds for the fickle citizens of Gotham over the years, this hero certainly doesn't appear to be appreciated......except by his fans of comics and film.In fact, that's the only main thing I would dispute with the writers of this movie: their conclusion at the end that Batman is \"not a hero, but a dark knight.\" No, I would say someone who continually risks his life to save others is quite a hero!",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman just got really modern",
    "reviewBody": "This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didn't feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very cliché way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn't as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Serious Epic",
    "reviewBody": "A fast paced action epic with some real unforgettable movements. From the initial routine bank heist to blowing up a damn hospital, this movie has it all. The movie is as dark as it's title in both a literal and metaphorical sense. The duality of good, evil, light, dark, chaos and order are on full display through the movie where for most of the movie Gotham truely feels like a city on the precipice of collapse. Following on from Batman Begins, Christian Bales Batman seems to need little introduction as the hero of the story, which allows for Heath Ledgers joker to be explored and ultimately shine as the most interesting villain I've ever seen. The self proclaimed 'agent of chaos' attempts to exhibit his pseudo-moralistic claims about society through his large scale terroristic social experiments. Eventually he proves that he could corrupt the 'white knight' Harvey Dent by killing the innocent and intelligent love interest Rachel Dawes. Harvey symbolises a morally righteous bureaucratic in a crime ridden society attempting to retain its order. He represents a glimmering last hope for Gotham, but eventually gives in to the chaos leaving his own life as well as many others up to the chance of a coin toss. His coin appeared to signify that there is a light and a dark side, when the cards are down, ones loyalties are shown to be fickle. In the movies conclusion, the cruise ship experiment demonstrates that chaos is not inevitable, the victims chose good over evil eliciting a spark of faith for the future of Gotham. Furthermore in the films final conclusion, Batman is referred to as the dark knight, because he's not a traditional hero, he's a vigilante who's reputation be tarnished for the greater good. The hero who doesn't get the recognition or praise, but the one who does the right thing without behind the scenes, hence 'dark knight'. Overall the movie is without a dull-moment and it's themes are deeply complex. For a 'superhero' movie it's stands alone, perfectly balancing epic action sequences with dialogue about human nature and society.",

    "reviewTitle": "12 years later",
    "reviewBody": "As a huge fan of Begins anda Batman fan in general I was very excited by this movie. I'm not really sure why this became as big a hit as it did but I was glad that everyone was onboard. The only things that initially disappointed me were things like Two Face dying and things like that because he's so important to Batman's future. But as we know now they weren't creating a Batman series, they were telling a 3 part story. That's what they did so well in these movies, take the established characters and make it their own. I was also disappointed that the heart of Begins was kinda missing. Of course Rises makes up for this making this middle chapter the action movie.Heath Ledger was a strange choice initially and everybody was mad. I trusted Nolan after Begins and of course Ledger was great. I love their take on the Joker as the criminal and the smart guy. And of course the paint and scars and doing away with the acid. Also not knowing his background is much stronger. People always act like he's this really deep and complex character and it's not. I do think his performance is a little much at times, good but could be dialed down in places.Harvey Dent was also done brilliantly. His whole story/impact on Batman is done here and in Rises. He wants to do the right thing and looses it. If there was more time I'm sure he could have come back to the good side.The story puts Batman to the test in every way. When you look back on the series he's really only Batman for 6 months. He comes back for the events in Rises but even then he's at war and not fighting crime.These movies are focused on grounding Batman. Like how the bad guy is mob/corruption and not super villains. Batman is created from Gotham needing him not his declaration that Gotham needs him. Then The Joker wears paint because of him. He would have always been a criminal but the fact that a masked man is around causes him to escalate his own look. In the movies this stuff is unprecedented, no one thinks it's normal at all.I'm not really sure how this movie became the end all be all of movies. It's my least favorite of the trilogy for sure. And while it's good I don't think it's a bench mark. I think Rises took what this movie started and did much more with it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Mediocre",
    "reviewBody": "Yawn.A few years ago, despite repeated critical praise and entreaties from friends and colleagues, I gave up on ever wasting my precious time on earth watching another Steven Spielberg film. Time and again I was told, by others, 'No, this time I really mean it, it's a GREAT film,' and time and again I would leave the theater angry or nauseous. But, now I am at the point where I feel the same way about ALL Hollywood tripe. As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were. They weren't. Similarly, almost all the reviews of The Dark Knight were glowing; especially praising the performance of Heath Ledger (the cock-mumbling hero of Brokeback Mountain) as the Joker. And with his demise shortly before last year's premiere of the film, the inevitable chorus of Oscar buzz for his performance rose, with him, indeed, snagging a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination and win (ala James Dean). So, was this the greatest film of all time? Was Ledger's performance one for the ages?No.In fact, not even close. And, as badly hyped as the Spielberg stool has been, and as nauseating as the PC films named above were, The Dark Knight, and Ledger's performance, have to be the two most over the top unbelievably hyper-hyped things Hollywood has ever unfurled. Why? Simple. The picture barely rises above mediocre, and Ledger is nowhere near as good a Joker as Jack Nicholson was, twenty years ago, in Tim Burton's Batman.The Dark Knight simply goes on for far too long- 153 minutes- and gets worse with each passing minute. It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so. A good 45 minutes could have been lopped off with no discernible detraction from the film. In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF? questions wiser generations will chuckle over. The Dark Knight is not good comic book stuff, it's not good sci fi, it's not a good action film. It's just hype.Yawn. (the sequel)",

    "reviewTitle": "Why IS it so serious?",
    "reviewBody": "Three and a half years after the hype, sycophantic reviews, and mass hysteria have died down I am now ready to review this film with a level-headed opinion. Is it good. Yes, quite. Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be? No, certainly not. The Dark Knight has faults, not the least of which is the unjustifiably bloated running time.With criminals in Gotham now looking over their shoulders (or should I say to the sky) for Batman, the crime-rate is gradually falling. But when anarchic, nihilistic Joker appears to stir things up between the cops and crooks the fight against crime is cranked up to the max. The Joker is out to create as much chaos as possible, not caring for himself or others. Meanwhile District Attorney Harvey Dent tackles the criminals as honestly as he can with Rachel Dawes glassy-eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections. This is spread out over 153 minutes, and in long stretches you'll begin to feel every second of it.Much of this film's running time could have been trimmed and many scenes jettisoned. I know I am not alone in admitting that a sequence midway through the film involving dead bodies in an apartment and the re-building of a shattered bullet just confuses me. The sequence seems to come out of nowhere. I know Batman is supposed to be a detective but this was just nonsense. Nolan could have come up with a better method of leading Bruce Wayne to the trap with the window and sunshade. Also, there is a moment near the end when Salvatore Marone tells Commissioner Gordon that he knows where the Joker's going to be. Nothing becomes of this.You'd have to be pretty stupid not to connect the dots when it comes to the corrupt cops who sell-out Gordon at every opportunity too. Real lazy writing there. I just couldn't get involved with Harvey Dent either. His story, struggle, and motivations did not interest me in the slightest and I found the character flat and boring. Gary Oldman as Gordon also bored me to tears. What exactly are we supposed to like about this character? With the exception of temporally faking his own death he never once proved himself to be competent. I longed for the Joker to show up and put them all out of my misery. Not much of the dialogue is memorable. It sounds as if the characters are talking out to the audience while none of the words actually gel and no eye-lines connect. Little of it feels like a realistic conversation. It's virtually all just perfectly rehearsed movie dialogue from over-written comic-book characters.I wish that Nolan would stop shying away from violence. When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything. The pencil trick happens fast (and off-screen), no blood effects follow gunfire, few of the punches are seen connecting. I understand the need to keep it a PG-13 but come on! Aside from a car and helicopter explosion there aren't many deaths seen occurring on screen, most of the time leaving you wondering what happened (as with Gambol's death).There are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe.Like Batman Begins, it's all so straight and brick-faced. I really ought to ask Christopher Nolan \"Why so serious?\"",

    "reviewBody": "Good movies should create \"the willing suspension of disbelief,\" meaning you forget that it's just actors and special effects. This movie failed to deliver that for me. I kept waiting for it to match the review hype but it only had random moments.The Eastwood/Devil voice of Batman needed explanation. It was too far off from his regular voice, like a crank caller. Was it just assumed to be an identity trick? It was hard to work up empathy for either Wayne or Batman. The best acting I've seen from C.B. was in \"The Machinist\" (a far more disturbing and better film than this).Excessive lesions on C.B. and M.G. were distracting in close-ups but that's not unique to this film. M.G. isn't what I would call hot, and it's unclear how she got to be the object of rich desires. She added a dowdy effect that dampened the felt urgency of certain things.Many special effects went beyond fantasy. Vehicle mass defied inertia laws in crashes; like the Bionic Man pushing a building. The bat-cycle was ludicrous in how it could blast every obstacle out of its way. The cellphone sonar was logistically absurd, if even technically possible. I like special effects with some chance of realism. The half face, half sinew thing was well done, but the sudden meanness of the D.A. seemed forced.I found the opening bank scene the most engrossing, promising part. The guy on the street corner dangling the mask had a spookiness I was expecting from the rest of the film, but it washed out. Where was all the \"darkness\" reviewers wrote of? I guess he kept kid audiences in mind. The Joker was well done but no more menacing than random creeps interrogated on C.S.I.Most importantly, the plot didn't feel naturally driven by events (see title of review). I think a rare combination of hype and the death of H.L. carried this film to a higher status than it deserved.",

    "reviewTitle": "I'm sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece.",
    "reviewBody": "** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why \"The Dark Knight\" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: \"But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible.\" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as \"The Dark Knight\" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere \"superhero movie,\" or \"action movie.\" Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in \"The Prestige\" was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in \"Thank You For Smoking.\" Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such \"The Dark Knight\" succeeded in escaping the \"superhero movie\" label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes.",

I was thoroughly enjoying myself, and was having it go mano-a-mano with my all-time favorite superhero movie, Spider-Man 2. By the time Batman swerved around the Joker on his motorcycle, I was getting a little restless, a 7.5 maybe, and set the score around 7.5 or so; still liked the film, and was pleased that at least I was going to give it a positive grade, to spare myself the hassle. By the time Harvey Dent was chillin' in a warehouse with ol' Jim, I was rooting for Batman to die if only to end the film more quickly.There is a good film in here. Hell, there's a GREAT film in here, but my god, to humanize this film is to implore it to do a few crunches. The Dark Knight is hideously, mindbogglingly, monstrously overlong. Every source physical and electronic had informed me that the time FLEW by that it may have lasted two hours and thirty-two minutes, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it. Well, they're right. It DIDN'T feel like two hours and thirty-two minutes. It felt like three. By the time Dent got his faced burned, I was glad that it was finally wrapping up, because it had gone on a bit too long at that point. The HOUR that it spent unnecessarily wrapping up plot strands after that scene was what killed the film for me.There was definitely a lot to like here. In a superhero film, the constant is the hero, the variable, and thus, the definition of quality, is in the villain. The Joker is the best of the Batman villains because he's the most colorful, and yet the most terrifyingly plausible. He embodies things we fear on a fundamental level: People who hide their identity,in masks and grotesque makeup, who are unhinged, who can and will do anything on a whim. Where other villains include a poof who tells riddles and a man raised by penguins sewer (don't worry about correcting me if I got that wrong, I don't care), the Joker seems horrifyingly impervious to scrutiny.In the acting department, I had surprisingly little problem with Bale. He seemed less brooding and more personable, more lively than I had seen him. When he put on his scaaawy voice, my entire theater chuckled, but I understood what he was trying to do; it far more real and acceptable than before. As for the rest of the cast, Ledger did a good job, but by the halfway point, I grew tired of the film treating him as an go-to gag machine. The longer we sat with him, I saw him descend from Jerry Brudos into Jerry Lewis. People seem to overestimate the difficulty in playing a crazy person. Talk with a funny voice, affect a little walk, invent a couple of mannerisms, it's really all in the definition. The entire film, I was thinking: You know who could have been fabulous at this role? Andy Dick. Seriously, Ledger's put-on voice sounded almost exactly like Dick's normal voice, and there's a built-in hatred for the man anyway, what better way to immediately cultivate a visceral audience reaction? I think he could have done a fine job. Aaron Eckhart, on the other hand, was quite poor. He had the chiseled chin, and I know the man can act, but here he just seemed out of his element. Far too often, I saw Aaron Eckhart acting when I should have seen Harvey Dent speaking. As for positives, I thought Maggie Gyllenhall was a tremendous upgrade on Katie Holmes. She infused the character with dimensions and life, and she convinced me every second she was on screen. Michael Caine also did a fine job, and I want to give a mention to Eric Roberts, who I thought stained the screen with the sleaze emitting from his body in his meager calls to set. Most of the rest of the cast had little to do, although I was still lamenting that, as good as job as he did on the good side, possibly the great go-to villain actor of the last generation will never be given a chance to enliven a Batman villain.Batman Begins, which I gave a 6/10, ran 2:20. I don't remember feeling it was overlong, just sort of lame. While, The Dark Knight is as far from lame as you can get, but that other problem reared its ugly had and caused me far more pain that the immediate fizzle of its predecessor, because it had so much going for it, and it seemed to have squandered it with a wasted hour that did NOTHING NEW for the characters. Did anything that important happen in the final hour of the film that hadn't happened at least once beforehand? And every new thing they did introduced was so labored and obvious that it was just as much of a time waster as everything else.The word, more than any other, that I want to use for my opinion towards this film is \"lament\". I wanted to LOVE this film, to be greeted with open arms by my electronic peers into their cool, hip club that apparently numbers in the billions. And my initiation was all set. Bruce, Chris & I had passed several hurdles, several tests, on our way to being accepted together, hand-in-hand, brothers in arms. But like Harvey Dent's infamous coin, the game was rigged. They flipped it until we failed, and fall flat on our faces we did. Or at least, I did. We took part in a five-legged race, and they persevered while I got stuck with the shackles, and that's too bad. The finish line was in site, but they kept moving it back, and all I taste is dirt.{Grade: 6.25/10 (C+) / #16 (of 60) of 2008}",

    "reviewTitle": "A Major Disappointment",
    "reviewBody": "This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It can't be *that* great, right? Right.I can't say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledger's Joker does indeed live up to the hype. It's a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work.After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you can't see what's really going on. What's really missing from the action is any sense of a story; there's just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that.Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but that's not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero).Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledger's scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact.Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bale's performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture.Batman Begins was a strong picture, and I'm puzzled as to what I'm missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end.",

    "reviewTitle": "Overlong, overfunded, overstaffed, overrated---merely okay.",
    "reviewBody": "I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than \"the best movie ever\" or perhaps just \"the best movie of 2008\", that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel.But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end.I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, \"graphic novels\") into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious.To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be.But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences.Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is \"Shawshank Redemption\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\". It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes.",

    "reviewBody": "Sigh. Christopher Nolan almost got it right with the right franchise (Batman represents the hunted hero allegory for the male human condition well). Unfortunately, the franchise rebootism, the gross overuse of computer generated imagery (CGI), plus the film's graphic novel vs live action antagonism, for me, became highly problematic.I asked myself just when did I drop out of the movie? -Well, 11 minutes in. By then there were already too many issues with Nolan's juggernaut. Here are some of them:1) the many filmic reboots irritating our story concept,2) the prologue brazenly ripping off Yves Simoneau's 2003 TV docudrama \"44 Minutes:The_North_Hollywood_Shoot-Out\" (without acknowledgement),3) wasting William Fichtner in a nothing role,4) too many red herrings of the ridiculous faux \"Batdudes\",5) Batman's ridiculous audio-\"soured\" voice,6) \"Lieutenant\" Gordon's similarly audio-\"soured\" voice in the vault (why?) on \"we'd have to hit all the banks simultaneously...\"And all this in the first 11mins!!Soon we're hit with the disingenuous tangent about Commissioner Gordon aimed at the ignorant in the audience. Everyone who knows this franchise expression will never accept \"Lieutenant\" Gordon's untimely death...but it's enough to turn us against the screenwriter! This is called \"ratcheting the plot\", aka \"yanking the audience's chain\".There's a lot more where this came from.TDK, as an early superhero film, suffers from graphic novel vs live action antagonism. It can be hard to show the impossible realistically, and when the allegory goes too far, we're back in disbelief.During the transportation scene with Harvey Dent (Eckhart), both the suspicious cabin crew action and the over-the-top \"SLAUGHTER\" graffiti on the attacking rig just makes us lose patience with the film's dropped police procedural tone.Christopher Nolan raised the bar for Batman, but just not far enough, so TDK seems to undermine its own new standard. Computer generated imagery (CGI) certainly can be a trap like catnip to many directors, but its use actually controls the tone of a film. So if you decided to make Two-Face's closeups show his skinless CG-musculature for shock value, then you deserve flak for making your film too \"schlocky\".More examples of wrong tonal balance:7) The dinner scene debating Batman's role in a democracy is admirable, but its execution is mired in table hubbub between two couples. The gravitas is lost in the shuffle.8) Bruce Wayne's awful speech pillorying Harvey Dent undermines our faith in Bruce as well. His venom was so unnecessary that he actually tries to undo the effect for Rachel Dawes (doesn't Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes again smack of rebootism?).9) Harvey/Gordon's prisoners in the traffic snarl deserved more screen-time. The battle of wills with The Joker represents the film's \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" so the audience needed to emotionally be with the ferry scene already.10) Two-Face was too cartoonish/rabid for live action, even in context. Harvey is depicted as having been so well-adjusted prior that the overwrought burning and accidental loss of his fiancée simply doesn't justify his later violence. His dementing rings utterly false. Without showing more of his back-story, it's irresponsible to either kill the character or turn him so deeply and irrevocably psychotic, all in one film.11) Dent's hospital-room screaming is implausible: he shouldn't have enough strength to roar at Gordon, let alone been allowed by ER doctors to reject tissue grafts! Deeply, deeply ridiculous. Moreover, how can he talk properly with ONLY half of his mouth missing lips? His entire CGI facial concept just for the sake of CGI remains completely implausible. It's a fundamental break with the film's pretence at live action. How can we suspend our disbelief? Perhaps by all of us turning into 8yr old boys... and there now appear to be billions of 'em.12A) Such deep burn victims never have clean muscle afterwards anyway, so why wasn't Dent's CGI face just mottled flesh? Well, to stick to the gross graphic novel design concept for all the 8yr old boys: schlock on steroids.12B) Dent's skeletal musculature CGI is even wrong within the Batman mythos. There was no plotted reason for the deep burn at all, since Batman was rescuing Dent from the flames. Why is Two-Face so gross? Again, over-indulgence of CGI to \"deliver the schlock\", long computed by studios as mandated together with sci-fi.13) The interrogation cell scene was annoying directorial self-indulgence. It was darkened outrageously during Gordon's interrogation just for the Batman reveal. Completely implausible, it relies on Nolan controlling \"the fourth wall\" (the audience's POV). Overripe, ridiculous, and insulting to the audience.TDK(2008) does make several great points, but I'll let others expound on that. For me, it's sufficient to sing the 8yr old Bart Simpsons parody: \"Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin ran away\"...",

    "reviewBody": "Heath Ledger's edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his costume is the right colours, but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like he's been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars, smudged & cracked white wash, blacken sharks eyes of death, capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks and tongue snakes, his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. As fans, we wait to finally hear the Joker's maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of choice (not the lint or veg peeler) is the knife, for both it's ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for The Batman, Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into the minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a world without rules, where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the transformation of Gotham's White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent.The eerie background \"music\" is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through Gotham's cityscapes as a harbinger of the Joker's evil to come.In all fairness Ledger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burton's 80's film delivered a comic book to screen, thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave that's stamped with Jack's vintage trademark. Ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that won't let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that Ledger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers, namely Hopkins/Lecter, Spacey/Doe.This is a tour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype (rare thing) and even raises the bar (even rarer). So kudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember, the next time you're playing a card game your hand may come up with the Joker's signature calling card. RIP HL.",

    "reviewBody": "\"Work in the shadows. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using any means at our disposal to achieve our objective.\" – Dick Cheney\"The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist, and its power is employed above all to enforce this claim.\" - Guy DebordChris Nolan's \"Dark Knight\" stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire weapons contractor who moonlights as Batman, a powerful superhero who beats up terrorists. Politically, some critics believe the film to be advocating the suspension of democracy in a time of terror. Others see it as endorsing scepticism of a leader's claims to free reign during a \"state of emergency\" (which is often the leader's own creation).The truth is, the film presents the usual two-party, false binary present year after election year. Batman and politician Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) represent the opposite poles of so-called democratic politics. Batman, operating outside the law to protect the defenceless people of Gotham City, represents your typical Bush/Cheney/Nixon cryptofascist, rationalising what he does (torture, law breaking etc) for the \"good of the homeland\". Kipling called this the \"white man's burden\"; men rationalise their evil as a noble and necessary burden which must be righteously carried so as to spare others the load. Dent, meanwhile, along with one Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), are idealistic, by-the-books types. Both learn to be \"pragmatic\" and collaborate with vigilantes (Batman), if only to take down bad guys. Batman, Dent thinks, has become a necessity.The film really tips its ideological hand during its Greek-tragedy final hour. Dawes, the most liberal of all the \"good guys\", dies at the hands of a terrorist called Joker (Heath Ledger), whilst the pragmatist Dent, scarred in war, abandons his ideals and embraces the Joker's ethos of chaos. In other words, we must accept the cold embrace of Batman if we want to be secure. Dent's law abiding idealism doesn't work. It's two faced and is merely a mask for chaos and disorder.The Joker, with his Al-Qaeda like video recordings, his constant attacks on \"women and children\" and his advocacy of terrorism and chaos, is a figure who stands propagandistically for \"America's enemies\". IE- America's enemies are not an oppressed and exploited, diverse and divided group trying with futility to resist in various ways, but rather, they are a fundamentally irrational, monstrous, chaotic and lawless cult of death. Thus, the Joker offers only the wild, amoral, killing life beyond the protective (and expansionist) borders of \"democracy\" (aka corporatist imperialism).The moral is as old, and as conservative, as Hobbes. The film says we can live in a wild, murderous wasteland OR a lawless, authoritarian police state. It doesn't matter which of these options the film presents as more appealing or fun, all that matters is that no other options present themselves. This false binary, rife with straw-men, is the complete opposite to something like \"Hellboy 2\", where our superheroes retire once they realise that the government for which they've been working ultimately opposes the difference and diversity they represent. Compared to \"Dark Knight\", this is genuinely radical.Late in the film, Joker places a massive bet on the assumption that most people are as viciously indifferent to other human beings as he is. The Batman's counter-bet is that people are devoted to morals, order and authority. Batman wins, an act which serves not to celebrate Gothan's morality, but to legitimise the Dark Knight.The bad guys themselves are an assortment of freaks and ethnic minorities while the good guys are, with the exception of slave boy Morgan Freeman, uptight bourgeois white Americans. The most virtuous of them is the \"Great White Hope\", Harvey Dent. Harvey, though his crusade against crime is on the legal side, secretly loves Batman's underground campaign of terror and Guantanamo Bay styled \"free reign\". In fact, Gotham police relies on Batman to break legs, smash faces, interrogate and torture on their behalf. And Batman, with enormous resources at his disposal, doesn't shirk from breaking international law to abduct a Chinese target or from erecting a colossal surveillance machine which makes Bush's extensive illegal wiretapping and water-boardings look lame. This subplot of the film is particularly insidious in light of the NSA's illegal PRISM, ECHELON and MUSCULAR surveillance programmes, ostensibly to \"stop terrorists\", but really to aid big business, spying on financial ministers, charities, leftists etc. In short, Batman is bad simply because the state can't afford to be seen being bad. What's odd is that Batman's struggle is not a collective one. The few members of the public who do try to \"copycat\" Batman's antics end up being butchered.To protect Gotham, Batman and the police eventually create serial lies and myths for public consumption. It's the \"noble lie\" which the masses need to sustain their morale. In other words, leaders (Bush, Nixon etc) are self-righteously willing to be seen as immoral, under the understanding that you understand that what they do they do, Christ-like, for you. They protect us from Joker. Of course in the real world the nature of Joker is covered up, and Batman does nothing but enhance his own material wealth and power by way of the Joker's shocks to Gotham's system. And so the \"Knight\" boils down to age old authoritarian motives: in order to have social stability you need a lie. The real hero of the film is actually the Joker, but the film's PG13 rating prevents it from dealing with this seriously. I'll take the Joker's anarchistic chaos over Batman's archaic commitment to corrupt systems of law and order any day. Not only that, Joker's psycho ramblings and burning towers of cash are infinitely more entertaining than Batman's Multi-million Dollar Extreme Warfare Batmobile.6/10 - Popcorn fascism. Despite a strong first half, \"Knight's\" second half drowns in messily shot action and needless subplots. See \"Die Hard 3\".",

    "reviewBody": "For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know it's all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I don't mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so it's possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a \"comic book\" movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesn't seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all timesHas a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You don't care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Good Adventure But Falls Back on Greatness",
    "reviewBody": "The main highlights of this dismal, dark isolated atmospheric superhero adventure movie is the Joker's (Heath Ledger) appearances the climactic special effects like the explosions and the believable dark clouds that surround this dreary, but riveting blockbuster. According to demographics, the majority of the audience who went to see \"The Dark Knight\" are 85% males between 18-35 who's minds are fixated on video games. And that is a non-surprising statistic.With the exception of Ledger's stunning performance, this movie fails to carry out its promise in gathering our interest in watching the good usurp the forces of evil, almost to the point where we take more sympathy for the evil Joker than the dark hero himself, Batman(Christian Bale).Bruce Wayne comes on to me as philandering playboy and his portrayal is thinner than a Ritz cracker. His envy and rage over the new female D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is more juvenile in personality without any sign of emotion at all. Even when they embrace in that fatal kiss, it's more manipulative than inspiring. Batman's robotic voice and stoic expressions convinces the audience into thinking, is that a man or a cyborg? This pedestrian performance may give the audience the impression that this movie was never meant for adults to watch. The anger and rage manifested in the Joker's soul has some spark of appeal and sorrow, but the schtick eventually become monotonous after a while that it becomes tiring after a while. The final scenes in the movie has very little excitement that afterwords people started to slowly trickle out of the cinema disappointed because of the set-up. It was just pure banal.Though it's not the worst movie in the world, it's still very over-rated in the end. The real standout was the Clown Prince of Evil himself the Joker. But even he couldn't save this movie himself. He wasn't getting any real help from his co-stars. But if you are those who just want to watch the movies just to see Heath Ledger one last time? Well the more power to you, but you really shouldn't do that on account of someone's unfortunate premature death.",

    "reviewBody": "If I'd been sitting at the end of a row in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes. I've sat through enough hard hitting films to know the difference between meaningful grit and wanton hatefulness. The production values in this film are so high that the 'terror' that is deliberately laid down seems genuinely possible in its evilness. The killings and explosions however do not support the supposedly 'psychological' subtext. Two men sitting either side of the same coin...or as Gotham DA's coin shows....both the same side... is not adequately developed. The story's many conflagrations and large set piece explosions cannot possibly have been set up by one man (The Joker) in any reasonable timescale - and certainly not in the one suggested in the film. The whole thing is just preposterous - it is just an exercise in slash and burn without relief. I had one hell of a headache after seeing this film - I can't have been the only one. One other patron I heard afterwards was positively spitting with rage and contempt over being made to see a film about 'some psychopathic sociopath not Batman'. Heath Ledger evidently had to do himself in in order to kill off the blasted character seeing as Batman wasn't going to.",

    "reviewTitle": "all you need to know is......",
    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didn't. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so I'll skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesn't work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, \"abridged\" civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledger's Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stone's \"Natuarl Born Killers\" than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, \"no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie\". Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didn't. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents' clothing as they walked out.I don't blame the parents. This movie's PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a \"Batman\" movie! With a PG13 rating! \"Batman\" originated from a children's comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. It's not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits it's not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didn't like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of \"comic book\" appeal in it anywhere, and it will take it's place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest I'd say this, \"thanks for the memories\".",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman is finally talking sense and nonsense at once",
    "reviewBody": "Finally the new generation of Batman films has arrived and he is on the run. The film is long and there are many moments when no action happens, when the hero or the people are there to reflect upon events, to go down deep into themselves, to show us their feelings, their fears, their hopes. The film becomes a lot more psychological, mental even. It is talking of people, real people and how they react and live in a tense situation. The best moment of the film is when the people themselves have to decide who is going to die, them on one side or the others on the other side. They can do it on both sides and neither sides do it. They vote overwhelmingly for killing the others and yet they don't carry out their decision. Democracy is the worst imaginable regime because a majority is always found for the least ethical decisions that more or less demagogically please the masses, caress them in the right direction. And yet it remains the best because in these worst situations imaginable the people kind of react against the horror and the terror and do not follow the majority rule or reveal another layer of majority rule deeper and finer, well hidden but always ready to come out. The film shows how what is at stake is not what the masses are going to do in a crisis situation. It is what are the few individuals who have power and the means to use that power going to do, or rather become? And there the answer is super-negative. Individuals are always corrupted by the forces behind the terror that swoops down onto the masses. That's politics and that's well seen. And yet that's false when the film pretends these few corruptible people can be stopped. At least not the way the film says. They are never corrupted alone and they move into that corrupted state along with quite many people, armed forces, security forces and even more. The film is deeply reflecting on recent events but the diagnosis is wrong and the solution is wrong too. It will not be enough to get rid of the corrupted individual. It will not even be enough to get rid of him and the inner circle of his legion. You will have to explain why at a certain moment that man captured a vast majority of the people in elections or just public opinion. And you'll have to provide a way to reverse that fact and to prevent it from happening again. And then you will find you cannot prevent that because such massive support to evil when it is draped in a long shining armor of good is long lasting, very long lasting. The next solution is to turn that corrupted person into a dead hero. But then you have to turn your best friend into the fiend the masses require. Think of president Saakashvili in Georgia. He took the decision to send troops into Ossetia. That was a bad decision showing how he had been corrupted by his re-election and the anti-Russian feelings of some. You can even say he had been influenced if not directly manipulated by the Russians, or even by the West which more or less promised support, even military, another manipulation of course. His mind got corrupted and he provoked the big northern neighbor and he got what he deserved: his two military bases destroyed, the main airport destroyed, the main harbor destroyed, the basic infrastructures disrupted, the pipelines stopped. A military, economic, social and political catastrophe. Then what? Oust him and turn him into a hero? Follow the call of the hard liners among the people and start a guerrilla warfare adventure, provided the Russians decided to stay in Georgia? Send Bush to bury him deep and under a thick layer of concrete? Punish the Russians with isolation, as if they gave a damn about it because we, in the West, need their natural gas and their oil, not the reverse. This film is thus discussing this fundamental issue of what do we do with corrupted leaders who have commanded at some time in their careers vast support from the masses? The solution proposed is unrealistic. But the film is superb, especially because the Joker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown. This time he is not a clown at all. And that is true: terrorism, even criminal terrorism and not political terrorism, is not funny, is not a game, is not a show. And it has means to get under the skin of most people. And then there is no solution, except an innocent fiend who will be on the run forever, like Ben Laden? We can wonder if our enemies, fiends are not such illusive evil beings who are not that evil but are necessary for the real evil ones to be kept in place. And are there even really alive, are they really real? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",

Although he isn't my favorite Joker, he does have the best live action portrayal of said character and he does phenomenal job at playing the psychopath. And i definitely can show respect for how committed Heath Ledger was to this rolemy \"empty\" feeling comes from the ultimate villain of the film, Two-Face. There is a fantastic portrayal of Two-Face in this film and he almost kills Gordon's son at the end of the film and it leaves you stunnedall in all, this is the best film out of the entire trilogy by far and i enjoy it!",

    "reviewTitle": "Not as good as \"The Dark Whopper\"",
    "reviewBody": "So Dean and I headed to Forest Hill Weds night to watch \"The Dark Knight\". Here's my controversial review.I'd been waiting to see this for a while, mostly because of how good \"Batman Begins\" was but also because of the rave reviews of Heath Ledger's performance, apparently his best since \"10 Things I Hate About You\". Went in expecting a truly classic cinematic performance...and i gotta say i was disappointed.The film starts out with a gripping bank robbery, done by some blokes in Joker masks. I got all excited when i saw William Fichtner as the bank manager who looked like he was going to foil the robbery, but alas his impact was minimal and he was soon dead. After his performance in \"Go\", he shouldn't be taking crummy roles like that. Anyway we're soon shown the power and craziness of the Joker and his desire to be Gotham's master criminal. Yep, the Joker is chilling but in what will be an unpopular opinion, I reckon you could have put Screech from \"Saved By The Bell\" in that make up, with those lines, and be about 80% as terrified. We're then introduced to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, in his best role since \"Double Jeopardy\") , the District Attorney with no fear and free from any ounce of corruption and Gordon (Gary Oldman, in his finest role since \"Air Force One\"), the squeaky clean cop who is hell-bent on bringing down the city's crime. The Joker realises he must take down Dent,Gordon, as well as Batman to take the city over and hatches a brilliant plan to do so. Will he succeed? See it to find out.Now it was an OK movie, but way way over-hyped eg it's listed as No.3 on IMDb.com's all time best movie list. That puts it ahead of some pretty well known and respected movies ie Pulp Fiction, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Psycho and Taxi Driver just to name a few. I thought it was a decent script, with an excellent cast, but the film just got to clever for itself at times, or at least for a Batman movie. Having said that I missed one or two key moments of the movie, probably due to agitation more than anything else ie that Gordon was driving the van with Dent in the back. I just thought it was weird that the driver wasn't talking and must have been a baddie. It was way too long, at least by 30mins and didn't have enough Bruce Wayne time.Solid, but I still prefer Batman Begins. Some will love it, some may think it was a tad overdone.FInally, ledger's performance was good but let's not get carried away and put it up with DeNiro as Travis Bickle, Al Pacino as \"Scarface\", Anthony Hopkins as \"Hannibal\" or Keanu Reeves as \"Johnny Utah\".",

    "reviewTitle": "Mildly Disappointing Sequel; overlong dialog, less involving,",
    "reviewBody": "My expectation for Batman: The Dark Knight, the 2nd of the newer, sleeker installments was probably a little high mostly due to the word of mouth of co-workers/friends calling it better than/ as good as Batman Begins. Unfortunately I didn't think so. There is an awful lot of jockeying and expository dialog - too much - testing my patience. The media reported \"Oscar-Worthy\" performance by Ledger, while good, is not fantastic. He is only sporadically on the screen. It follows, the movie I think suffers from the film-makers trying to develop several story lines at once. The Joker should've been focused on more - (spoiler) instead we have the Joker, love triangle weirdness, and Harvey Dent villain development. Also, what is with Christian Bale's raspy (I'm masking my voice) line delivery when in the suit - detracting and awful. A fan of the original 89 movie, I'd also like to add both of the lead females in these newer Batman movies really don't bring the class and presence of Basinger from the original - they are the girl next door - Gyllanthal is a good actress but is not a fit in this movie imo (maybe even less so than Holmes in Batman Begins),... anyway.....,Interlaced were a great locale skyline/scene in Hong Kong, and about 2/3 of the way through a superior chase scene delivering (spoiler!) the most exhilarating moment technically in the movie - the tank transformation. There was some great final dialog by the Joker delivered to Batman too - For me these were badly needed elements, but few between. Also we have a less interesting/less imaginative crises - (spoiler) bomb hostages vs. weird kooky interesting hallucinogen idea in Begins. I was hoping for more \"wow\" moments, but instead got more hand-to-hand combat and rapid-fire expository dialog - ho-hum - Some editing and recasting could've done this movie some good. Mixed review, with several entertaining scenes trying to break out of the mold....",

    "reviewTitle": "Will be remembered as one of the best films of our time",
    "reviewBody": "If there is anyone who is an anti-Batman fan, it would be me. While I thought Batman Begins was one of the best of 2005, I did not care all that much for the first four Batman films. I actually despised Batman Returns to the point that it is entrenched firmly on my top 50 worst films of all time. With that in mind, I began hearing all of the accolades this film was getting before it's release. How Heath Ledger had turned in a performance of a lifetime. How this was being called the Godfather of Comic Book films. How this film was being lauded as one of the best films in the last ten years and so on. By now, you've heard them all. And to be honest, I resented that and I believed that it was simply the scope of Heath's death that was causing this love fest with The Dark Knight. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. Not only is this film the best film I have seen since American Beauty, it is one that moved me and reminded me why I fell in love with the art of film in the first place. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger and everyone involved should be proud that this film transcends comic book films, and it transcends the summer popcorn genre. It is a larger than life experience and it is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.As we all remember, the end of Batman Begins we were shown a new villain named the Joker that had been leaving his card at the scene of his crimes. This takes place shortly after that with the Joker and his henchmen robbing a bank that holds mob money. He steals a cool 68 million dollars in a well executed and highly improbable robbery. Soon he is crashing a mob meeting and introduces himself quite effectively with a disappearing pencil trick that gets everyone's attention. His thought process is that he knows the mob no longer has the respect they once did, and that is because of the Batman. He offers his services, to kill the Batman, but with a hefty price. When his prediction comes true later in the film, that the mobsters are not safe from Batman, they realize they do need him. Meanwhile, a new DA named Harvey Dent is keen on cleaning up the city in any way possible. When he realizes that Batman is actually good for the city, Bruce Wayne takes a liking to him and decides that Harvey will be his white knight. This may actually allow Bruce to live a normal life. But of course nothing goes as planned and when tragedy strikes Harvey and his loved one, all hell breaks loose in Gotham City and the Joker becomes more and more unstoppable. Soon of course we are headed down the inevitable mano a mano confrontation between Batman and The Joker, but in a way that has never been done before.The Dark Knight explores socio-political issues usually reserved for a Michael Mann film. Take one exchange between the Joker and Batman, on paper it sounds good, but to see it on screen is mesmerizing: \"Don't talk like one of them. You're not, even if you'd like to be. They need you right now. But when they don't, they'll cast you out...LIKE A LEPER. See their morals, their code...it's a bad joke...dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya, when the chips are down, these civilized people will EAT each other.\" Batman and The Joker are separated by a fine line. But that line is often crossed in the film and when the Joker puts Batman to the test, I think they switch personalities. The film works because it has iconic characters and wonderful performances no doubt, but it also works brilliantly because it treats the audience like they are smart and perceptive. Spiderman 3 this is not.It has to be mentioned of course that Heath Ledger gives a performance that has no equal. When I think of some of the great performances in film, I think of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, just to name a few. They have nothing on Heath. He is The Joker. You won't recognize him, you won't know that it is an actor, you will believe that there is a man named the Joker that is on screen and someone captured him on film. There is not a finer performance I can think of and if anyone wins best supporting actor this year besides him, it is their duty to thank the academy and then decline the award and give it to Heath. He is that good. The Joker is mesmerizing.The Dark Knight is a film for a generation of film lovers that has been begging for a better comic book film. This is that film. Even if you are not a big fan of these type of movies, it will win you over.10/10",

    "reviewBody": "I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just don't think they played them loudly. I don't like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn't believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because it's blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholson's output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burton's original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, let's say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250?",

    "reviewTitle": "Disappointing",
    "reviewBody": "Soon after watching the Dark Knight, I decided that it does not belong in IMDb's top 250 greatest movies of all time. It's a problem with IMDb. The minute a popular film hits the box office, what does it do? It skyrockets to the top 250. Of course, this happens because, whenever a big blockbuster first comes out, people get all hyped up about it and rate it 10 stars. They hardly ever take the time to recognize any faults that may be in the film. They just jump to conclusions to call it \"a masterpiece\" and \"best movie of the year.\" Now I too had looked forward to this movie for a while. I enjoyed Batman Begins, and saw all of the other Batman films.The Dark Knight takes what was originally a cheesy comic book concept and tries to turn it into a big-budget crime thriller. It doesn't exactly make the transition. Because of this, the whole film turns out to be contradictory. At no point does the atmosphere jibe with the source material. The Dark Knight is also much too long and it isn't even that engaging. I wanted to like it but found myself wanting it to be over already halfway through. The way it is structured is also very sloppy and disjointed. It's just one outrageous scene after another. The movie doesn't have a whole lot to offer apart from a great performance from Ledger. I feel that Batman is very weak in this film as a character, especially compared his portrayal in Batman Begins. The Joker really dominates the entire film, not leaving much room for Batman's character to be developed. Batman also speaks in a growl throughout this film. Yes, I know this was intended, but it is not very menacing, nor intimidating, but quite ridiculous. And it is made worse by the fact that The Joker is main character in the movie who poses much of a threat.Christian Bale is alright as Batman in this movie, but his performance is really dwarfed by that of Heath Ledger. Morgan Freeman is great as he almost always is--best acting in the whole film (besides Heath Ledger). Maggie Gyllenhaal is average in this movie, and I found myself not sympathizing with her character at all. She's just another wooden character. Gary Oldman is alright. Michael Caine is good, but I have seen him do better. Aaron Eckhart is very competent at playing his characters (Two-face and Harvey Dent). But it is pretty unbelievable how brutal he turns out to be, compared to his cordial personality in the beginning.The Dark Knight has one very good scene (the hospital scene), in which Two-face looks at his coin and finds it has half its side burned, just like his his face. I was very impressed with this scene. In my opinion, it is the one part of the movie that has any depth or symbolism. But I found many scenes in the movie to be poorly done, including the scenes with The Joker escaping from the prison, and the scenes with Batman on the motorcycle. These scenes rely on expensive special effects to compensate for a story that isn't very compelling.Also, the scene with the two ships at the end is way too long, far-fetched, and really just a poor scene overall. The movie flows somewhat until this point, but this scene is just intrusive and irrelevant to the movie. The whole scene is very anti-climatic and interrupting. Overall, I'd say The Dark Knight is ok as far as summer blockbusters go, but that's really not saying much. For many, the movie is made watchable by a great performance by Ledger, high-end special effects, and first-rate production value, but, for this viewer, the shoddy writing ruins its chances of ever becoming great. The Dark Knight isn't so disappointing that I would ask you not to watch it; it's probably worth watching if you really like Batman. I do not ask you to side with my negative opinion of the film, as I am of the minority. However, I do ask you to not blindly fall for the hype, as so many have done, and to acknowledge the faults present in the film. Thank you.",

    "reviewTitle": "Hollywood Gets It Right",
    "reviewBody": "This film is long at over 2 1/2 hours but that is because it does so much right that it takes that long to do the job. Everyone in the cast is terrific. The action is almost non-stop for this film too.Michael Caine is even better in this film than he was in Batman Begins. Morgan Freeman who has been busy this year (also in Wanted this summer) is fantastic. The film has times where the action is so intense that you almost get lost but it picks you up and doesn't let you get lost. Kudos to Christian Bale as he is even better here than in Batman Begins.Heath Ledger as the Joker is the big story. This is not a Joker like before, as this one is totally out there (and don't ask me where there is). His criminal activity is defined as unusually bizarre. He says it himself when he says in the movie that he just goes where he wants without any reason for what he is doing. The Joker actually starts the film robbing a bank. By the end of the movie, he has made that bank robbery seem and actually be pointless. The robbery is just a place to start the movie.The film starts dark & ends darker with very little light in the middle. It kills off people often and even one of the main roles is killed. It gives viewers a delightful UN-predictability not just too the Joker but to where the film is going.That is pretty much what makes this film go. I doubt than any film will top it this year. It even leaves Wanted in the dust grasping to catch up.",

I think it must be one of the best sci-fi or crime movies. Batman is also a human, he can't manage to do everything. He will upset when he lost. In another hand, Joker has nothing to lose, chaos is the only thing which can make him happy. They're two faces of a coin, the games between them is amazing. Fortunately, humanity doesn't let us down.The light of humanity is always shining! (P. S. Heath Ledger was a legend)",

    "reviewBody": "There have been three films to release over the years that achieved such closeness to perfection to me, this certainly is one of them. This movie has absolutely nothing wrong only things that were amazing. Sure there might someone with some nit picks but nothing that holds water. The only possibly accurate nit pick is the lack of a wrap up of the penthouse scene. Even that is very minuscule and practically unnoticeable in the watching process. The most perfect part about this film is the level of cinematic perfection of villainy that Heath Ledger achieved. Not only was he the greatest and definitive Joker performance of all time but probably the greatest villain performance in a film to-date. Literally everything about this film screams amazing. It hits all the right beats. There is a reason it is called the greatest superhero movie of all time. However I must admit the recently released Spider-Man No Way Home is certainly a challenger to that throne. All in all this movie is quite perfect and 99.9999% impossible to beat in relation to other Batman films.",

    "reviewBody": "Amidst the clamor there might always be a dissenting voice with a different perspective and one who climbed up to the top of the high risers to view this production perhaps a few dozen yards above the gargoyle-like, statuesque Caped Crusader.Here, banter about the nature of a criminal mind and sweeping sky flights and explosions replace story values and depth. Continuity is sacrificed for action. An over the top performance wild enough to be suspected for dope fueling by a now beloved, dead actor keynotes the scenario and etches deep into the psyche deep enough to be indelible and appears to bring glory to what is really an overblown, contrived production.Extreme cruelty and sadistic enterprise replace plot and hammer away the chain of promises of the story. Where in Batman Begins we had a fascinating account and worthy characterizations we now have unsupported, unfounded surprises with gaps in character development. The personality dysfunction is so extreme as to press painfully against the science of psychology and the logic of common sense.What is it that drives the audiences and critics so wild about this production where the budget soared to almost $200 million? In the annals of film history we were uplifted by life affirming values, the motives of true heroes and were rewarded by story somehow easing a small aspect of our tedious, sometimes painful, boring lives. Instead we now are treated to the Circus Maximus, the Flavian Amphitheater, blood, gore, and easy, cheap death. The film theater critics rave and drool. Bob Kane simply turns, uncomfortably in his grave.",

    "reviewTitle": "The dehumanizing product of a morally stunted culture",
    "reviewBody": "I know people will hate me for giving this movie 2 stars, but allow me to explain why the rating is deserved. I watched this movie twice and my initial impression of it was confirmed on the second viewing. The tagline of the movie is \"Welcome to a world without rules.\" But even someone who likes the movie must realize this is absurd, because the rules of the film are strictly defined from the start. Batman is PERFECT GOOD, and the Joker is PERFECT EVIL. Whenever it's the cops versus Batman in this movie, we know the cops are wrong and Batman is on the side of good. He's just that good. And the Joker is so evil that he doesn't even have a motive. He's there to create a force of perfect chaos which Batman is duty-bound to fight.To deny that this movie is about terrorism is to deny the well-executed thrill elements such as the videos released to the press and closed-circle moral tests (on the ferries; similar to United 93). These are borrowed directly from the terrorist playbook, and one persistent element, the ticking time-bomb scenario which Batman solves by brutally beating people up until he gets the information he wants, is derived from our fear of terrorism even though ticking time-bombs NEVER happen in real life. When you compare the movie to reality, though, an outrageous discrepancy is made evident. Terrorists are not born psychopaths like the Joker. They are poor, scared people driven to violence only by persistent reinforcement of hatred and duty. That's WHY there are no ticking time-bombs: true psychopaths do not act like the Joker, and terrorists are not true psychopaths.In this movie, the only mistake Batman makes is when he injures himself swerving his motorcycle so that he doesn't kill the Joker. He is just too good to kill his enemy. Three thousand years of storytellers are laughing themselves to tears in Heaven at our image of a hero. Read Shakespeare. Read the Iliad. See if you can figure out for yourself what kind of travesty this is.The areas where this film deviates from standard superhero crap only condemn it further. Batman creates a magical cell phone network, which his buddy says a violation of privacy; the film makes his buddy out to be a spineless coward, because Batman needs his magic to do good. Do you see the problem here? Here it is: Batman doesn't exist in real life.To call this movie the best film of the year, or, as IMDb currently reckons it, the best film of all time, is to admit that we want to believe in a world where good battles evil. It creates a worldview where \"good\" people will not have to admit their own problems, and \"evil\" people can be rounded up and beaten half to death without any moral qualms. It is EXACTLY this kind of mentality which has caused the war in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay.I award this movie eight stars for execution, but subtract five stars for its incorrect, dehumanizing, and morally stunted outlook on human nature. Thus, it ends up with three stars, which I think is more than generous.",

    "reviewTitle": "Excellent superhero movie",
    "reviewBody": "Batman (Christian Bale) hits the streets again with his most famous foe, the Joker (Heath Ledger) as his foe. Where the first film in Nolan's new series expressed basically the problems with Batman's double life, this new film focuses (to whatever it extent the film can be said to have focus) on the effect that he has on the criminals themselves and the culture of \"Gotham City.\" The most successful and surprising aspect of the film is the way that it truly makes the audience believe by the end that anything could happen (i.e. one of Gordon's kids could really die), as opposed to most superhero movies where the outcome eventually becomes obvious if not tedious. Ledger's performance is also a huge factor in the film's quality. He's really scary, not over the top at all in a bad way.My problems with the film remain some of the same problems from \"Batman Begins.\" I think Bale is sort of a dull Batman, primarily because he's not really convincing as Bruce Wayne. Specifically his version of Bruce Wayne is so cool and composed that it would seem obvious to everyone that he's Batman, whereas Michael Keaton for example seemed like such a doofus at times in the Bruce Wayne persona that you could believe that people would assume he was too much of a dilettante even if they did suspect him a bit. Believability is strained, even within the context of a superhero film, when Wayne slips away from his party and then moments later replaced by Batman, and yet nobody suspects.One thing I also liked about the Burton films was that Nicholson's Joker was both funny and terrifying, whereas I noticed all the jokes that Nolan tried to pull with Ledger's Joker came off flat. The dark atmosphere of the film is so unrelenting that the audience does not really feel inclined to laugh, and that produces an effect that dulls the overall edge of the action scenes. I tend to prefer superhero films that take themselves less seriously, yet this one was so well done in its own style that I would actually rate it higher than \"Iron Man\" for example despite the fact that the latter was actually more my type of movie. You just can't ask me to take crimefighters in capes and armored suits seriously for 2 plus hours, but this movie actually came amazingly close.Halfway through the movie I was thinking that it really wasn't any better than \"Batman Begins\" which I thought was somewhat mediocre, but then Ledger's performance really hits the high gear. I loved the dialog scene between Joker and Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) in the hospital and the bit with him walking out. Also Batman and Joker in the interrogation room was a very strong scene. The really scary possibility that Ledger's performance raises is the possibility, perhaps only glimpsed, that the Joker might actually be more sane than Batman or even more sane than the average \"civilized\" person. \"I'm just ahead of the curve\" he says, and we almost want to believe him. These \"supervillains\" spring from essentially the fertile ground of Lon Chaney's performances in films such as \"The Penalty\" in 1919, where he was a legless criminal mastermind who wanted revenge on the entire city of San Francisco -- yet Ledger takes it to still another level by doing an irrational, anarchic take on the idea. He actually recites various versions of his invented \"backstory\" to his victims as if to mock their desire to contextualize his behavior through some rational explanation i.e. \"my father beat me\", \"my mother didn't love me.\" The concept of revenge or even psychological compensation is just another joke to him. If indeed he is \"insane\", his ego will not allow him such a luxury and his very purpose seems to be to deny us the consolation of a rational or formulaic explanation for his brutality.I wasn't disappointed with the film at all -- this is basically as good as this type of thing gets. It wasn't a truly great film like Nolan's \"The Prestige\", but I didn't really expect it to be. I did notice some of Nolan's trademarks like the repetition of certain sounds and images in different contexts. I'm very excited by the possibilities for Nolan's next couple movies because this one is such a big hit that he basically has a blank check.",

    "reviewBody": "C'mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger's last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I've just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. \"The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham,\" is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can't Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a \"civilized\" manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn't give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes \"Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids,\" and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan's vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman's theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out.",

    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a big and bold production. The great special-effects, sharp editing and affecting score sweep the film into a high-entertainment package. It is a vast improvement on Batman Begins reaching a higher level of storytelling. Although there are self-evident inadequacies in the script this is a breakthrough film. The Dark Knight is a long film, and in this respect it surprisingly fails somewhat to provide enough depth. Instead we do get scenes where the obvious ineptitude of the police enable the plot to continue as it wishes. For example, why is a police officer in the same cell as The Joker when it was entirely unnecessary? It therefore sometimes falls more into a comic book experience conflicting unfortunately with the superior film elements. However,if this can be forgiven (as I have) Nolan has produced a successful cross-over from his somewhat comic book feature of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is stunning as The Joker providing the emotional context and thrills. The set-pieces are as grand as they are gripping.A minor point, which I could not get away from was a particular moment when Bale is discussing gadgets with Freeman, was this just me or did anyone else feel like we were watching a James Bond and Q moment?The Dark Knight is a breakthrough film it is more majestic and gripping than any of its Batman predecessors. It is a superior film of entertainment only hampered by its over long-running time but ultimately it is a triumph.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best film ever? You must be batty!",
    "reviewBody": "Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. I'd have thought that a man of dent's resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.I really don't think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledger's performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didn't try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is exceptional, and I would not change a thing about it. With superhero movies, it is very easy to just make generic heroes fighting dumb villains and still make a movie people will like. However, the best superhero movies make heroes somewhat realistic characters that you can root for, with villains that morally oppose them without seeming ridiculous. This movie absolutely nails its characters, and the dichotomy between the Joker and Batman is perfect, masterfully representing the best of heroes that you want to win and villains that you love to watch.This movie has everything going for it: you are invested in all of the characters and there are stakes associated with each one. You do not expect Rachel to be killed and you can feel the characters pain and the weight of her death. You feel bad for Harvey Dent's decline into chaos because you see his good heart corrupted in front of you. The joker has his best portrayal in any media, being completely unpredictable, extremely calculated, very intimidating, and totally enjoyable to watch all at the same time. If the characters aren't good enough, you can also talk about the stellar writing, directing, cinematography, plot, or pretty much any aspect of this film. Truly an epic movie that is more than just the stereotypical super hero flick.",

    "reviewBody": "First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created.And to tell the truth, i wasn't entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one.Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone.

    "reviewTitle": "Why So Serious? When You Can Smile Because The Dark Knight Is Here And Because It Is Fantastic",
    "reviewBody": "When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burton's Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with that tape), a 1989 film that I haven't watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for Jack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker makeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack Nicholson about the \"new\" joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he should have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I saw The Dark Knight, on a midnight \"special\" screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories of Nicholson's joker, I really don't remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledger's joker on the screen; he is absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolan's Batman, the second take and definitely my favourite of all the Batman films. Ledger's joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are just waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is the joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of Gotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement (the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one in who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City but at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in this way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since I only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of Gotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And the joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable in the film; I loved that the joker's origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and maybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is not very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level \"regular\" persons and he succeeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because of his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation. On this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty and the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I write before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write before too, the joker's movements are just to follow and even we you don't expect anything he puts to the civilians the clown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is kind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all the performances in this film with only one word: great (I didn't missed Holmes and I'm glad that Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again).The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the unique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the first minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight screenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and that there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer. I'm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film ever. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly fantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Don't miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!",

    "reviewTitle": "Are you kidding?",
    "reviewBody": "To think that this movie belongs in the top 100 movies of all time let alone the top five is ludicrous. You bet, it' quite a spectacle. But spectacle doesn't make a great movie. There's one truly great character and everyone knows it's Heath Ledger's Joker. That was a magical paring of great writing and great acting.But what happened to the rest of the movie? Besides The Joker the film is merely almost good. That is if you like exceedingly dark and depressing movies that have little if anything to feel good about. It's mildly suspenseful at times but much of the action is telegraphed. Let's see some more stupid police who can't see another Joker getaway coming from a mile away.I'm no wimp -- I can be engrossed by and accept wholesale carnage when it's in something like \"Saving Private Ryan\" -- but this is yet another movie in which it doesn't matter how many faceless civilians and police die just as long as there can be lots of shooting and car crashes and the stars are OK.And what of poor Batman? Christian Bale does a creditable job in the role, yet this is really a movie about The Joker. The hero and who he is isn't nearly as well explored as the villain.Besides Ledger the two old pros, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, play the most interesting characters. Gary Oldman does a decent job as James Gordon. The problem is we're never given any reason to doubt him yet there is this undercurrent to the character that maybe he's not really working for the good guys.The scene where Batman hunts The Joker as SWAT teams come crashing into the building is one of the most confusing messes I've seen. There's no clear idea what's happening and why and The Joker's final capture is anticlimactic. The turn to the dark side by character Harvey Dent is poorly developed and in the final scenes, lacking much logic. And the suspension of logic -- especially when it comes to the evil doing of The Joker -- just goes too far.In the end, despite Batman's expected saving of the child, the movie simply peters out with a muddled message and Batman zooming off on his motorcycle in the direction of -- we can only presume -- another sequel.If you want a dark, action-packed film then see \"Quantum of Solace.\" It's not a great film -- not nearly as good as \"Casino Royal\" -- but it's a fair shot better than \"The Black Knight.\"",

'The Dark Knight' is a treat for a cinema lover, I was gripped, Stunned and Amused to see such a great film. Its the highest grossing film after Titanic, in my opinion it deserves to be at no.1.Performance Wise: Heath Ledger will live through his portrayal as The Joker. Giving him any award, can not be as high as his performance. He's fantastic. His performance ranks among the best in the History of Cinema. Bale as Batman is stupendous. Aaron is outstanding as Harvery Dent and even as the short-lived two-face. Maggie is good. Sir Michael Caine is amazing as Alfred. Gary Oldman is a legend, he's fab. Morgan Freeman is tremendous. Others also excel.'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film ever made. Cinema is proud to have a film like The Dark Knight. Two Thumbs Up!",

To me The Dark Knight is one of those examples that will be remembered for a very long time to come. Everything that has been said about how wonderful this film is is true.The action is massive and beyond epic. But in-between the high flying punches and explosions its the acting that sums up this mastery. All the actors prove their worth as masters of their profession.Christian Bale has characterised the greatest Batman ever. His portrayal as Batman is brilliant and we finally witness this characters struggles, ambitions and morales all onto screen for the first time.Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is so chilling and monumental, menacing and pure that no other actor could had pulled that off. His presence on screen lights up and your left with, what i consider to be the greatest performance by any actor.To conclude, The Dark Knight is a perfect film. Perfect in a sense that i think has never been seen before and that wont ever be seen again.R.I.P Heath Ledger",

    "reviewTitle": "A Batman Movie?",
    "reviewBody": "Anyway, I finally got round to seeing The Dark Knight and, given the overwhelming and fanatical praise the movie has engendered, a rather negative critical evaluation which pours cold water on the mass hysteria seems a bit pointless. Because what do I know? But here goes anyway!So let's confine ourselves to a couple of observations that might give the adoring fans some food for thought.The plot, whilst completely linear, and in fact, rather banal, was confusingly laid out, and not because Nolan was trying for anything enigmatic or even thought provoking; simply it was a tale not very well told. Muddying up a plot, especially one so basic, is not the mark of a clever movie, simply a poor one.The fight scenes were likewise confused and consequently rather uninvolving. And somebody must have been on a bonus to see how many shots of the back end of the \"Batcycle\" could be included in the final cut.POSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTPOSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTBut the real surprise for me was the misuse - and I think it is misuse, however deliberately it was conceived - of the central character of Batman.Batman was essentially a bystander in his own movie. He didn't really seem to do anything, other than swan off to Hong Kong, a sub plot that seemed to be taken from a another movie altogether.Harvey Dent was the protagonist of this film and The Joker the antagonist.Batman was seemingly cast adrift, totally peripheral and rather ineffective. It seemed to me that everyone's destiny was settled without much help from Batman, and even the Joker achieved pretty much what he wanted to do.I'd almost go as far to say that if the movie had done away with Batman and had been rewritten as a straight crime procedural, it would have been a better movie. Now Nolan and his buddies obviously know what they wanted to achieve, which is fair enough. I am just surprised with the impression I was left with.Still as I said at the beginning, I am really the wrong person to critique this film. I was cajoled into going and I thought, well it will probably be OK. And, being kind, that is just about what it was.",

    "reviewBody": "I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didn't. Maybe I just don't get it? I'm not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I don't like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isn't the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesn't like planning (because he's too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesn't, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didn't like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this.",

    "reviewTitle": "Convoluted plot and lack of humor sinks overlong exercise in self-indulgent nastiness",
    "reviewBody": "Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop—they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop). After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the one's who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face\".The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum—that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.",

    "reviewBody": "One has to sit through a lot of idiocy in this sado masochistic wet dream in order to glean some exciting moments as this loud bombastic endless piece of highly polished garbage bashes it's way to a sequel. Given the running time there are plenty of thrills and chills that more or less simply repeat themselves for the last hour by which time it becomes a race between losing interest or your hearing.Gotham City is in danger of being picked clean by the mob. Only crusading DA Harvey Dent and Inspector Gordon stand between them. Enter the Joker, a sadistic yukster who can't get or deliver enough mayhem to all concerned. Even Batman has his hands full with the cruel overly optimistic and principled (it ain't about the money) bad Bozo. Now the stage is set to destruct much of the city, kill and injure much of the populace and give the Joker every opportunity to escape.Batman has always walked a fine line between fantasy and gritty realism (sci fi meets noir) that I felt succeeded when the tone was light. But this follow-up to Batman Begins allows even more darkness to seep in. The caped crusader is even more conflicted this time around since he's still sweet on his ex, now the DA's girlfriend. Then there is the impervious Joker. Still the energizer bunny to punishment he bounces back like a Joe Palooka doll no matter how bad the beating. After all if you kill him, you maim the sequel. The mirthful maniac, so crucial to keeping the train running is simply replaced by another less resilient villain.As Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale displays an ambiguous menace. As Batman he exchanges boiler plate philosophies (sprinkled with Bush administration policy) with cops and crooks sounding as if he has severe emphysema. It's hard to say if it's Heath Ledger or the make-up that makes him so ominous. Certainly the most sadistic Joker to date he lack's Nicholson's breezy take and better cosmetics as well as TV Joker Caesar Romero's boundless comic energy. But even with an Uncle Fester intonation he is a disturbing and convincing example of the fearless nihilist.Director Chris Nolan pours the chaos and carnage on like syrup with sensorial disregard. There's a well edited bank heist at the beginning of the film and Batman gets to tool around Gotham in a really cool motorcycle (Bat cycle?) but the biggest budget on earth (this may well have been) cannot disguise the fact it it is an inferior work to his gripping and imaginative Memento. Like another Indy phenom Steven Soderbergh he has chosen to sell out (Who can blame him, who wouldn't want a piece of the film gross?) to make bloated shiny movies that make a lot of noise and cash. The Hollywood moguls gain is the art house loss with this one time original filmmaker.The evolvement of Batman from the unique comic book crime fighter to the satirically brilliant TV show to the mega monster super film franchise has gone through many transformations to date. From the record breaking box office returns most would agree that it's for the better. Call me sentimental but it will never improve over the comic I would read twice while sitting under the maple tree in my yard and then trade even up with my friends for a Flash or a Green Lantern. Loud as this slick and crass masterpiece of marketing is it will never deliver the bang for the buck that the pages of the comic fed my imagination without all the noise.",

    "reviewBody": "A daring bank heist kicks open the second Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Continuing on the path provided in the Batman Begins, The Dark Knight balances itself between reality and comic book fantasy. The action certainly is from the comics in the way of realism, but the style is nothing but gritty realism, but even that it seems to do in steroids, which is not a bad thing.As some other reviewers have stated, this movie is not about the Batman (Christian Bale), but the Joker (Heath Ledger), who is not given a similar birth story like he was in Tim Burton's Batman film, but who just enters the room, so to speak, and is utterly insane and fascinating in his own deadly way. In fact I was mesmerized how little Ledger resembled anything I'd seen him before this. I wasn't looking at an actor, I was looking at the Joker, ripped from the pages of the comic books and thrown on the screen in his full insanity intact.The second criminal in the tale is Twoface, aka Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's a district attorney of Gotham city, who has a transformation of his own in the tale, all thanks to Joker's twisted little games.The Dark Knight is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The story twists and turns in every way, but it manages to keep in tact better than some films with simpler lines. Well chosen actors mixed with good score, well woven plot, stunning cinematography and breath taking action makes The Dark Knight one of the best films to come out in ages.",

I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson.

    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan returns with The Dark Knight, his second entry in the post millennial Batman franchise. Christian Bale returns as a more anguished, morally ambiguous Batman than before. Morgan Freeman returns as Luscious Fox, Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, and Michael Caine once again is Alfred. All actors shine in their supportive roles, especially Oldman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel Dawes and is OK in the role but nothing more. Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent/Two-face in a great visual parallel to the film's theme of moral ambiguity and the duality of man. Heath Ledger as the psychotic joker becomes the catalyst forcing each of the righteous men to act for good or ill: Batman, Harvey Dent, and Gordon. Ledger's performance is as good as advertised. The action, acting, art and set direction, cinematography, dialog, and direction are all first rate. The film builds to a different kind of climax, reminding us that fate plays a role in influencing our lives, and we must adjust to survive. This is a terrific action film for adults with several contemporary parallels that are a little uncomfortable at times. There are a few drawbacks, such as how the joker seems to pull everything off without a hitch off camera. The Bond-like moments and the obnoxious flip comments made by Nicky Katt in the S.W.A.T. van during the chase under the Chicago loop are serious detractors from an otherwise outstanding super hero movie. The brief appearance by scarecrow served what purpose? This appears in IMDb's top 5 of all time? I think that says more about today's audiences and less about the film. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

    "reviewTitle": "dark, daring, and dynamic",
    "reviewBody": "The hype has been OTT, but for once it is justified. 'The Dark Knight' is all you've been led to believe, and more. Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, the vigilante looking after the streets of Gotham by night, and this time he has a new and dangerous foe, The Joker (played by Heath Ledger, of more later). This nemesis takes the Batman series into chilling territory, far beyond the bam! bang! of the old 60s series with Adam West. It's never been quite this dark before.Is this a film for under-twelves, as the British certification suggests? Absolutely not. For a start, it is wordy, with an intelligent script and involving characters, which might get little ones fidgeting. Then there is the violence - mostly implied, but unpleasant and set to give shivers down the spine nonetheless. You see some gore and through jarring music, sound effects and shaky video footage you can imagine a lot more. The worst thing in marketing this film to a young audience is glorifying knife killing, if you view a psychopath as a hero.Bale is OK, a little dry as Bruce Wayne, but more than adequate. Michael Caine reprises his role as Alfred and is not bad at all, although someone prepared to do another accent might have been interesting. Maggie Gyllenhaal is slightly annoying as Rachel, but since her character isn't there to do much, it doesn't really matter. And Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman are solid in support as Harvey and Gordon.Back to Heath Ledger. The publicity surrounding his performance in this has reached ridiculous heights due to his early death at the beginning of the year, but he really does steal the film and pull off an amazing performance as a truly nasty villain who manages to be comic in the blackest of ways as well. Whether walking away from a blazing hospital in a nurse's uniform with a detonator that keeps jamming, or taunting police officers from the floor of a jail, or standing in the path of a motorbike bellowing 'Hit me' his performance is absolutely electric and by far the best thing about this film.Could another actor have made the same impact? I doubt it. And that's what gives 'The Dark Knight', for me, the edge over other blockbusters this year. Seen on IMAX screens, it is also mind-blowing in its effects and scope.",

    "reviewBody": "Ledger is irresistibly interesting in his portrayal of the Joker despite the somewhat hackneyed plot, and his performance saves the film from disaster. Without his performance I would have walked out as the rest of the film was trite, melodramatic, garbage.Christian Bale gives wood a bad name as he soullessly meanders through the role. The guttural growling he performs as Batman may make sense to the plot but its almost unbearable to listen to .The previous film with Bale a beaten down outcast and a man struggling for an identity was infinitely more interesting from an acting perspective than this film. Bale feels trapped in the role in this film going through the motions and he seems bored and unchallenged almost not knowing what to do with it. The plot also doesn't have the structure of the previous film. There was a appreciable beginning, middle, and end of the previous film that let things percolate, the action build, the plot be exposed.This film is too evenly paced and like an unstructured watercolor the plot runs together and gets lost somewhere along the line.(or maybe I just lost interest) I remember seeing a scene with the Joker in a nurses costume, and while the character was interesting not knowing or caring at that point why the Joker was blowing the place up. The Two-Face character was fairly weak, the emotions in the wronged Harvey Dent seemed forced and the plot explanation of his 'do-gooder' gone wrong personality seemed ham-fisted. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not a particularly interesting character and there were no fireworks between her and either Bale or Eckhart. Michael Caine almost seemed to be biting his lips to spit out the lines in the film. He seems to be almost embarrassed to be in the film. Acting wise the highlights are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger who you never doubt 100% inhabit their parts and actually add something positive to the film.Unfortunately they are fighting an uneven script, a hackneyed story, and bad acting from Bale and others the whole way.The result is an uneven, and eventually uninteresting film that relies on constant action and superficial delights to offset the uneven acting and flat out bad plot. Certainly inferior to its predecessor and without Ledger would have been an outright disaster. I feel a bit alone on this analysis and I am surprised as anyone about this as I was expecting greatness when I went into the theater. But thats the way the cookie crumbles.",

It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters.OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledger's death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. 'Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolan's new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten.This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really don't know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven).Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I don't bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: 'Arigato, arigato!'- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Disappointing Continuation",
    "reviewBody": "Where did it all go wrong? Unfortunately all the hype turned out to be exactly that. Just hype. This is a mediocre and highly repetitive film, perhaps marginally better than average action movie. It certainly is a major improvement over the recent mess that was The Hulk, but that's not saying much. Then again, even The Hulk managed a little better in the character department for its first third, before devolving into mindless dross.They seem to have forgotten the things that made the first of the new Christian Bale Batman movies a success (In more than just box office). Dark Knight is a bloated misshapen mess of a film, with little coherent structure. From it's rather lacklustre opening to it's weak finale, we are just treated to a variety of scenes that just seem to have been lumped together. At 152 minutes, someone needed to seriously take the editing scissors to the negative. Then again, if the fat had been trimmed from this film, there wouldn't be much left. The first film worked, because we had different locations, an interesting back story, and some genuine character moments, that all came together to make the 'action' parts enjoyable. Because they had a reason for being, and we became invested in what happened to the characters.Dark Knight is simply a collection of action scenes, and 'Joker' scenes for the sake of it. Heath Ledger is serviceable as the Joker, but it's by no means an Oscar worthy performance. Jack Nicholson at least had a certain level of theatricality to make the character work, in Burton's Batman. Though in Heath Ledger's defence, he had very little to work with, character-wise. I think he did the best he could with it, despite lots of pointless 'Joker-giggling' and 'oh, look, I'm insane' expressions. There are virtually no meaningful character moments in the film, no real structure to the story, and so there is no emotional involvement in the action. The fight scenes seemed to lack any genuine sense of threat or risk, because it never felt like Batman was ever in danger. In the previous film, he was fighting people of equal training and skill, so you felt he was having to struggle to defeat his enemy. In Dark Knight, he's simply going through the motions. And any genuine threat in the violence is shied away from. Don't believe the other reviews. There's plenty of 'action' in this film, but not a lot of 'violence' as such. Which isn't always a good thing. It may keep it child-friendly (in a way) for the most part, but leaves us with no real sense of consequence or risk.In terms of setting, this time around they decided to film mostly on real city locations. The idea being, that this will make the atmosphere more realistic. Unfortunately this works against it. The ever so slight fantasy feel of Gotham in the first film, helps us as the viewer, to dwell in their reality and accept the fantastical parts. By bringing this new film more into the world of everyday reality, the more outlandish elements become less believable than they might have otherwise been, thereby resulting in a detachment from events, rather than drawing us in.Morgan Freeman is poorly used, with little to get his teeth into. While perhaps he did not have a large part in the previous film either, he was at least imbued with some sense of personality and a genuine feeling of necessity to the plot. Michael Caine fairs a little better, and is one of the few characters to maintain a reasonable level of personality and purpose, that is on a par with his character in Batman Begins.As for the Harvey Dent character, Aaron Eckhart is simply adequate, but apart from his general role as the District Attorney, his evolution into the 'Two Face' villain feels utterly superfluous and tacked-on for the sake of cramming in another temporary antagonist. Though admittedly, he has stunningly well executed CGI enhanced make-up. (unfortunately the un-shrivelled eye ruins the effect, since it simply would not have likely survived the wounds, and even if it had, would dry up and wither, without its surrounding tissue, eyelids and moisture.) He is supposed to be some sort of example about how evil can change and affect even the best of people, but it all feels clumsily executed and poorly resolved.So what's good? Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes, brings her character some much needed depth. She's a more mature actress, both in style and looks, than Katie Holmes was (As the same character in the previous film). She also has a rather sad and tired appearance, which keeps her from looking like the typical overly-pretty female love-interest. She felt like a character that you could imagine he had grown up with and loved for herself, rather than simply an attractive face.To be honest, that's about the best that can be said, in comparison to the previous film. And in it's own right, it is a movie that can best be described as an enjoyable distraction, with virtually nothing to remember once you walk out. Sadly, this is very much another forgettable summer blockbuster. What makes it so disappointing is not that it is actually that bad, but simply that it should have been so much better, and certainly does not live up to the hype.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Superhero Masterpiece...",
    "reviewBody": "I don't think there has ever been a more powerful superhero film made to date that equals the greatness of The Dark Knight. Simply put, one must see this film.Even had someone not heard of the amazing portrayal of the Joker by the late Heath Ledger from the numerous high praise, they would still be flabbergasted at his incredible performance. Besting the choice of Christian Bale as Batman, Ledger is quite possibly the soul of this film, as each time his character makes an appearance, the room will go quiet and your heart will sink, pondering what he will do next.The story is basically Batman fighting the advancement at what seems to be an inevitable anarchy brought on by the Joker's ever-evolving mind. Harvey Dent -- the soon-to-be Two-Face -- James Gordon, and Batman each resemble a point on the morality spectrum, and as the plot continues to unfold, one must question what will happen to our heroes. Making this fantasy grounded to reality.There's hardly any CGI in this film, where it would be used is sometimes hard to be seen. The vast majority of the action and scenes are filmed with live everything. A brazen but ingenious choice by Christopher Nolan. Well done... well done.Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provide a similar sound from Batman Begins, in that a lot of the themes used in that film have been incorporated here. There's a few new bits of music in here, such as the Joker's theme and a rousing battle cue.Overall, The Dark Knight is everything one could hope for in a superhero film. This is a dark film, probably not viewable for a child under 10 for the wicked left side of Dent's face once he has become transformed. With the ending, one can only pray to the heavens that Nolan will do a third, and pick up where we left off.",

    "reviewBody": "Forget all the hype of it being the best film ever and it being the best film of 2008 and Heath Ledger being fantastic. None of these things are true. Yes the film is good, bordering on very good. But that's it, no way is it as great as everyone is making out. Let's start at the beginning the story, the story is just not involving enough, there's a power struggle between gangsters and Batman/the police, the Joker offers to kill Batman in exchange for half the gangsters money. The end. That's it? that's the whole story? Yeah, OK we have the relationship angle with Rachel and Harvey and Bruce but seriously what a ridiculously dull storyline. The action is good without ever being exciting or involving, personally I didn't care how many anonymous henchmen Batman fought with or how many faceless extras were put in danger by the Joker. This film needed a major face off between the two and that just didn't happen. As for Heath Ledger's performance, the characters name is called the Joker, clue is in the title, he just wasn't funny. I can't remember a single wisecrack in the whole film. Joe Pesci in Goodfellas is the perfect template of how to play the Joker - likable, hilarious with a serious threat of explosive violence. Heath just wandered about looking like a mad goth grumbling in a Richard Nixon voice. As for Harvey two face what really was the point in introducing him right at the very end of the film? a total waste of a character. Overall I feel slightly cheated by this film. It's not the fantastic movie I was expecting, it's an above average sequel. Nor is it up there with THE great superhero films Superman - The Movie and Superman 2, Spiderman and Spiderman 2. These are great superhero films, these set the benchmark way above whatever this can reach. An enjoyable film but not worthy of it's overblown status.",

    "reviewBody": "There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? It's still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and they're quite boring in the long run. Let's go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman he'll never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. I'm so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, there's the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. It's not entertaining, it's not disturbing, it's just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Let's talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. That's really sad, and you know what else? It's all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before it's release. sad. Really sad. I didn't like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still.",

    "reviewBody": "It is a good movie. It is not a great movie. After all of the hype I was a bit disappointed. I enjoyed the movie but thought it was just a run of the mill superhero action flick. The performances were good. All of the actors were believable and Heath Ledger's Joker was a great character but it was a one note performance. There was no real depth to the character for me. Each time he appeared he acted in the same psychotic manner but there wasn't an exploration as to why he was doing what he was doing or where he planned to take the story. The story was just a simplistic hatred of Batman and a want to unmask him. Sorry, same old, same old. Superhero movies suffer from clichéd story lines. Superman in each movie will be exposed to kryptonite. Profess his unfulfilled love for Lois Lane, (why I don't know. She is usually portrayed as some skinny, ambitious harpy), and is eventually saved from the bad guy by some babe. Spiderman yearns with unfulfilled love for his girlfriend and fights off some bad guy while reminiscing again about his Uncle, who we get to see die again. Batman will struggle with his demons while fighting off another bad guy punctuated by corrupt cops and double crosses. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a fine actress and is attractive but she is not an outstanding beauty who would attract the Joker to her in lieu of all of the other babes in the room. It is not helpful when the script has to tell you that the character is beautiful. The character's looks should tell you she is beautiful. Monique Curnen was there to provide the corrupt cop. One of many. She was wasted. Give me something new and fresh. Not a new gadget but a new story line. Explore more than the obvious. This movie was a series of vignettes of action scenes and simplistic twists. There were way too many deus ex machina moments and the twists did nothing but provide excuses for more action scenes. SPOILER ALERT. The scene with the cop being goaded by the joker to beat him up was clumsily telegraphed. Gordan appearing again at the exact opportune moment rang false. Aaron Eckhart's accident and metamorphosis into Two-face was rushed and hardly used. It became more of a distraction from the main story of the Joker. The Joker's character could have been examined in more depth. As it was the ending felt like it was there only to provide grist for the sequel. Heath Ledger's unfortunate death, which added hype to the movie, also destroyed the ending of the movie. There was no closure. It seems more like coming attractions for the next movie. Don't get me wrong it was a fun movie but it is just a summer popcorn movie and not a wondrous masterpiece it is being touted as. See it, enjoy it and then forget it until the next installment.",

I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably would've given it a bit higher rating...if I would've reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesn't hold up as well outside of the movie theater with it's huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and could've done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie should've focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That would've been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasn't some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesn't emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I could've lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. There's really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, c'mon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. It's just too much. Too many things going on that don't really gel together. I guess I'm tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, I'll watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasn't any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesn't live up to the hype.",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman v/s The Joker",
    "reviewBody": "Finally the wait is over. Quite obviously, 'The Dark Knight' is THE most waited film of Summer 2008. It is indeed an exciting action film but, in addition, it does delve deeper than the common action movies. What really makes 'The Dark Knight' stand out is the writing (especially the dialogues which are clever, amusing and thought-provoking), performances and of course, it is the skilled Christopher Nolan's direction that puts it all together, telling an exciting story. It's got substance and the themes are well presented. This time Batman's character is a lot more complex as he's faced with contradicting situations of which he has to make a choices. The character is a good 'continuation' from the prequel (where he's just started with the new identity whereas now he faces the disadvantages and complexities of being Batman).While the writers deserve all the praise for brilliantly defining the characters, it is the actor's job to bring them to life and credit goes to Nolan for retaining most of the better actors of 'Batman Begins' (namely Bale, Freeman and the one and only Caine) and the new cast includes a host of great names like Eckhart, Gyllenhaal, Oldman and of course Ledger. Christian Bale excellently carries off Wayne/Batman. In my opinion, his Batman is much more convincing and intriguing than what Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney offered. Maggie Gyllenhaal is obviously a tremendous improvement over Katie Holmes (the worst thing in 'Batman Begins'). She maintains a great chemistry with Bale and Eckhart and is far from the typical damsel in distress. Aaron Eckhart is totally awesome and Gary Oldman, Eric Roberts and Michael Caine (always dependable) hold their own and do nothing short of a great job. A barely recognizable Heath Ledger delivers a memorable last performance. He reminded me of the late Brandon Lee in 'The Crow'. His Joker is menacing, wickedly funny, insane and cunning. I especially liked that he always said that he didn't plan anything (when this was clearly a lie).The energy-filled action scenes are plentiful and well executed. The dramatic sequences are well balanced and convincing. The cinematography and sound effects are very effective and the score works fantastically.The only downers for me were that the pace wasn't steady as it gets slightly slow towards the end. Bale's Batman voice was overdone. I can understand that the voice needed to sound different from Bruce Wayne's but this one sounded too awkward and too artificial. I would have liked to see how Rachel's death affected Batman. Nolan demonstrates well how it influences Harvey but not much of how Batman dealt with it (especially since it was the consequence of a choice he made). Yet, overall, it is a very well executed film that is darkly entertaining and exciting. I can understand why so many love it.",

But the problems weren't really with the acting -- they were with the totally unrealistic way the plot evolved.

Then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos.

    "reviewTitle": "One of the best films of 2008!",
    "reviewBody": "Comic book movies as we know them are over. Gone are the special effects laden cartoons like \"The Incredible Hulk\" and \"Fantastic Four.\" Consider this the \"official\" death of a movie like \"Superman Returns\" which was beyond terrible. \"The Dark Knight\" redefines the comic book movie and changes all the possibilities of where superheroes go and what they're capable of.There should be no doubt that the driving force in this film is the ever maniacal Joker. I wouldn't doubt the fact that he's probably going to go down as the greatest comic film villain of all time after being portrayed so brilliantly and effortlessly by the late Heath Ledger. The Joker never fails to deliver the most diabolical and sinister games that force all the film's heroes to have to make sometimes painful choices. In his own words, \"I'm an agent of chaos.\" Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) realizes that to stop the Joker he has to become something he swore never to be. This results in an interesting turn of events that really can't be put into words, but I will tell you it involves a chase scene.The film really crosses the line in terms of the traditional comic book film in it's exploration of human nature and raises implications on social, political, and moral levels. The last time I saw a movie with that many themes was the multiple Academy Award winning \"Children of Men.\" Personally, I've always felt films that use fiction to explore the current reality we live in or the ramifications of our decisions usually give us a cold, harsh, reality check. Christopher Nolan's screenplay and choice of dialog is more complex than any comic film, not to mention considerably more poetic. Gotham City let Batman operate without having to answer to the law. What happens when you give one man all the power? Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) explains, \"When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was considered a service.\" His girlfriend, who also happens to be Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), shoots back, \"Harvey! The last man to protect the Republic was named Caesar!\" A lot of these implications wouldn't be relevant if we weren't living in post 9/11 America, so I recommend you read up on something called Executive Unitary Theory to get the full effect of giving one man all the power.Apart of what made this film so hard hitting was the stellar performances. None of them were actors this time, they were actors who completely lost themselves in the characters they built, every one of which we come to care about. Lieutenant Jim Gordon's (Gary Oldman) promotion to Police Commissioner is well deserved. The movie also allows Oldman to take Gordon to new heights and really shows how Batman and Gordon are in this together, and Gordon as a character really comes of age.\"The Dark Knight,\" in the end, wasn't merely about good and evil. It was about the fight for Gotham, and showing the city's people that you could overcome evil with good. Early on someone mentions that Harvey Dent is Gotham City's \"White Knight.\" Dent is a handsome, well educated, elected official. The people paint the picture of him as this incorruptible force of good. Batman on the other hand, is a vigilante; a man who exists outside the law. People end up having more faith in Dent than Batman, but Dent fails. It's because Batman is there to take the fall that Dent, as a symbol, continues to thrive. People had faith in Harvey Dent and he fails. As Batman puts it, \"People deserve to have their faith rewarded, even if it means we have to hide the truth I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.\" This is what makes him the real hero, as Gordon puts it, \"He's Gotham's protector; our Dark Knight.\" This is one of the year's best films. Go see it now!",

    "reviewTitle": "Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, all hit it out of the park",
    "reviewBody": "I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole \"Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance\" hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real \"origin\" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are \"jokingly\" referenced that \"my dad did this, \"my wife did this\"), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than \"I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here\"). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the \"white knight\", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking \"say it isn't so\", and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure \"fun\" of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.",

    "reviewTitle": "I'll tell you why so serious",
    "reviewBody": "I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess.Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites.I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area.The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?",

Mid-point scenes of Harvey Dent character w/ Maggie Gyllenhall, scenes of Commissioner Gordon & cops etc. slowed movie down drudgingly with boring back-story- needed 20 minutes shaved off.2. Batman fight scenes had elbow jabs galore and looked like a blur.3. Choppy story editing in first half of movie swung from action scenes to modern high-rise scenes back and forth like a yo-yo. Felt like I was going up and down an express elevator- gave me a headache.4. Not enough Joker in first half. (see first aspect) 5. Two-face should've lived, but the special FX on him were overkill.6. The mayor, played by a too-young and effeminate looking actor with obvious mascara, looked ridiculous.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Total and Complete Disappointment",
    "reviewBody": "****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*** This movie is a monumental disappointment. I had seen all five of the previous Batman movies on the big screen, and I watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse. I hoped that this one would break the trend (and with all the raves surrounding Heath Ledger's \"great\" performance, I really thought it would), but it did not. This movie is so trite and so absurd, and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no Good vs. Evil anymoreas a matter of fact the movie closes with Batman himself being chased by the Gotham Police(!). And constantly throughout the movie Batman (now suddenly called \"The Batman\") is seen as being the reason behind all the murders, robberies, and destruction the Joker is perpetrating in Gotham City. By the way, Gotham City here does NOT at all look like the Gotham City that we know; it is Chicago pretending to be Gotham City, which is very boring. What happened to the stunning production design that Gotham City is supposed to have?!! As for Heath Ledger, he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie (when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke), but after that scene the Joker's energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart-aleck, philosophical killerand even downright boring. In an attempt to keep things entertaining with the Joker, the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurse's outfit (a cheap laugh). To make a quick comparison, \"The Dark Knight\" is very much like \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (and a million other movies) in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain, and like Die Hard 4 (When are needless sequels going to stop?!!!!) it tries to replicate the feel of 9-11a real-life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic-book stories like Batman. Batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film, as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before. But then again, why should he even try when everyone is calling him a \"vigilante killer\"? When I was eight years old and saw the first Batman movie at the theater in 1989, seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream-come-true. Had \"The Dark Knight\" been the movie that was released instead in 1989 (especially seeing Batman getting chased by the cops at the end), I would have been devastated. Now as an adult, I can honestly say I am disappointed.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's been said already but this is way overrated.",
    "reviewBody": "Well, this film is the most overrated movie I can remember but that doesn't mean it sucks at all. It's well made, with great shots and good acting (at least by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Heath Ledger). The action scenes are filmed more coherently than Batman Begins and that pencil trick was awesome.Still, there are too many ridiculous scenes (like flying out of a window with a cable attached to a plane and cell phones turning into radar machines) and completely unnecessary plot lines. Do I really care if Commissioner Gordon plays dead for half the film and his wife gets mad at him or some Chinese guy is hording the criminal's cash? No. Give us more confrontation between the hero and villain. Lastly, the dark themes this film deals with are taken a little too seriously for a movie about a superhero of sorts. He wears a cape and a mask and fights crime as a symbol... don't try and get me emotionally involved in any THEME greater than that. Develop the characters and make me care about them. The animated \"Batman and the Mask of the Phantasm\" did a better job with that.Whatev, i've rambled long enough. It's still a very enjoyable movie and if I see it again i'll probably like it more but there's no way this deserves all the praise it gets. I'd really give it a 6.5 out of ten but we can't do .5s and this definitely does not belong in the top movies of all time. Too bad because it might be worthy of a 7 or 8 had it not been hyped up like it was the gift of Zeus.",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman's War on Terror.",
    "reviewBody": "Ledger gives a powerful performance as the joker, but the rest of the movie was a bit out of focus. Surprisingly the movie revolves around Harvey Dent. \"The White Knight\" Unfortunately Eckhart was bland as Harvey Dent and his fall to the dark side was almost corny. Shame really as this was Harvey Dent's story rather than Batman's. Speaking of which, I have never seen Christian Bale act this poorly. The man is one of the greatest actors of his generation and now his performance was totally uninspired. The Batman voice is incredibly distracting and as Bruce Wayne he just sleepwalks through his scenes. I also noticed that he wasn't as buff as he was in Begins. In all honesty there wasn't much for him to do here though. The script simply doesn't give Batman much to do, other than fight and beat up people. Bruce Wayne is the billionaire Playboy and that's about it. Freeman and Cain virtually play the same character. They do it well but the cast is too bloated already so they don't get much screen time.Maggie Gyllenhaal was great. She was able to bring warmth to her portrayal of Rachel Dawes. But unfortunately we don't get to see much of her either.The philosophical themes in this movie are barely explored. Every hero turns into a villain? Or some such nonsense. Every firefighter will turn evil unless they die? Very shallow and laughable. Only Jokers nihilistic speeches were convincing. Every good hearted person either dies or gets horribly mutilated. And then turns to evil. Batman beats prisoners and brakes peoples legs. Why so violent? Then you have your boring action sequences, the mandatory car chases and numerous explosions. The Dark Knight is actually an action movie much like Die Hard. Only the nihilistic philosophy sets it apart and gives it a unique flavor. If you are a big action movie fan you'll probably enjoy this movie. The Dark Knight isn't as good as Batman Begins. Batman Begins was a character study. How a traumatized young boy became a hero and how he turned his anger and fear into something positive. Here we see the hero corrupted by Joker. He is violent and angry. No longer a hero. He is willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they couldn't handle the truth. This sends a dubious message.In fact this movie has way more propaganda than your average summer blockbuster. Invading privacy, torturing prisoners and lying to the public.... But It's cool cause it's Batman. Kids wanna be like Batman and therefore Batman is cool even while torturing prisoners. Dark Knight could be viewed as legitimizing Dick Cheney's War on terror. It's pretty disgusting. \"We have to work the Dark side...\"- Mr Cheney said after 911. Batman agrees.",

    "reviewBody": "When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber take, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the few and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for conquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation with his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, they're stuck in Sakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the next). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion – The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the role's vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos – albeit not far enough. It doesn't extend to properly exploring what he's been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was literally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The supporting players are appreciated, though).This trilogy has gotten a lot of criticism from the onset, some of it deserved, a lot of it borne out of the natural difficulties with making this kind of world work, especially within the gritty, realistic one Iron Man set up. In this entry, Earth is nearly completely absent, and certainly the only human who has screen-time is Dr. Strange, who is also \"beyond\". Yes, Jane Foster, Darcy and Erik Selvig are gone. Broken up off-screen. I hate that. However, with this newfound freedom, this goes full cosmic. The tone approaches Guardians of the Galaxy. It's superior to Vol. 2, but not up to the level of the original. Honestly, a few minor things seem to be there specifically to redo that, and they'd be better left on the cutting room floor. The jokey subversion/drama mix is not as strong as that, nor of the third Robert Downey Jr. solo picture. With that said, relatively little of the actual weight is lost to laughs. This still has gravity and tension. The action is fast, frequent and enjoyable, if also by far the most MCU aspect of this. Many will find this to be bland, not fun, a corporate product. Certainly, there's still a lot of room for diversity and flavor. Fingers crossed that Black Panther will push the envelope there.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. You can go into this completely blind. Stay through the credits. 8/10",

    "reviewBody": "This review of Thor: Ragnarok is spoiler free**** (4/5)LIKE CHANTING BETELGUISE'S name, for Marvel products the phrase third time's a charm really works, of course well-earned nods to brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo's Captain America: Civil War which accomplished all fears for its enchanting, eye-shattering Leipzig airport battle scene having the heroes involved showing what they can do, the standout there was Black Panther and the introduction of the newer, younger much improved Spider-Man. Then we had Shane Black's turn at Iron Man 3 which vastly improved on its predecessor. Now the third and final entry in the Thor series is one of the most ridiculous, most hilarious adventures Marvel has ever produced, it's essentially like eating a badger sandwich, and no we don't know what that is either. This daftness comes from none other than New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi, who over the last few years has created some of the most bizarre adventures ever told in cinema with his hilarious vampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows and secondly Hunt For The Wilderpeople which had a stunning performance from Sam Neill in a hat made from a collinder. However Thor: Ragnarok is his most ridiculous adventure yet.After Chris Hemsworth's Thor is hurled from the bifrost he's captured on a strange planet which from first glance is obviously the universe's trash can, under the rule of Jeff Goldblum's daft, yet tyrannical Grandmaster who looks like he just wears anything he finds in the 80s factory complete with a blue line under his lip and comes with a lot of Goldbluminess, he's funny as hell - he gives Thor the ultimate fight against his champion - Hulk's (Mark Ruffalo) welcome is really no surprise but comes with a roundhouse of applause particularly with the well-drawn hand-to-hand combat in a Star Wars-esque gladiatorial coliseum which can't escape Thor's scream of joy and a few quick-witted jokes to get you going. Meanwhile on the other side of the universe the Asghardians are held for a fight for their survival after a vicious attack from Cate Blanchett's goddess of death Hela looking a tad like Alice Cooper's twisted sister complete with a horned helmet for ferocity. Sadly her performance is the film's weakest point, she doesn't exactly come with Galadriel's strength or depth she's not Marvel's best villain, though a better improvement over Thor: The Dark World's Dark Elves. She's not in many scenes and when she does appear her delivery is often heavy-handed and empty with little feeling.The script penned by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost is an improvement over the previous instalment too - the funnier scenes are along the same lines as James Gunn's unadulterated joy for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, here there are arse gags and penis gags aplenty which is a vast improvement over the previous two films' barrier for serious face the actors are allowed to let loose here. Particularly the shared chemistry between Thor who hates having his hair cut, Hulk angry as ever and Tessa Thompson's surly Valkyrie who can't stop drinking yet comes with a humanizing story giving her performance some emotion. Yet there's humour to them too they each share their time with the whims and the jokes that the script has to offer, the three arguing in a room with an angry Hulk and a teamed final fight are obvious standouts. Sadly, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't come without its flaws it's not utterly thunderous throughout the last few minutes of the final fight are a little CG heavy there's a lot going on in a few shots it can be difficult to follow a certain point which watching in 3D can be on occasion daunting to the eyes. Though there is some goodness the CG images on show, here the destruction of Asghard though upsetting for the fans who have stayed with the series is thoroughly stunning plus this is the most impressive vision of Hulk yet, he's still a wonder to watch from the outrageous gladiatorial combat, through the hilarious jokes he lets free to the film's final fight he's relentless and utterly charming. This is vintage Waititi he is clearly at home here in the huge immersive worlds of space or the cramped space of Hulk's chamber he allows you to breathe with the world he has created here. The finale of the Thor series is one of the most intense, boldest adventures Marvel has ever created does it bring on the thunder? You're damn right it does.VERDICT Daft, ridiculous and hilarious Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour and goofball madness in this neon-infused 80s style finale.",

    "reviewTitle": "Welcome to the Marvel Cosmic Universe!",
    "reviewBody": "Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells you'd guess yourself after seeing the trailer, is that it's nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The tone is completely different. In fact it's probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with it's straight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvel's Cosmic Universe in full swing. How this makes me feel isn't quite so clear. As I said, I really didn't mind the other Thor movies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days, seems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and he's on top, What We Do in the Shadows form here.Ragnarok is jam-packed full of jokes and gags, and every single one of them lands with aplomb. From Thor asking Surtur to pause while he helplessly spins around at the beginning, to the Grandmaster declaring a tie in Sakaar's revolution, each and every slither of humour is guaranteed to earn a laugh. It's typical Waititi humour; awkward, modern, and using juxtaposition to great effect. Korg, a large being made of rocks, talking about his revolution failing because he didn't hand out enough pamphlets hits so hard because it's so against what you'd expect from that kind of alien.Waititi's also in his element with running jokes, coming into a franchise nearly twenty movies in full of continuity to adhere to, poke fun at, and address in one way or another. Loki taking Odin's place in Asgard is dealt with swiftly, with a couple of gags thrown in, including surprise cameos. Hulk disappearing at the end of Age of Ultron is addressed with heartbreak and a couple of touching moments between Thor and Hulk/Banner. And Hela knocking over the Infinity Gauntlet in Asgard's vault because it's \"fake\" was a great way to plug such a tiny yet significant plot hole.Despite how humorous Ragnarok is, it doesn't shy away from more serious themes and ideas though. Thor's companions in the Warriors Three are dispatched of quickly and without remorse, Hela raising an army of the dead from the Asgard crypts is a pretty dark idea, and of course there's the whole Ragnarok thing. Not only is this movie one of the funniest entries in the MCU, but it also has some of the biggest stakes so far. By the end of the film, Thor's life is permanently changed in a massive way. But Ragnarok is still not perfect. It still doesn't quite reach the heights of either of the Guardians movies or Winter Soldier. It's opening act feels a little messy, rushing through plot points to get to the meat of it. Thor's tied up in chains at the behest of Surtur, now he's in Asgard unveiling Loki, now he's with Doctor Strange looking for Odin, now he's in Norway bracing for Hela's arrival, now he's on Sakaar about to face the Grandmaster's champion. It's almost all rushed, and some of it feels pointless. Like, Doctor Strange's role is completely unnecessary. He's just put in for an Earthling presence in a movie that frankly didn't need it.Hela is also another in a long line of lacklustre MCU villains. She's the first female villain to pose as the main antagonist, which is great, and Cate Blanchett is perfect for her (I think I'm in love). She has an interesting backstory, but it's never really developed. Hela ends up just becoming another two-dimensional mustache- twirling villain with a plan that's flawed from the offset and no motivation beyond just being evil. Her being the Goddess of Death is never really capitalised on either, outside of her resurrecting dead soldiers of Asgard's crypts reasonably early on.That said, almost every other character is great. Thor's sense of humour is brought to the forefront with some surprisingly great comedic chops from Hemsworth, without it taking away from his more serious moments. He's still Thor despite the tonal shift around him. Likewise, Loki is the same old Loki, with his tricks and betrayals, and his history with Hulk is played up to perfection. Valkyrie and Skurge both enjoy character arcs that help to develop them, and both Tessa Thompson and Karl Urban make their mark on the movie. Waititi even gets to add some of himself into the movie as Korg, who promises to steal every scene he's in. And of course Mark Ruffalo manages to play Hulk completely by himself for the first time and gives us the best Hulk we've ever had.Ragnarok is another part of Marvel's current hot streak, and here's hoping it continues just a little bit longer at least. It's a massive tonal shift from the rest of the Thor franchise, feeling closer to the Guardians franchise, which is a win/lose depending on your point of view. The music is a step in the right direction, utilising Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song really well, as well as adding some 80's synth/video game music underneath Marvel's standard, dull strings arrangements, but it's largely still unmemorable and unremarkable. The visuals are fantastic, employing a style closer to Snyder's approach in the DCEU than Marvel's usual grey realism, which I personally consider a massive plus. But of course it's the humour that keeps Ragnarok afloat, and the massive stakes leave me begging to find out what happens next. I give Ragnarok a high 8/10. Easily the best Thor movie so far.P.S. Where was Sif?!",

    "reviewTitle": "RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?",
    "reviewBody": "There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.Thor: Ragnarok could've taken itself seriously in the good way, but rather than doing that, it didn't take itself seriously at all, unnecessarily so, and ended up becoming a good thing still, but in a bad way. It's weird and begs the question(s); Is Marvel bending to its fans' will, or is Marvel forcing its fans to bend to its will? Is Marvel being smart and trying to revolutionize Comic Book Cinema, or stupid, and completely losing the plot?Tension is one of storytelling's best and greatest tools, and Marvel seems to be slowly abandoning it, for another great tool, humour. However, is this Marvel's doing, or is it the fans/critics/audience? Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Serious, dark and amazing = $714 Million Box Office, 89% from critics and 7.8 IMDb. Guardians of the Galaxy: Colourful, silly, funny = $773 Million Box Office, 91% from critics and 8.1 IMDb. GotG beat TWS (even though TWS is a sequel, and sequels tend to do more, and, our first look at Steve after The Avengers) in every way according to numbers, but was GotG actually the better film? Batman Begins, Captain America: The First Avenger, Man of Steel and X-Men: First Class suffered similar fates.I love dark, serious, tense. Ragnarok is not that for the most part, but it's still a good watch. There is a lot that is good about this movie, like Thor and Loki's moment in the elevator, but there is also a lot that is bad too, like the fact that for 4 years we've wondered how Thor would react to Loki's impersonation/imprisonment of Odin, and what we got left much to be desired.I think Ragnarok took a very different approach here, and, because of Marvels appeal and reach, it maybe shaking something loose. Also, they could afford to take this route with Thor, as it is the least received franchise, so, they perhaps didn't have much to lose, and more/everything to gain.Ragnarok being this \"light\" also, could work very well for Infinity War, as long as IW is \"hella\" dark. The contrast maybe a very welcomed surprise.I will say this though, if Infinity War takes Ragnarok's path, it will undoubtedly, dismantle its opportunity of being a legendary classic, that has been 11 years and 18 movies in the making.Personally I think that at this point, it may be difficult to judge any MCU film by itself, because each installment is now telling the stories of something bigger, so when you factor that in, there maybe more to what meets the eye.Anyway, in the spirit of judging each on its own merit, Thor: Ragnarok; 7/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Recommended",
    "reviewBody": "​*THIS REVIEW'LL BE MOSTLY SPOILER FREE. I'LL TELL YOU BEFORE A SPOILER*'THOR: RAGNAORK' - 2017Directed by Taika_Waititi{Hunt for the Wilderpeople}Starring Chris_Hemsworth{In the Heart of the Sea}, Cate_Blanchett{Carol} and Tom_Hiddleston Kong: Skull Island}Plot_Overview: Imprisoned on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds himself in a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against the Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger. Thor's quest for survival leads him in a race against time to prevent the omnipotent Hela from destroying his homeworld and the Asgardian civilisation.So far, I've been disappointed by Thor's solo outings. The first was average at best and I consider The Dark World to be a quite frankly awful movie. Therefore, I had NO expectations going in and ignored the overwhelmingly positive reviews. But after watching it, I loved it. And while I don't agree that it's this legendary titan of cinema that some are declaring it as, I certainly think that it's a VERY fun and enjoyable way to spend a couple hours of your time. If you like superhero movies, be sure to check it out.What SPECIFICALLY is good about this film? The drastic change in tone and style is probably by biggest praise. For me, Thor's previous outings have been dull and monotonous chores to get through so the new focus on comedy was welcome to me. And thankfully a lot of the jokes hit bullseyes. I was laughing constantly throughout this movie; it was a genuine COMEDY.The action sequences in this movie were excellent and thoroughly entertaining. They were also, thankfully, well shot; like the rest of this movie. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is an excellently shot, edited and lit movie. Javier Aguirresarobe does an EXCELLENT job in shooting this movie. Combine this with the jaw dropping effects and 3D and you have one heck of a good looking movie.Chris Hemsworth was an actor I didn't like before. I've always thought he was very one note and had a limited range. This movie proves otherwise. Hemsworth does excellent in the action sequences of this movie, but also has an excellent sense of humour and fulfils the quota for a couple dramatic moments reasonably well. I commend the man for proving me wrong. Accompanying Thor is his quirky brother, Loki, as portrayed by Tom 'Hiddlesticks' Hiddlseton. Hiddlesticks was great in 'Thor', eh in 'Avengers Assemble', okay in 'Thor: The Dark World' and, I'm pleased to announce, great in Ragnarok. Hiddlesticks delivers his best performance of the year(screw Skull Island) and returns to form as the extremely charismatic Loki, that we all love to hate. Mark Ruffallo{Avengers Assemble} also co-starred. Granted, he is Hulk for the majority of the run time but for the moments he's not, he does a great job. Expanding on the decision to include Hulk, I liked it. They certainly give Hulk a lot more personality, and make him feel a lot more relevant to the plot, unlike in other movies. Hulk is now a CHARACTER, no longer a giant green monster that smashes stuff. But don't worry, he is still a good smasher. Tessa Thompson{Selma} also appears in the movie as Valkyrie. Thompson does a reasonable job as this character and succeeds in the action segments of the movie. Alas, I don't think she was that good in the more sombre moments, or at making jokes. Jeff Goldblum is my spirit animal. I love the man as an actor and I thought he was pitch perfect in this movie. He's one of the brighter spots of the movie, despite not appearing in it THAT much.As for issues, I unfortunately have a couple. Firstly, the story was very weak and the conclusion unsatisfying. The concept of 'Ragnarok' is a TERRIFYING idea, especially for the characters on screen. But it's not really that important to the plot. In fact, it's brought up at the start and then once more at the very end. So I don't really see the point in labelling the film as it. The actual story that we got was a very dull one. I wasn't expecting much but the story was so meaningless and pointless that I really wish more time was put into it. Furthermore, I also hated the conclusion of this movie. I was very disappointed about something. The thing I was disappointed about is TECHNICALLY a spoiler so if you have watched the movie, please read on. But if not, then please skip to the next paragraph from now!!!! Right, the thing that I wish happened but did not, was that I wish that Thor_would have been killed off. I know that may seem morbid but it's true. 'Ragnarok' means the end of everything, so what better of a way to have one of the movies that lead into Infinity War, have a main character die. It'd bring stakes back to this universe and give the Avengers something to Avenge. And I think it's be an EXCELLENT way to wrap this film, and Thor's saga, up.Okay, there are no more spoilers no so feel free to read on. My second major issue with this movie is Cate Blanchett and the villain. I understand that Marvel's villains aren't typically good, but even by their standards: this was pretty poor. Hela, who is the GODDESS OF DEATH, is the villain of this movie and guess what she does? Sit in corner for the entire movie and contribute NOTHING to the plot. There was no point to her being there. In fact, I believe this film would've been better without a villain, and just have it be a buddy comedy. Blanchett wasn't AWFUL as Hela but she wasn't that good. It was a passable performance.Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun and a passable way to end the Thor saga. I definitely recommend you watch. I'll rate it 8 'Haircuts' out of 10!",

    "reviewTitle": "Now THAT'S how you make a Thor film!!",
    "reviewBody": "Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were among the weaker installments. They took them a little too seriously and they were a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction though. The humour throughout is pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of the motion picture. The lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friends is a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than being bogged down with Thor's forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from the previous two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the forefront as Hela, the villain of the piece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time of her life portraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki must put aside their differences and try to stop her. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes their dynamic more enjoyable.They end up getting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playing the Grandmaster (but really it's Goldblum playing himself) who forces Thor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gains the trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and from there, it's your classic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director, adding a lot of charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic is also great as well, a real '80s neon feel. And the music...the music was brilliant! Who would've thought that the composer for Rugrats would deliver such an awesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form for the God of Thunder!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "THOR Ragnarok – the best of the 3 standalone's",
    "reviewBody": "This is the third standalone Marvel 'Thor' film, a swashbuckling superhero fantasy that continues directly after where 'The Dark World' ends. The premise is that Asgard is in peril, Thor's objective is to prevent the destruction of his home planet. This film introduces the villain 'Hela', she is the Goddess of Death, she is also Thor's sister, who has been in exile for many years and appears to be a very powerful character, possibly more powerful than Thor! During a particularly colourful action sequence, Thor is transported to a remote 'dump' of a world, on the other side of the Universe, this planet is full of rubbish and discarded people and is ruled by the weirdo 'Grandmaster' outstandingly played by Jeff Goldblum. In order for Thor to get back, he first needs to beat the champion gladiator, who happens to be the 'HULK'. This is also the point where we're introduced to another excellent show stealing character, 'Korg', voiced by the director Taika.The entire film is full of relentless adult comedy sketches and humorous dialogue, which was inspired by the humour and success of Guardians of the Galaxy. With a great soundtrack, this is a hugely entertaining film that balances humor with drama. Highly recommended.",

I didn't want a lousy comedy, I wanted a Thor sequel, and I got a stew made from old Thor recipe plus goofy jokes - apparently they wanted to touch all possible segments of audience - they could include some porn and some vampires and they would have everything. I hope the actors got some fat paychecks, as a consolation for degrading themselves for playing in this one.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Thor Outing Too Date",
    "reviewBody": "One of the biggest challenges with an ongoing series is crafting a story that is on par or better than the prior offering and that the characters continue to grow so audiences do not get a rehash of what they have seen before.With \"Thor Ragnarok\" Chris Hemsworth has returned for his third solo outing, and fifth outing overall as the heroic Asgardian warrior Thor. This time out Thor is on his quest to track down the Infinity Stones and finds himself plagued by visions of Ragnarok: a legend detailing the fiery destruction of his home of Asgard.With an action laden opening, Thor believes he has ended the threat and returns home to find his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), has been sent to Earth and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assuming his place.Thor ventures to Earth with his brother which sets a series of events into motion, the result of which unleashes the long imprisoned Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans the subjugation of Thor and Asgard. Naturally Thor is not going to put up with this, but finds himself mid battle knocked out of his transit home and on a remote world called Sakaar.As if being stranded far from home is not enough of a challenge, Thor is forced to become a gladiator for the erratic Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), whom Loki has managed to charm and become a part of his inner circle.As fate has it, Thor becomes matched with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and must find a way to survive and make his way home before Hella can destroy all that he holds precious.The film is the best of the Thor films and it is engaging from start to finish. There is a significant amount of humor in the film but it does not feel forced and is very appropriate to many of the scenes. The film also has plenty of action and the blend between comedy and action is deftly handed by Director TaiKa Waititi who never lets the film become a parody of itself nor take itself too seriously at times. He knows when there is a time to laugh and when there is a time to be deathly serious.This allows for a deeper and more enjoyable and engaging Thor than has been previously seen. He is not as one-dimensional as he has been in the past as the strong, quick to anger muscle that I would love to see explored in further outings.I had worried from the trailers that the movie might be more of a video game as it seemed heavily dependent on retro style CGI and camp humor which made it seem like something out of the 80s. While there are elements of that, the film mixes the old and new to create one of the most authentic and enjoyable comic adaptations seen to date. It continues the winning formula of Marvel Studios and of course, sets up the next outing for Thor in \"Avengers: Infinity War\" as well as the larger Marvel Universe as we a whole. The film also has some great cameos and I am curious to see how the addition of the newly introduced characters will be explored down the road. The return of Hiddleston was also a real treat as he is so good as the mercurial but always sly and dangerous Loki that he commands your complete attention every time he appears on screen.Marvel has once again set very high standards for comic based movies and has again delivered another winner that you will not want to miss.4.5 stars out of 5.",

The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealisticly good. Hela is one of the best MCU villains so far! Cate Blanchett just killing it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous \"Thor\" movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the \"Revengers\" team, such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome.The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three \"Thor\" movies. Firstly. because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly it's also one of the best MCU movies.Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard Marvel fan, I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela is epic, Odin got his significant role and there are some Huge connections that'll lead to \"Infinity War\" and you'll lose your mind when you see them.MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!",

The darkest story in Thor's history.So of course Marvel Studios makes it a comedy.There is nothing to this movie but jokes. It's quips, pratfall, anus jokes, Hela's kind of lame, Hulk and Thor are a comedy duo. And Thor helps Loki bring Surtur to Asgard so he can destroy it. Let me repeat that in case I wasn't clear. THOR HELPS DESTROY ASGARD AT THE END.It's just so bad.Some of the action was really good, but the forced humor didn't work in this movie.At least Marvel Studios has finally admitted that comedy is their main focus.Getting stellar reviews, of course. Because critics love the MCU and will just pretend they're masterpieces when they're not. This movie was terrible.Critics call it \"FUUUUNNNN\". But it was just lame.I wish I would have saved my money, or burned it. At least if I burned it I still would have wasted money but I wouldn't have sat through this.It sets the final stage for Infinity War, which is going to be a bloated mess.",

    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint! On the contrary, it actually blew me away. Out of the 3 Thor movies, this is without doubt the best one. Some say the humour is futile and aimed at 12 year olds. Well I am mid-30s and I had some really good laughs throughout the movie. It is cool to see the other Marvel superheroes pop up. If you're like me and not reading too much about the films and what characters they'll feature, before going to see them then you'll get a nice surprise. Also some new characters are being introduced. Korg is bound to crack you up. Everyone does a good job in this film though. Loke is still a bit of a scene stealer, but not like in the other films where he rules the roost completely. 130minutes flew by. As always the CGI is astonishing. And the Valkyries flashback scene is beautiful. Fight scenes have you excited! And frankly, any film that opens and closes with Led Zeppelin deserves an extra star! I have no problem giving Thor: Ragnarok 9 out of 10. It is up there with Guardians of the Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised! A great addition to the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Ragnarok (2017)",
    "reviewBody": "After actually being quite a fan of the previous Thor movies, I was incredibly excited to hear that Kiwi, Taika Waititi would be directing this as his previous films, 'Boy', 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' were just amazing and incredible works of fiction. This film did not disappoint though it did lack in certain areas.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor Odinson along with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner although I thought we could've seen more Bruce then Hulk. Tom Hiddleston is living it up as Loki and gives yet another great performance as The God of Mischief.Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban and Idris Elba are all fine members of the supporting cast and I actually really enjoyed Urban's English accent and his character in general. Elba is just badass in every sense of the word. Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel House, Clancy Brown, Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth also gave great supporting performances. Props to Taika for bringing in Rachel House his long time friend into this role and she had some great moments.The cameos of Hemsworth, Neill and Damon were just incredible. The humour is just sidesplitting and has Taika written all over it. The action was actually very good considering the Director's lack of experience and The Valkyrie sequence was just visually stunning. The story was simple and easy to follow, the film flowed really well and it was just really really enjoyable.Cate Blanchett was a bit meh for me, she was good but she just wasn't very memorable. Tessa Thompson was just boring. Uninspiring and uncharismatic and sadly that was the result of the actress not the writer. Some of the effects were a bit naff, they were a bit ragdolly and some shots in Norway were clearly a green screen. But that comes with the inexperience of a big budget with Taika.The biggest con of this film was what happened to the Warriors Three as they were legitimately some of the best parts of the previous Thor films. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and especially Tadanobu Asano deserved much more then to be unceremoniously killed off with barely putting up a fight. Such a shame, a massive shame.Overall this film is fun, exciting and a really enjoyable experience, there are some minor flaws that tarnish the overall film but this is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a great boost to brilliant director Taika Waititi.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's Hammer Time! Is Thor: Ragnarok, worth watching? Yes, it is!",
    "reviewBody": "Unfortunately, it takes one of the most popular Hulk comic book stories ever, 'Planet Hulk', to make 'Thor: Ragnarok', the most entertaining 'Thor' movie yet. Honestly to tell you, the truth. It's a good thing. While, all three 'Thor' movies, have a similar generic premise, in which, an alien force is trying to conquer the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a super-weapon, with this one being Thor's lost-long sister, Hela (Cate Blachett), with Blachett doing a good job, playing sinister, sexy and deadly, even if her character come out of nowhere, unexplained. At least, this movie directed by Taika Waititi & written from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost was a lot more memorable than its counterpart. I can hardly remember, 2011's 'Thor' & 2013's \"Thor: the Dark World' in the years, after both movies came out, at all. This one, honestly stands out. First off, most of the action, takes place, off-world, outside of Earth & the Ninth Realms, giving a lot more, bright & crazy looking, sci-fi vibe, mixed with its fantasy elements. This allow us, to get away from the annoying, human characters such as Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning) & Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), whom in the last movie, pretty much, phone her performance, in. None of them, return. Sadly, this also eliminates, the Warrior Three such as Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Fandral (Zachary Levi), but at least, they had cameos in this film, even if short. Still, it cools to see that Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is still around. However, Alexander's absence in the film, does beg the question. Why, wasn't Sif in Asgard!? Nevertheless, this change in direction, allows new likable supporting characters to emerge, such as Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who does a pretty good job & Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) to shine. While, director, Waititi did an alright motion-capture performance for Krog, a gladiator that Thor befriends. His soft-spoken, Australian accent was a bit jarring for something that came from Norse mythology. The same goes, with Karl Urban as Skruge, whom machine gun mow down scene was really bizarre. Nevertheless, I love how the film is not so bog down with complex, confusing Norse mythology, as the other movies; giving more room for simpler story lines like a prison escape subplot to breathe. While, yes, the whole gladiator fight/revolution plot for the most part, doesn't mesh well, with the main 'Ragnarok' story, in which the movie is title, from. It's still entertaining even with big plot-holes like how the wormholes honestly works, why nobody use the tesseract to get anywhere and how Hulk got to Sakaar, in the first place. Nevertheless, it's cool, that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still the title character, not Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), throughout this, even if it came from a Hulk comic book. The direction for this film, could easily be, misguide with Hulk getting revenge on the Avengers, but they stay focus on Thor trying to get back on his home world. I also enjoy, how the movie took more risk, with the title character. Seeing Thor, have short hair & without his trademark hammer Mjolnir was really shocking. Lucky for the writers & Hemsworth. Most of the risk paid off. Nevertheless, I can still do, without the badly gone, CGI eye injury. It was so fake-looking. It kinda distract me from enjoying the climax. The other special effects were good, but not great. While, none of the CGI in the film, look, deeply realistic. At least, it's beautiful to look at. It match well with the deliberately '80s space opera aesthetic and synth score, composed by new wave band, Devo's bandleader, Mark Mothersbaugh. Additional music featured in the film include \"Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin and \"Pure Imagination\" from the 1971's film 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was also a nice tough. Another highlight from 'Thor: Ragnarok\" is the humor. It was really cheeky & funny, as it really was going for that, 2014's Marvel film, 'Guardian of the Galaxy', sci-fi comedy vibe. Hemsworth really look like, he was enjoying, playing Thor, this time. His performance really made the film, very fun to watch. I glad, he didn't get bored. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, was also nice to see, however, I really getting tired, of the heel/baby-face, working, together, vibe. It was cool in 'Thor: the Dark World'. Here, not so much. I really was, hoping for something new. Still, I did like the cameo of Matt Damon, Sam Neill & Luke Helmsworth, stage-acting out the climax of the last movie, to Thor & Loki. It was a unique touch. It's also cool to see, that Stan Lee is still around, at his age, doing Marvel cameos, as well. I hope that day, where he can't, never comes. Furthermore, along with the Easter eggs, film references, it was also cool to see, characters performers like Benedict Cumberbatch & Scarlett Johansson reprises their roles as Stephen Strange from the film 2016's 'Doctor Strange' & 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. This includes, the mid-credit scenes. Without spoiling it, they really do help set up, 2018's 'Avengers: Infinity War', big time. Can't wait for that movie to come out! Overall: This movie deserves a thunderous applause. While, deeply cartoonish & somewhat childish. 'Thor: Ragnorok\" was a feel good fun romp fantasy escape movie. Highly watchable. Highly recommended.",

    "reviewTitle": "Joyous escapism",
    "reviewBody": "In this Taika Waititi (Boy, What we do in the Shadows) directed film, written by Eric Pearson (Marvel One Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, Marvel One Shot: The Consultant), Craig Kyle (Ultimate Avengers, Hulk Vs.), Christopher Yost (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars: Rebels), based on comics by Stan Lee (Iron Man, Thor), Larry Lieber (Iron Man, Thor) and Jack Kirby (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron) and starring Chris Hemsworth (Rush, Ghostbusters) as Thor.After taking the crown from Surtur (Clancy Brown: The Shawshank Redemption, TVs Daredevil), he returns it to his homeland where Thor finds that his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston: Thor, TVs The Night Manager) has taken over Asgard and hidden Odin (Anthony Hopkins: Silence of the Lambs, Thor) on Earth, but upon his death, Hela (Cate Blanchett: The Lord of the Rings, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) God of Death and their powerful sister, comes to take the throne for herself. Thrown across the Universe, Thor is first captured by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson: Selma, TVs Westworld), sold to Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum: Jurassic Park, Independence Day) and held captive on the planet Sakaar where he and other warriors, including Korg (an inspired turn by director Taiki Waititi), are forced to fight for his entertainment. Ultimately Thor is pitted against The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo: Avengers Assemble, Now You See Me), but without his hammer, can Thor not only win his gladiatorial duel against his former Avenger friend but also convince and assemble a team (Hulk, Valkyrie and his untrustworthy brother) to stop Hela and prevent Ragnarok, the doom of the Asgarian civilisation? This action, adventure, comedy film hit all the right notes for me. The humour was spot on, right up my street (think Deadpool), and this and the action never felt forced. All the actors were on their A game and for me, a huge Loki fan, I have to admit that in his own small way, Korg stole the movie like Loki did in Thor. Not even the turn from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, TVs Sherlock) could beat it.I was pleased that Hela, the main villain, got her character arc as this has been lacking in some previous Marvel films and has for me left the baddies flat, and this time the epic fight scenes bookend the serious moments well. As perturbing as it was for a fan of the mythology for Hela and Fenrir to be used not as Loki's children, it worked for the film and Goldblum's wackiness gelled as well as Samuel L Jackson's bad guy Valentine in Kingsman. Yes it is awful when they summarily kill off some favourite characters, in some cases notably without even giving them a line, and concentrate more on Skurge (Karl Urban: Star Trek, The Bourne Supremacy) but here too they give him a meaningful character arc, he wants to be worthy and he gets his chance. Heimdall (Idris Elba: Prometheus, Pacific Rim) is busy trying to hide and save as many innocent Asgardians as he can while Hela searches for the sword that will help her start the apocalypse for other worlds. And though Banner worries that allowing himself to turn back into the Hulk may leave him that way forever, he too gets his emotional scenes when we see the cameo of Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson: We Bought a Zoo, Lucy) and his chance to shine against the terrifying Fenrir.The soundtrack is epic in its own right, up there with GOTG1, and the film does not feel like more of the same (as some of the superhero movies have sadly started feeling), it feels back to its best. If this is to be the last Thor movie, then they gave him a great one to bow out.Yes the movie had a few flaws (e.g. Thor has never wanted the power of ruling, Banner may stay as the Hulk), but as the best way to describe the film is pure fun, I am going to give it 10/10 despite these because that is just what most people need at the moment, joyous escapism.",

    "reviewBody": "Amazing! This was the best Thor movie and it isn't even close. This one was superior in so many ways. This one had a great plot, a good story, great acting, amazing directing, a different genre, and a better tone. I personally loved the plot of Thor and Loki looking for Odin, then finding him as he is dying. Then, because Odin's powers were the only thing keeping her locked up, Thor and Loki's older sister Hela appeared and shattered Thor's hammer. Thor and Loki then get stranded on Sakar where they find The Hulk who disappeared after Avengers: Age of Ultron. They then teamed up with a former Valkyrie to try and stop Hela from conquering more than just the nine realms. The story was also great, I loved the emotion during Odin's death, and I loved how they were able to tie in Age of Ultron when the Hulk went missing. I feel the writers did a great job. I thought the acting was the best from all the Thor movies, especially the acting for the villain, I loved how Heimdal was portrayed instead of whatever he was in the first two. I also loved Taika Waititi's directing. The directors of the first two Thor movies stuck to a very strict way of portraying everything, you could tell the Taika took lots of risks, and they all paid off. I also like how Marvel is diversifying their genres, it seems they like doing the action comedies, and I have no problem with that because they have all been good. Lastly, I liked the change in tone from the first two movies. They were both darker and serious whereas this movie was more lighthearted and funny. I hope Thor: Love and Thunder is the same way.This was a great movie that provided laughs, but still managed to stay serious when it needed too. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it, I just recommend watching the first two Thor's first.",

    "reviewTitle": "Crazy colorful space warrior adventure on the big screen,",
    "reviewBody": "The movie is great. It's a new experience. It does have deep flaws that affected my experience though, but a good enjoyable fresh movie overall.The movie will be a pretty fresh experience. 80 percent of it its outer worlds adventure extravaganza. The planets and designs are incredible. The story is pretty cool too. But...My problem with it it's not what some people have pointed out: The movie is way more of a comedy than the previous two. It's just that Taika Waititi didn't care about taking the plot seriously at all, like in purpose. You don't need to have a loose plot to be hilarious and a comedy masterpiece, look at the first Hangover, look at how high the stakes were in that movie. This movie jumps from point a to b without any regard on how or why, a clear example of this is the Hulk. I have expected since Age of Ultron for marvel to answer how Hulk left for another planet and the answer is \"He just did\"? This is true for all the plot points in the movie. This is just the sort of thing the Russos would have polished completely while keeping all the jokes.I thought the story was full of missed opportunities (Fan Fic incoming, skip if you hate Fan Fic mindsets) why not have the hammer be a limitation of Thor's true power created by Odin to limit him so what happened to Hela becoming evil and unstoppable never happens to him. Making not only Thor's unlocking of his true potential logical but also symbolical now that he lives in a world where his father, the most powerful man wont be there to protect his world. The Thor Hulk fight was cool as hell, even if it was a little simple, it looked incredible. They gave it a definitive space pay per view filter or something. It looked awesome. Hela was cool as well. AND HERE's my biggest defense for the whole movie: Thor himself was great. It felt Waititi designed the whole process of the movie on getting who Chris Hemsworth is, how (Chris Hemsworth) HE sees Thor not how Kevin Feige or Marvel or we the fans have told him to act. How he could actually connect with a Thor he was frankly disconnected from more and more. And I think in this aspect for what the movie is, they had a freaking home run. Hemsworth is fresh again and better than ever. He is awesome, he is Thor and he enjoys it. It feels more like a psychological acting directorial procedure milestone more than a movie merit. But directors should look at whatever Waititi did, because he might have unlocked Chris Hemsworth potential to be awesome to watch on camera. There you have something I can not stop giving props to. So yeah objectively a 7/10 but I would re watch this a thousand times over the 2 previous ones. Also I can not give enough merit on how this movie readjusted Thor incredibly well without him feeling at all like a new character or forced in any way. Its just great overall.I would like to see him in other movies. He could have a serious role in a war movie or a criminal thriller. Hemsworth rocked, and Loki as much as I hated him in the past due to his popularity is freaking incredible as he has always been.",

Hela is about to conquer the world and kill everybody let's make a little joke. A fight started, oh, please, another little joke. Thor steps on a banana and falls down, ahahaha, funny. Loki - 0 power in all the movie, 0 spells, 0 abilities, just nothing, where was his power, he was so useless and did almost nothing in all the movie. Hulk - personality of a teenage boy on steroids. Thor - so funny, oh my god, joke after joke. Is he THOR or the kid of Deadpool?I had so high expectations but this movie targeted only the kids with all the not funny jokes.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"He's A Friend From Work!\"",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok has been touted as the bezt film in the Thor trilogy, and it's not hard to see why. Taking over from Kenneth Branagh and Alan Taylor, Taika Waititi adds a touch of weird to the God of Thunder's adventures. Add Taika's unique, zany style to a fun story, fun characters, and plenty of action, and we've got a memorable conclusion to Thor's solo series.This movie follows Thor as he is tossed from Asgard all the way to the planet Sakaar and forced to compete in a tournament for his freedom. With the help of his brother Loki, newcomer Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and his fellow Avenger the Hulk, Thor must fight his way back to Asgard and stop his sister Hela (Cate Blanchett) from taking it over and bringing about Ragnarok, the end of all things. All the principle cast members from the previous Thor movies return, and other cast members include Jeff Goldblum, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Karl Urban.Ragnarok marks a pretty big shift in tone from the previous Thor movies, in that it takes itself far less seriously and pretty much plays everything for a laugh. The movie basically pokes fun at itself and pretty much every other MCU movie. In other words, it's a very meta movie. Even the characters don't really take anything seriously; they basically play it like it's nothing they haven't seen before, which is pretty much true.I'm sure that some were disappointed that Natalie Portman's Jane didn't return, and may find the tone shift jarring, but it doesn't bother me too much. Plus, we've got plenty of newer characters to make up for Jane's absence. Tessa Thompson is great as Valkyrie, who's a very goofy warrior with a drinking problem. Beneath the alcoholism, though, lies some deep trauma and a complicated past. Jeff Goldblum plays the Grandmaster, who's basically Jeff Goldblum in a brightly-colored robe. He has many funny moments, and I wouldn't mind seeing him again in the future. And Taika Waititi gets to play a character named Korg, a rock-monster who's very funny and becomes an instant favorite.Hela is a pretty inventive villain. Some retconning is done to fit her into Thor's history, but it works pretty well. Blanchett's performance is excellent, as she gets to villain it up while wearing a pointy crown on her head, which is basically her hair when she slicks it back. She's also able to conjure up weapons from her arms, making her unpredictable against Thor. Karl Urban plays her henchman Skurge, and while he isn't the most threatening bad guy, he also gets moments of hilarity and nuance here.Chris Hemsworth is given a chance to explore Thor's wackier side, and it works to great effect. Thor gets several funny moments in this movie, especially with his partners-in-crime. He has several moments with Loki that are especially a riot. Speaking of Loki, he's a standout as always, and this time it's not to the detriment of the other characters. The Thor/Loki relationship is explored further in Ragnarok, and it leads to Thor accepting that maybe his relationship with his brother will never be the way he imagined.Ragnarok partially adapts the Marvel Comics storyline Planet Hulk, and the Hulk himself is utilized more than he has been in the past. The Hulk is given a bigger role, as we begin to see the conflict between Hulk and Banner really present itself. It doesn't hurt that the Hulk is now able to actually speak, and he gets several great one-liners. The movie also gives Thor and Banner more interaction than in past Avengers movies, and it's fun to watch them team up. Benedict Cumberbatch turns in a brief-but-fun cameo as Doctor Strange; he doesn't play a huge role in the grand scheme of things, but it's still fun to see him one last time before Infinity War.It's not all goofiness in Ragnarok; at the heart of it all is Thor accepting his role as King of Asgard, and his desire to live up to his father Odin's legacy has formed the backbone of his arc in the MCU. And things begin to take a dark turn by the time the credits roll....",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor Wreck-narok!",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel's version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It's not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don't need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn't be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that's entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn't perceive time as we do, he doesn't think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn't have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren't able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn't (couldn't) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that's it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there's no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it's as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it's true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn't get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn't good. In fact, it was kind of a \"prequel\" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I'm exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that \"theater play\". I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I'm sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn't a \"sequel\" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you'll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we'll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time...",

    "reviewBody": "Me'n the missus were looking forward to seeing Thor: Ragnarok. We'd seen the shorts and were impressed. So off we hopped to see it in a manner that holders of the 'Holy Seniors Card' grandly imagine to be 'nimble'. It was made in Australia and has Australians in it and some New Zealanders too who aren't yet famous enough to be claimed as Australians.Odin, Thor's dad has flown the coop and left Asgard to live in Norway and look at the ocean. Thor, and his brother 'Loki the Dodgy', go to visit him via Dr Strange in a bit that I didn't quite understand. Loki, I discovered is/was Taylor Swift's squeeze! Thanks, Doctors waiting room magazines! Next visit I'll try and find out who Taylor Swift is.Odin tells the Thorster that he isn't really the firstborn and he has a big sister and she has been hidden away because she is temperamentally questionable, in the manner of a youth who might feature in the first episode of a 'Kids who Commit Genocide' documentary series is temperamentally questionable. Not only is she super-mean, but she's really REALLY strong and has no need of a hammer; she has attitude! She is called Hela but is really darkside Galadriel who has covered her ears up. Being the firstborn she has dibs on the throne.Thor ends up in a sort of fighting pit run by Wilderpeople and Jurassic Park'ers. I didn't really understand how he got there except there was a drunk chick involved. Doesn't really matter, but. It was pretty funny. Thor meets Korg who is a gladiatorial support act made out discarded drystone and is one of my favouritest characters. They become friends. Thor takes his shirt off and there was a sharp intake of breath from the female audience members, as well as the two blokes sitting behind us. He also gets a haircut.Thor fights the Hulk in the fighting pit. How the Hulk got there isn't explained but it doesn't really matter. It's a good fight too! I want to know who makes the Hulk's trouser because I too have gotten heaps bigger over time and a pair of expanda-pants would be handy.There is a sort of alliance formed and they all head off to Asgard to take care of Darkside Galadriel/Hela. It's not going to be easy. Making up a name for the alliance is tricky too.There is a big battle and 'Immigrant Song' is played. I still think it should be our national anthem. I grandly consider myself a visionary, and as such it is my lot to have my great ideas ignored. I won't ruin it by telling who wins.Is it any good? YessirreeeBob. It's directed by the same person who directed 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and that is a fave. He's a New Zealander at the moment but we'll adopt him soon. It's good enough that I'll prolly buy it on Blu-ray and take it away on golf trips to entertain the drunks.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Movie but for ...",
    "reviewBody": "If I had just gone by the previews, and not been so caught up in the Marvel storyline, I probably would have given this movie a miss. Well, it turned out that it was just Cate Blaunchett's really bad acting (or overacting). It seemed as if she really couldn't play a superhero bad guy, or even sit well in a superhero movie. Sure, she may have won and Oscar or two, but this role was certainly not Oscar worthy (not that any of the Marvel films ever make it into the Oscar fields as it is). In fact her portrayal of Hella was so bad that I literally cringed whenever she opened her mouth.Anyway, the film begins with Thor in a cage. He has been travelling the galaxy looking for the infinity stones, with little to no luck, and is now a prisoner of Surtur, one of the Asgardian bad guys. Anyway, to cut a long story short, and after an awesome rendition of The Immigrant Song by Led Zepplin, he defeats Surtur and finally returns to Asgard to discover that Loki is up to his old tricks again. Unfortunately this latest trick has resulted in Odin's death, and their sister Hella being set free to rampage over Asgard. Meanwhile Thor and Loki are banished to a trash world where they (or at least Thor) needs to escape. Along the way he also discovers that The Hulk has also landed up here.This isn't a new story, if fact it is one that I have seen time and time again. The hero is banished from his home and a malevolent force takes over. The Hero must escape the prison, return to his home, and defeat the bad guy. Sounds simple, well not quite, because this is Ragnarok, which basically signals the end of Asgard. While the story was old hat, and Blaunchett horrible, the execution was near perfect. Interestingly the director was born in New Zealand, and when he appeared in a pre-opening scene, I suddenly discovered that he played a minor role in the film (the South Pacific accent stands out a mile, at least where I'm concerned).Oh, I should also mention the jokes. As one reviewer pointed out these later Marvel Movies seem to be really ramping up on the humour, and in part it is starting to ruin them. Some of them are really good, but others of them are forced and unnecessary. In fact a part of it seems to be turning into something like Galaxy Quest than a serious science-fantasy superhero movie, which is actually a little disturbing. For instance the name of the singularity that they used to escape from the garbage world was quite unnecessary. Still, it is a pretty good movie, but I do feel that they need to start toning down on the humour a little.",

    "reviewBody": "The concept of Ragnarok for a Thor finale was unexpected and amazing especially since the Norse myths on which the event is based on and the comic arc is based on were great sources for this movie and I think Taika read exactly none of them.The whole grandiose Ragnarok was the 5 minutes Surtur trashed Asgard.As for the characters:1)Thor:Had some development,learned to work together with people,trust in his power and the responsibility of a leader,after 3 movies he just learned that.His attitude towards the whole situation was unnecessary to be honest,most of the times he felt like he either didn't care or was unaware of the real danger.I liked that for once he could stand his own against Hela(for a while),defeated Hulk and the monsters in Hell and Hela's army of the dead.I loved his version of Thorforce(his true potential).2)Hulk/Banner:It finally gave the big guy some development,some conciseness,some feelings of his own,it was good to see him caring for his friends and acting like a sentient being for once.It was refreshing to see the man and the beast coming at terms with their mutual need for each other.I don't really understand yet why Banner would disappear forever if he ever should turn into Hulk again,which he did.So is Bruce forever gone? 3)Hela:Blanchett by far was the best part of the movie,her stellar performance and her look were amazingly accurate to the comics,she looked convincing and acted royal and for once I saw an evil character enjoying her colors and proudly wearing them.Personality wise she was Hela mixed with Angela and Gorr and her powers were mostly drawn from Gorr which while cool was disappointing,her action scenes were cut short,her screen time was unfairly small for the one supposed to be THE VILLAIN of the movie and despite all this she was the best developed character in the movie in my mind.The most disappointing thing about her and Valkyrie was that their epic fight was reduced to a few shots and that was all,not event a small 3 minutes scene.Her getting stabbed or kicked by the asgardians felt weird since she is presented as Odin's right hand,not that it damages her but looks pretty careless for the general who helped conquer the 9 realms.Also Fenris was reduced to her pet gal dog,while nice to see her it was a very stupid decision.Even if her scenes were meaningful,she was super underutilized. 4)Odin:His death was rushed and I didn't't really feel the tragedy in it,his joke about the God of Hammers was good tho,I would also like to point out that I liked him giving Thor that extra boost of confidence to let his power loose for once.I also loved seeing his true face,a war hungry powerful being,who along his daughter knelled the 9 realms into submission but after all,had a limit which made him question Hela's sanity and purpose in all that.5)Loki:Arounded character since the Avengers,he is in the movie to add to Thor's relationship,has a few good jokes and some nice moments.6)Valkyrie:Thessa did an amazing job playing a legendary warrior,hunted by the past who succumbed to alcohol and man hunting to bury her pain and loss but it was weird how she was so easily convinced to join the Revengers.I loved her suit and her action sequences. 7)Surtur:2nd best addition to the movie,it was great to see him in the beginning,his design was superb but even in his weakened state I felt he was defeated too easily.Him being reborn and fulfilling his destiny while facing Hela was pretty epic but short lived,the true meaning of the movie was brought to life by this guy and he was at his job for 3 minutes or so.8)Grand Master:The character seemed like a Psychotic ruler of a trashy planet,didn't't feel powerful or truly evil,just mad,if that was the intention than bravo to Golblum but I feel the best parts that came of the characters like his speech at the end,the talk in the arena,etc were his work and not the script.I liked his way of dressing and how quick he would switch between moods and ironically how he hated violence. CGI:Looked very good sometimes like Hela vs Surtur scene,Hela vs the Valkyrior,Thor vs Hulk,everyone vs the army of the dead but the scene they changed,where Hela emerged from her prison was bad in terms of effects,they filmed a new sequence and then added the old,alley one reaction when she caught the hammer. Soundtrack:It was formidable,especially the Immigrant song added to the biggest action pieces throughout the movie. Landscapes:I was beyond happy with what we got,Skar,Asgard,ruins of the old cemetery below the Throne room,the secret fortress,Hell,Hela's prison,Norway,Sanctum Sanctorum and of course New York. Personal observations:1)Hela as a mix of characters I felt ended up doing more bad for her than good,her comic self is so much superior to this mixed bag they did,it ended up being good thanks to Blanchett's acting.I was so disappointing we got no throne in Niffelheim but a cheap prison set up by her father,powered by his life force. 2)The Asgard scenes while more meaningful than Skar were too short,very insightful but short. 3)Taika's directing was wrong for this movie,the comedy was good but it needed more seriousness,more cosmic action,more Ragnarok and less improvisation,because not everyone is Goldblum or Blanchett to rock at these things.4)I sure Hope Hela takes over Death's role in MCU and we will get her back,she deserves this,both her and Cate unless they want to waste another Oscar actress...",

    "reviewTitle": "Exciting light-humored movie",
    "reviewBody": "Here it is, our God of Thunder is back after AoU.As many reviews said that this movie is light-humored movie, I can confirm that's true. However, for me, it didn't reduce much essence of the theme. It's well delivered. Other than this, I do very like the visualization and cinematographic, especially on bifrost fight. It beats GoTG for sure.Okay, the characters. FFS, Hela is OP. Thor didn't have any chance against her. She is unstoppable and cannot f-word die. She is goddess of death, after all. Maybe I can put her in the third position of strongest villain on MCU below big-purple man and Surtur. I didn't list Dormammu because we have not see his true strength.So, conclusion. Nearly cry tears for joy by seeing the original power of Thor, Valkyrie is awesome, Loki is still God of Mischief, Heimdall didn't have Soul Stone neither nor Hela, there is a character who totally change in Infinity War later, and we get a tiny glimpse on how Thor get stranded in Star Lord's ship in first post end credit scene.It's a 8.0 of 10",

    "reviewTitle": "Over-Parody of Itself",
    "reviewBody": "Its gotten to the point where superhero franchises are trying to re- invent themselves with each iteration, and \"Thor:Ragnarok\" is a case in point. Directed by Taika Waititi to the excesses and extremes of goofiness, \"Thor Ragnarok\" doubles down on the sitcomish fluff of its 2nd middle sibling big brother movie \"Thor Dark World\". The movie actually suffers on a binge of humor, certainly an over-parody of its excellent origin installment. Some of the humor works and some of it wears thin, especially the sarcasm. The effects are gorgeous to behold, but there is, like other recent Marevel sequels, an amp-up in humor at a cost in gravitas and weight of story. Its no easy task to find the balance or happy medium for directors and Waititi turns on the proverbial fire-hose to the point where the rest of the story feels perfunctory. One last thing, there is no place for Willy Wonka or Led Zepplin riffs as messy overlaps in tone and poor choices for music. 6/10 mixed",

    "reviewTitle": "My head is Thor",
    "reviewBody": "I went in to this film maybe a little too expectant, I love Marvel, love the Thor comic character, and love the way Chris Hemsworth portrays him on the screen. However, this film is COMPLETELY different to every other portrayal of Thor and it doesn't work. Thor's comedy has generally stemmed from his failure to integrate with humans on earth, when he was on Asgard he was this regal, well versed, humble, albeit slightly cocky character, yet from his first scene you can tell the film is taking a completely different route with him. And this is where the main problem of the film lies. For a film called \"Ragnarok\", which is basically about the death & destruction of Asgard, there is too much of a light tone throughout this film and WAY TOO much \"comic\" dialogue - I put that in speech marks as a lot of the one liners do not work and fall flat, and this is purely because of the sheer volume of them in the film. Comedy only works when there is a straight man to work off, yet nearly every character in the film is written the same and thus loses their individuality. This is such a shame as it causes the film to lose all impact on the sad or serious moments. Within the first 30 minutes Thor discovers the Loki is posing as Odin and, instead of being A: amazed he's still alive, and B: He's somehow banished his all powerful father, he simply laughs this off as a little joke Loki has played, then when they find Odin and he subsequently \"dies\" just before they meet Hela, who then goes on to destroy Mjolnir, there is no mourning period and before you know it we're on Sakaar being treated to no end of electrocution jokes.(Though isn't Thor the god of Thunder and can summon lightning?? Why would he be incapacitated by an electric shock?)It's such a shame that, as Thor has just lost 2 of the most important things to him, this isn't given time to sink in or be dealt with and is just glazed over with a quick childish argument with the Hulk.It's not all bad though, I found once on Sakaar the film picked up somewhat. The Hulk/Thor fight doesn't disappoint, and there were a couple of nice character additions here, the Grandmaster was better than I thought he would be and wasn't too \"Goldblum\", Korg is probably the funniest part of this film and his comic lines do work well, I would like to see him return again. Hulk is fleshed out a bit more as well and we continue to see the internal struggle between him and Banner during the film. Another addition is Skurge who, the less said about him, the better..! Pointless, waste of time being in the film. Valkyrie is a strange character, I know she was completely changed from the comic books, but I don't think that the character is particularly well developed and thus I wasn't really invested in her at all during the movie. I also think the part quite easily could have been portrayed by Lady Sif, (who is strangely absent in the film despite the warriors 3 appearing??) And would have had more impact in the plot than the reasoning behind Valkyrie's self imposed exile. But the main plus point from the film, which is music to Marvel fan's ears, is Hela is a success as a villain, it has been a long time since we've had a villain to rival Loki (who FYI is wasted in the film and is getting a bit annoying now) but Hela is great, we got some development in to her character, albeit a little small, but I very much look forward to her appearing in Infinity War so we can hopefully develop her further.So whilst it's not the best Marvel film, it's certainly not the worst by a long shot. I did enjoy it, it was just the constant barrage of jokes wore very thin very quickly and definitely detracted from the overall story. But with all this said, my non fan boy friend loved the film....!",

    "reviewTitle": "Some glaring weaknesses, but still pointless fun as a whole",
    "reviewBody": "\"Thor: Ragnarok\" is the newest superhero movie from the Marvel universe and it is the third one starring Thor (not counting the Avengers films). It runs for easily over 2 hours and marks the arrival at Hollywood filmmaking for director Taiki Waititi (NZL), who is also a prolific actor himself and voice acts in here too. Apart from Chris Hemsworth, there are several other familiar faces in here like Hopkins, Hiddleston, Ruffalo, Elba and Cumberbatch reprising their roles while new additions like Blanchett, Goldblum, Thompson and Urban add their share too, sometimes for the good, at other times not so much. I'll get to that in detail soon. First of all, it needs to be said that this was certainly a solid watch. It is a film that will entertain you well if you want it to. However, the moment you take an in-depth look at it, you will find flaws, flaws that are frequent and flaws that are crucial. One example would be Tessa Thompson's character and performance which was extremely underwhelming as honestly there was nothing remotely interesting about her in here that justified her being built up as a love interest to Thor. Sure seems like they are really struggling with regard to those. At least Portman gets a mention. Blanchett made a pretty good villain to be honest thanks to costume mostly, but also thanks to the actress being almost too good for the part. Sadly her connection with Urban's character never really gains steam, her character feels like the exact opposite of somebody who would get herself an executioner and so the final twist in this relationship stays really underwhelming. Same can be said about the death of Hopkins' character that had zero emotional impact on me unfortunately.The worst part of the film is probably the one in almost the entire second half of the movie where they are trying to make a reference to the refugee crisis. The intention is okay, even if the film really didn't need it, but the execution is extremely shoddy as these poor people running around in their torn clothes added absolutely nothing for me. The consequence is that an actor I appreciate a lot and think he is very talented, namely Idris Elba, was wasted completely in this film. Such a shame. And then there is the comedy of course. I think it needs a little while to become really funny at times as the jokes in the first hour or so are mostly try-hard sadly, but afterward there are more than just a few inclusions and I would say the writers did a decent job overall in that department. As for the characters, there is Banner's fear of not being able to turn back into his human form if he becomes Hulk again. And I thought that is really the best that could happen as Hulk is so much more interesting and funny than Ruffalo's performance. The talk about him being a bigger fire was pure comedy gold and it was one of these moments when \"ego comedy\" fully delivers, certainly much funnier than when it comes from Iron Man. I also quite liked the rock guy. I think he was the one voiced by Waititi. Almost all characters have some very funny moments, so comedy may actually be the area where the film delivered the best, even if there are moments too when it goes very wrong (\"anus to hell\").But there are other departments too of course that make it an enjoyable watch. This film is really on a high level technically including sound, visual effects, but also sets etc. Definitely worth watching if these are the most important fields for you. And the bad guys make it worth seeing too, like Goldblum's absurd turn and Blanchett's scary turn, even if it is tough to believe she would be on par with Thor in the last fight with how she's been crushing all film long. Another thing I like here is that it is a brave film. A lot of stuff happens in these two hours that can't be taken back, the death of Odin, the destruction of Thor's hammer, the end of Asgard where it once was, the loss of Thor's eye etc. and that's pretty bold as they are not just going back to the situation as it was before the film. Okay completely on a side-note now, but where were the Avengers when Hulk ended up on that planet and was unable to turn into his human version? Aren't they supposed to help him as they are his friends. Oh well, on a more personal note, I still find it difficult to accept Loki as a helper in here which he was for the most part given how many times he has been a primary antagonist in these new Marvel superhero films. I think that is all I want to say for now about this film, it has its weak moments and its great moments, but most of the time the quality is somewhere in-between. I don't think I have to give you a recommendation here as I am sure you have seen enough other Marvel/Thor stuff to make up your mind for yourself. I personally give it a thumbs-up though, even if I would say it is slightly inferior to the very first Thor movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor strikes again",
    "reviewBody": "Thor has never been my favourite avenger. Although I quite enjoyed his first movie, I hated the second one, and didn't quite know what to expect with this one. However, I absolutely loved it! In the opening scene the humour felt a bit awkward but it quickly gets better throughout, and had the whole cinema of people laughing. I've seen several people compare it to Guardians Of The Galaxy which I think is quite accurate.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) was brilliant in this movie. He suited the humour really well and played it up quite a bit. It also wouldn't be a Thor film if we didn't have a shirtless scene at some point, and who's complaining to be honest. In my opinion the character was a lot better without the annoying love interest of Jane, who for me personally brought absolutely nothing to the first two movies. She is conveniently tied off when some random human mentions that she dumped Thor, and that's all we hear about her at all. I think the Valkyrie is supposed to be the new love interest, and she shared one or two little moments with Thor throughout the film which was nice. She's a drunk, feisty Asgardian and at least she has more personality than Jane. Just saying, sorry to any Jane fans out there. The dynamic between Thor and Hulk was pretty fun too and he was a welcome addition to the film.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is amazing as always. I'm a bit of a Loki fangirl to be honest so I'm slightly biased, but he was funny as ever. We still don't really know what he's doing, as at some points he tries to save Thor and the next he betrays him again, which is kind of annoying. The thing that still hasn't been explained from the first movie though is if he is a frost giant why does he have godly powers? I don't understand! Anyway at the end there are some brotherly bonding moments, and all seems pretty good between them. For now.The absolute best new character was Korg. A lot of the best jokes came from him and I hope we see more of this character at some point. Hela was also quite a good villain, she had a straightforward aim and plan, which makes a change from Loki's confusing plots. Kinda feel a little sorry for her but not really.Let's talk a little about the plot. Thor wants to prevent Ragnarok, which you probably know as basically the doomsday of Norse mythology. Whilst on Midgard discussing it with Odin, Odin passes away, meaning Thor's evil sister is released from wherever Odin's magic was containing her. The thing that seemed a little strange to me as that nobody knew who Hela was? She was around when Odin was conquering the nine realms, so do no Asgardians remember that? I'm also not sure about the whole evil sister thing, we kind of already had that with Loki but oh well. Also if Hela is literally the goddess of death why can't she just kill everyone with a click of her fingers if she's so 'super powerful' and everything, like how Thor can summon lightening. Oh well.As usual with Marvel films, great songs, cinematography and special effects. Fight scenes were good, plenty of badass moments.Honestly this is the best Thor film, go watch it. It's a good laugh and great action and you won't be disappointed.",

    "reviewTitle": "This is why I love Taika Waititi",
    "reviewBody": "I never even heard about Taika before this movie happened, but as soon as I finished watching it, he literally became one of my favorite directors of all time. This movie is your go to if you need a feel good movie that makes you laugh. I literally can't choose which one is the best and most funny scene, but all of it it's amazing, Stepehn Strange cameo, Loki as a whole, Thor and Bruce, I loved it all, I specially loved how even though it's mostly comedy it tackles serious issues like PTSD, depression, alcholism or the whole arc of Bruce, which I enjoyed so much considering how little anyone on AoU was written to care about Bruce's wishes. It was genuinly so amazing and so funny considering, if you actually think about it, has a really dark and sad plot considering Asgard got stinguished forever, but as Thor said \"Asgard it's its people\" so I'm hopeful. I'd like to mention THOR not needing the hammer and fighting the bad guys alone with lighting and stuff while LE ZEPPELIN's INMIGRANT SONG plays was one of the most iconic scenes on the whole MCU in my opinion.Not gonna lie, I hate we didn't get a canon scene of Valkyrie being bisexual, as it is stablished she is (Tessa and Taika confirmed it), but I'm happy we'll get it on the next movie. Overall amazing casting, amazing writting and directing, amazing comedy, all of it was amazing.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"This joke I like it! ANOTHER!\"",
    "reviewBody": "Those of us with the unmitigated gall to still love Marvel Studios movies bear a perennial cross: everyone else bemoaning their superhero ennui. How they've had enough of self-important, solemn, formulaic superhero films, with their aimless CGI- drenched climaxes, paint-by-numbers villains, and clumsy scaffolding to sell tickets to future movies. \"All fair,\" I respond, as we wait to pre-order our Black Panther tickets. Still, you know what they say about squeaky wheels - Disney execs listen to them, apparently. And lo, there was balance in the Force er Thor-ce? And Ragnarok is its puzzling Skywalker. On one hand, its unfettered comedic whimsy and synth-soaked Flash Gordon pastiche feel like a profound victory for the forces of fun. And yet, there's something perennially off - an indulgence in its kookiness that goes beyond cheeky and strays perilously close to contemptuous at times. Granted, it's perversely appropriate that a blockbuster titled after the apocalyptic eradication of Asgard and the Gods work to dismantle the established tone and mythos of Thor so gleefully. Still, as giddily enjoyable as this apocalypse is, there's still an inescapable sense of the baby being thrown out with the Asgardian bathwater. Thor - a literal 'super-god' - has always been tough to sell. Even Kenneth Branagh, hired for his Shakespearian credentials, subjected ol' Goldilocks to slapstick and punchlines galore (and a meowing Kat Dennings) in his first cinematic outing to keep him accessible. In this regard, the quirky, charming Taika Waititi is an unorthodox but inspired directorial choice, and he musters up more colour, zippiness, and breezy humour that Thor's previous four appearances combined. No gag, be it witty or scatological, is too small for Waititi, and it's rare for his leads to go more than a few minutes without being subjected to some kind of amusing physical comedy indignation (Hiddleston's Loki, of all people, steals the film's biggest laugh and pratfall in one fell swoop). And, varying degrees of silliness or not, the film is uproariously funny from opening to closing shot. What doesn't work as well is the film's comparative lack of consequence otherwise. Well-deserved zany tonal shift or not, Ragnarok is, literally, about the end of the world. And, although proceedings need not be as dark as, er, The Dark World, it is fairly disconcerting-nigh-disrespectful to have a film involving genocide, slavery, the inglorious death of the entirety of Thor's family(!!!), subplots unpacking Asgardian war-crimes and refugees (intriguing but under-explored), and, y'know, the whole end of days thing, be treated with such glib indifference by Waititi's customary impassive deadpan. Characters factually state that they are upset about their tribulations, but it seldom resonates, as Waititi, uncharacteristically, deprives them of the gently emotional character check-ins that elevate his more strictly comedic fare - Viago the vampire pining like a puppy at the window of his aging crush; Ricky Baker's crude, pyromaniac haiku betraying a lifetime of loneliness. Similarly, the film's editing is almost teasingly clumsy, careening between locations and disparate plot points (including a Benedict Cumberbatch cameo as riotously enjoyable as it is transparently superfluous) with a smirking nonchalance. If Waititi's intent was to have his cake and eat it too - taking the p*ss out of Thor while still delivering a straightforward Thor romp - he heartily delivers on the former, but too often at the behest of the latter. Still, as the Grandmaster might chortle, you can debate academic semantics all day, but we all know why we're really here. And, in terms of exhilarating spectacle, Waititi kicks it out of the gladiatorial arena. From fire demons and subterranean dragons, to the impressively nuanced emotions of a certain jolly green giant, Ragnarok boasts some of the most exceptionally realized visual effects in a Marvel film, and Waititi draws a clever contrast between the pristine, techno- mythology panoramas of Asgard (which we finally see, beyond throne room and rainbow bridge!), and the junky, Jack Kirby cubism of Sakaar. Similarly, the film's combat, both in and out of the arena, is fast, furious, and engrossing, with operatically surreal touches - including a showdown between Hela's rippling waves of knives, spaceship lasers, a giant wolf, and two machine guns - keeping proceedings fun and fresh.Chris Hemsworth has proved himself more than reliably adept at flexing comedic muscles in tandem with biceps. Nonetheless, this Thor is a few too many \"Bros\" and mugging punchlines away from his past self to fully invest in to the extent we know we can and should. Tom Hiddleston, conversely, continues to find new, compelling wrinkles in Loki - both comedic, as a begrudging whipping boy, and in quiet, crestfallen, recognition of his perennial self-sabotaging his secret aspirations of heroism. Mark Ruffalo is pristinely deadpan without overstaying his welcome, while playing his warring Hulk/Banner character beats of indignant, cavernous loneliness for all their worth. Cate Blanchett preens with masterful predatory menace, but feels almost criminally wasted as yet another frustratingly underdeveloped Marvel foe. Thankfully, Tessa Thompson is coolness personified as the grimly alcoholic Valkyrie, even if Karl Urban's Skurge feels a touch too goofy and hangdog, given his ferocious comic referent. That said, if Ragnarok unleashes one abiding gift unto the world, it's the most unapologetically unhinged Jeff Goldblum since he first growled like a dinosaur back in '93. Every microsecond of Grandmaster weirdness is a rainbow rose of enigmatic wisdom. Thor: Ragnarok stands as a curious, slight overcompensation from a company fighting to appease a virtually built-in audience. Still, as a comedy first, superhero film second, it's an uproariously entertaining ride, albeit one that may leave comic purists wishing Waititi could have dialled down the silly or dialled up the emotion 20% for optimum Odinson. Still, as ThorFour may never grace cinemas, it's sufficient to crank the Led Zeppelin, and ride into the intergalactic sunset with him getting to enjoy himself for once. Excessively nitpicking a swan song so well-deserved would be \"just ugh the worst.\" -7.5/10",

    "reviewBody": "This review contains spoilers.Thor: Ragnarok is the third movie in the Thor movie series. The movie stars Thor the god of Thunder as he seeks to stop Ragnarok. Hel, played by Cate Blanchett, rises and seeks to dominate Asgard.Thor: Ragnarok is first and foremost a fun adventure. All the scenes in this movie have bright and vibrant colors. The dialogue in this movie is also meant to be light-hearted and funny. Thor has become a more funny character in his dead-pan delivery than in his previous movies. Anyone that has seen Guardians of the Galaxy will be familiar with the color palette and tone of this movie. The humor is similar. This tone also shifts Thor's character. If audience's liked Thor's stoicism, it is not as prevalent here. It seemed as if the writers wanted to course correct Thor to be more likable.The story is similar to a mini-Avengers movie. Thor assembles his team to stop Hel. This leads him to a multi-world adventure where he recruits Loki, Hulk, and Valkyrie. In addition he also leads a prison revolt. The story is nothing new to the Marvel cinematic universe. Aspects of this story has already been present in other movies. The differences here are its setting and characters. The beloved Thor characters are here and audience swill like seeing them. The characters and events did become predictable. The audience only need to imagine the silliest result and it will happen. This is the story's weak point as it felt as if the characters all shared the same traits. It felt as if the movie was written quickly as scenes seem to end with no consequence.Cate Blanchett and Chris Hemsworth are the main highlights here. Cate does a good job as Hela and scenes with her are enjoyable. Hela is still a normal Marvel villain but her dialogue is more enjoyable. Chris Hemsworth dealt with his character's changes well and he is a more funny character here. Tom Hiddleston is a classic as Loki. The greatest surprise is Jeff Goldblum as the grand-master. His line delivery is perfect as he portrays an oppressive but fun master of a world.Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is recommended. It is a movie that is a fun adventure, however it does not do anything different from the Marvel formula.Grade: B.",

I know that you have to sell a product that doesn't mean you make an action movie or a hero movie Or a superhero movie do a total slapstick comedy full of puns and one-liners making me think I'm watching a 90s superhero movie with 2017 digital effects if you wanted to characterize this as a comedy and then probably I would have given in the higher score but since it was in my word superhero movies it deserves the lowest score that can be given the director was great but if this was meant to be a comedy nothing new or groundbreaking does not even compare to anything good only reason it is getting good reviews is because the rest of the movies in the box office are below par or not superhero movies. Expected a lot but was severely disappointed. Slot of missed opportunities.",

    "reviewBody": "We've clearly hit an era in Hollywood where critics are totally at odds with the general public -and with good taste- with regards to latest blockbusters.From the opening scene, I could tell the comedic tone and the addition of swear-words was a result of Deadpool's success, but unlike Deadpool, the \"humour\" on display here felt more like an insult directed at the viewer. The horrendous art-style, lifted straight out of 1980's Flash Gordon, was also a slap in the face to the viewer. It's like the director was quite openly laughing at how bad he could make this look and still get away with it because it was super-camp.Then we had the usual feminist incursions, with the lead female villain literally crushing Thor's hammer in her hand (only a hand-full of characters can actually lift the hammer, never mind pulverising it!). And we have a female side-character apparently so strong and cool that Thor is humiliated and made to look puny on a regular basis by her. She's also infinitely stronger than the Hulk who at one point gets knocked to the floor by her... then symbolically stepped on then walked over!I could go on, but this movie already robbed me of 2hrs, so I'll simply finish by saying this is right up there with the very worst movies I've ever seen. This is what happens when communism creeps into entertainment.",

Making a comedy movie formula has worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool already, that doesn't mean that it has to be imposed in Thor too.Not bad if you have cheap tickets, but don't pay extra for IMAX/3D experience (we watched in 3D).**SPOILER ALERT AHEAD**Hulk's (and of course Dr. Strange's) character is somewhat forced into the film. Even his CGI looks cheap too.Odin, why bother casting him in the first place? The all-father, one of the most powerful characters of Thor franchise looks tired and bored to continue with the series.Valkyrie, is she supposed to be a musclebound warrior or some glamorous cat-walking (cheap) cosplaying model?Karl Urban, \"Executioner\" again. Great choice but poorly portrayed. You once played Judge Dredd Karl, remember that?If it was supposed to be an (officially) funny movie, Korg was the best!!!",

    "reviewBody": "Recently having seen the great animated Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (2010 Video-also reviewed) I felt it was time to open the pages on a \"New\" MCU title I had missed seeing, which led to me opening the plastic sleeve and getting out the third volume of Thor.View on the film:Smashing down the dour colours of Thor: The Dark World (2013-also reviewed) co-star/ director Taika Waititi & Goosebumps (2015-also reviewed) cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe charge up an explosive cosmic atmosphere of sparkling neon primary colours dripping across the screen, with superb CGI linking the expressive face of the Hulk to Bruce Banner,and sprawling wide-shots by Waititi hovering over the destruction of Asgard.Throwing Hulk and Thor into the Contest of Champions, Waititi hits them both with stylised rapid-fire whip-pans that follow each punch in the exciting Action set-pieces landing with a thump,which Waititi pulls back for close-ups on one-line quips,before a brutal one-punch knock out is delivered.On their own without any of the other Avengers in the Contest of Champions, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo make a brilliant double act as Thor and Hulk, with Hemsworth balancing the seriousness Thor views the dire state of Asgard, with a dead-pan comedic edge from how important Thor treats everything he says.Spending over half the film in CGI, Ruffalo gets under the roar of Hulk to reveal the fear, anxiety and mistrust Banner has for Thor,and of his own ability to control his inner monster,whilst Cate Blanchett delivers her cackling dialogue as Hela with relish, and Jeff Goldblum lights up the flick,as the lounge lizard Grandmaster.Whilst clearly inspired in the gladiator contest by Greg Pak and Carlo Pagulayan's terrific Planet Hulk,the screenplay by Christopher L. Yost, Craig Kyle and Eric Pearson display a thoughtfulness in the heroism of Thor,by using his belief in Asgard, to study the colonialism used by Asgard to grab it's riches and powers.Chipping away at the history Thor's dad Odin has tried to paint his blood-drench brutality over with, the writers wonderfully having Hela, (whose images have been whitewashed/painted over in the palace) display that her desire for destruction has not faded since she was locked away,leading Thor to take to heart protecting his fellow citizens of Asgard,not the wealth Asgard was built on from colonialism, and leaving the land behind as a refugee with his fellow Asgardians for a new home.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel or The Marx Brothers?",
    "reviewBody": "The latest THOR is spontaneous and freewheeling, especially while on a planet straight out of the famous Roman Gladiator arena where, as the trailers spoiled long ago, the anticipated fight between two seemingly indestructible AVENGERS, Thor and Hulk, takes place. Which leads to one of the film's best devices...Thor, without his hammer, is nearly as vulnerable as a mortal human albeit a very strong one up against an assortment of odds, making for a non-stop planet-to-planet roller-coaster ride...Visually a hybrid of the intentionally campy 1980's FLASH GORDON and the first GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY while shadowing plot-elements of STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS and with more sleek, colorful rainbows than we've yet seen on Asgard — which has been taken over by a deadly, invincible sister (looking like Maleficent dressed as a reindeer) that Thor and the mischievous Loki never knew they had — there's a cool retro-techno score to back up the pulsating arcade of explosive action.And while it's understandable that, with such a fantastical superhero, levity is needed to ground the audience, there's a fine line between Fun and Funny, and RAGNAROK, featuring sarcasm-guru Jeff Goldblum embarrassingly overdosing on his own style — breaks it once too often: Superheroes all have powers and/or skills that can, whether built-in or created, turn on and off. But the constantly witty, wry one-liner styling of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark (inventor of 'Starkcasm') has infected Chris Hemsworth's THOR to the point that his third solo film, while enjoyable enough, nearly drowns itself in self-deprecating parody.

    "reviewTitle": "Hiddleston/Hemsworth fun-pack",
    "reviewBody": "What \"Thor: Ragnarok\" explicitly states is a doomsday catastrophe going on; what it really does is reinvigorate a dying cinematic hero with the power of comedy. Who would've known that the Thor universe could have so much comedic effect in the right hands, and that it would be the right direction for such a traditionally serious character. So that is the good aspect of this new Thor, which also happens to be the best of the three; the bad is that, unfortunately, even the creative Taika Waititi can't upset the tired Marvel formula of filling too many scenes with mindless action. It's not like action scenes are bad per se, as they are perfectly rendered in other recent MCU films like \"Homecoming\" or \"Civil War\": they just don't fit in this story as they would elsewhere because they ruin the flow of the story. The story itself is nothing special: just a series of bad guys to give Thor someone to punch or characters from other Marvel brands to team up with. Some of said team-ups are really cool and/or unexpected, and yes, my man Stan Lee has a funny cameo in this one as well. As most people know, the main side-kick of Thor's in this one is the Incredible Hulk. Although they may not be the most sympathetic of characters in the Marvel Universe, it's undeniable that Waititi does a good job of making them fun, at least until they are bound to save Asgard in the customary final big fight. The main villain is a new entry in the MCU: Thor's sister Hela, the goddess of Death, played by a slick Cate Blanchett with a less slick headgear. Her character starts strong, but as the film goes on her personality gets flattened and it's ultimately relieving to see her go to Hel. It is very clear that Disney knows how well received her Star Wars characters have been and it's trying to reformulate them in this Norse context. One can clearly see Han Solo's disinterest, confidence and ultimately reformation in the amazing Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, or Jabba the Hut's careless cruelty in Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster; both actors did incredible jobs on this one, by the way. If it seems that this whole mess may be any fun, yes it is indeed, and its icing on the cake is the fantastic Korg, voiced by Waititi himself, and, even with his limited screen time, one of the best additions to the show. But again, it's the action pieces that really show how handcuffed the author is here, not being able to completely liberate his comedic genius by force of contractual restraints. I would've liked a completely different Marvel movie, but I know it's kind of a non-possibility. Nevertheless, he's able to save the movie with his outstanding witty dialogues, from which the first beneficiary is Chris Hemsworth, proving himself a better comic than he is a dramatic actor. His timing and delivery are simply perfect and it shows from the get go, when our hero is chained from the wall of Surtur's cave. Those chains he frees himself from are the token of him getting rid of his upright persona and finally able to behave the way he does best: having fun. And it only gets better as the next scene is one of the most hilarious in the whole movie: Thor realizing that Odin is actually his brother Loki while watching a Shakespeare-like play of his heroic death in battle. Loki himself, as expected, plays a core part in the film, and he has as effective comedic pieces as everyone else. \"Thor Ragnarok\" really works under many aspects: for a change we get a memorable soundtrack, also graced by \"Immigrant Song\", that really works in the context it's put in. It's a shame that the MCU format demands mindless, useless action at all costs, because outside that downgrade, this could've been the comedy of the year. 7.5/10",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel's most audacious film to date.... and it pays off",
    "reviewBody": "Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-\"that's what heroes do\". The \"Revengers\" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), \"his friend from work\", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.",

    "reviewBody": "My analysis of Thor Ragnarok. (spoilers)The recent installation of Thor was a bit more lighthearted than the previous films, which had more of a serious tone to them. Normally I would complain but I got a few laughs and there was enough substance to the plot, especially the part about Norse mythology.In the film, Odin tells Thor that the time of the Gods are over. And that their reign was largely based on a sham, and that their religion was made up, in order to cover up darker truths about their history....which includes the covering up of Ragnarok, who is just a renamed devil in this movie, complete with horns and fiery breath.Without giving too much away, the coming of Ragnarok is a Norse prophecy of apocalypse. Ragnarok's return led to the freeing of Hela, Thor's sister and daughter of Odin, breaks free from her prison with an army of undead. Yes, there's zombies in a Thor film now! But I'm not complaining. This awakening force of nature will eventually lead to the destruction of Asguard.When Thor realizes that he, and the Hulk and a few other of his friends are powerless to stop Ragnarok from happening, he comes to realize that it was never meant to be stopped...and you can't stop prophecies. The plot isn't the most intricate or dramatic, but the strength of this film comes from the interchange between the cast, who are beaming with charisma. Even the Hulk is charming in this film...yes, that's right, a charming, funny Hulk. Last but not least; the soundtrack was brilliant. It reminded me of Tron Legacy, in that this film felt like a Synthwave musical.",

    "reviewBody": "Not sure what to say or think about this movie. It is hilariously fun, and the jokes are well woven into the narrative, the acting great, the action amazing. In almost every aspect this is the perfect action-y superhero movie, but I still do not like it... Out of all the Thor movies, this is probably my least favorite, and that is saying something. The reason? Well, the blackwashing for one. Again we see Hollywood destroy a great character only because they want to get rid of white people. It is racism, and that racist idea of exchanging white characters with black ones leave a bad taste in my mouth. Secondly there are way, way too many jokes in here. And worse: they joke when people are dying. Oh, a planet is destroyed and millions are dying? Well, let us joke about it. And laugh, and laugh... This is probably the blackest, darkest, most world changing movie (or topic of a movie) Marvel has done, but it ends up being slapstick comedy within a buddy road-trip. This movie feels like they've almost made a spoof move about something serious, and I do not like it at all. This movie should have been dark, gritty, serious, and the focus should have been on the blood, the dying, the ending of a world, but instead we get characters making jokes. This is not the movie I wanted and it is not a movie about Ragnarok. This is a comedy movie about friends going on an adventure. No... I do not like it... Also there are tons of topics just glanced over. Warriors three dying? Well, lets skip over that quickly shall we. Sif not in the movie? Nah, who cares. Loki was Odin the last time around, well let us joke about that and move on. I still give this movie a 5. It is very entertaining, it is funny, and the action is mostly fantastic. I can however not get over the fact that this movie should have been something completely different and in combination with bad taste jokes, and the racism, I cannot give it a higher score. Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far and I hope that this movie does not spill over into other future Marvel movies, because this is how you kill a franchise...",

They did do some marvel movies that were good like the first two Thor's, but this one shows what all of us who see Disney for the ruiners they are!!! This was a fast cash grab for the avengers movie & NOT a stand alone movie!! It's a crossover like the last two Caption America's, last two Iron Man's, the new spider man movies!!!\nThis has some laughs when it's not supposed to be a comedy but fails as a super hero movie in every way!!! Thor is the god of thunder but for most of the movie, they make him look week!! A small disc gets planted on his neck & is used to control him!! A god is not controlable people!!! His hammer gets destroyed by his sister, (the hammer is indestructible)!!! He gets dropped basically, on a junk planet with Jeff G. as ruler!! Hulk has been there for two years & never changes back until he sees an archive clip of Black Widow!!! It's a pathetic attempt at a comic movie!!! These types of movies must be stopped before they get ruined for good!!",

    "reviewTitle": "It's one heck of an adventure!",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok is the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that puts Thor in the spotlight for the third time. This movie is about the rerise of Hela, Thor and Loki's lost sister who rises after being imprisoned for years by their father Odin as she looks to destroy Asgard. While being sent to an unknown world by her, the brothers discover the whereabouts of the Hulk.When I first saw the trailer for this movie I wanted to be realistic with what the final product could have been. I originally thought this movie was going to be just average like the two previous Thor films. Going in, I was wrong. This movie essentially answers many different questions in the span of two hours. Such questions include how Thor would be able to fight if he didn't have his hammer and the aforementioned whereabouts of the Hulk. Speaking of which, the Hulk feels like he has a more of a personality compared to how he usually is. In the other Marvel films that I've seen him, he only really stuck out as a one note character who did nothing but get angry. In this film, he feels like more of a character and this is shown with the heart-to-heart conversation between him and Thor. The movie was also very well shot in terms of the cinematography and the fight scenes. The jokes, while there may be a few too many, really worked and I laughed at virtually all of them. Again, I did feel like the humor overstayed its welcome and was overwhelming at times, which is a little distracting, which brings the movie slightly down for me. Either way, I enjoyed the experience of watching Ragnarok a lot and I am really looking forward to Infinity War coming within the next five months.9/10",

Where are the serious and more somber moments in this superhero film where they have to do dangerous life- threatening things to rescue the world? All serious scenes were plastered with silly things they said.Spoiler part here: The only serious scenes were the ones where Thor talked to his real dad.The Hulk was talking too much and said really silly things and that 'stone-man' fighter with the high-pitched voice was ridiculous.I was looking forward to this movie and the trailer made it look really powerful and serious, but it was a film about clowns with capes.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's Ragnarok, not a day out at Disney World, Marvel.",
    "reviewBody": "If you like your comicbook superhero films full of one-liners, nonsensical plotting, drastic character changes, underdeveloped villains, missing important characters (for no other reason other than they were probably unavailable) then Thor 3 is right up your street. For me, its another wasted opportunity. For the record, I loved Thor 1, disliked Thor 2 and Thor 3 is perhaps a slightly better film than the second one, but I'm rating it lower because it had the opportunity to be so much more than what it was. Ragnarok should not be a comedy buddy film. The consistent comedy played throughout this film (which is literally from the first scene until the last) just feels so out of place in a film that has what should be an epic and profound story. In the context of the film, it removes any semblance of doom, or indeed care to the main characters - if they are able to laugh and joke about the situation, why the hell should you as a viewer care? This comedic attitude spoils what could have been an epic story line. Right from Thor uncovering Loki's deception (and his reaction to that most heinous crime which is somewhat unbelievable) to Kiwi Gladiators constantly cracking jokes in the arena which should be a life or death situation (and in turn, reducing the middle act to a ponderous, overtly long section that is only there to bring Hulk and Thor together), to the most ridiculous character motivational change in the history of Marvel films (looking at you Valkyrie), Thor 3 is a completely wasted story that fails to live up to the hype on almost every conceivable level. I say \"almost\" as the Hulk once again proves a success, adding a layer of development we seem to get to his character in every Marvel film he is in. Other new and returning characters do not fair so well. I'm trying to understand why Tessa Thompson was raved about so much. Forgiving that the character has been completely redesigned from the comicbooks, she is so underdeveloped I have little comprehension why she hates Asgard in the first place, and then returns so quickly by Thor's side. Perhaps the tequila wore off. There's nothing wrong with her performance, there just isn't anything three-dimensional to her character. Loki. God Loki. He's just Loki. Again. It doesn't matter what this guy does, he's just constantly forgiven - for absolutely no reason when his crimes are looked at in the cold light of day. For God's sake Thor, Hela was attempting to do nothing that Loki had already done. It makes no sense. As for Scurge...was he actually even in it? Why was he in it? What purpose did he have?Hela - well, as a design and character, she looked the part, had an awesome power set and an interesting take on things. She probably had some really great reasons for doing what she was doing, when she was doing them. We just, like every other Marvel villain, never get to fully flesh them out. I can't help but think there was a great character there, played by the right person, but its never truly allowed to flourish and gather weight. The \"re-writing\" of the Universe is also a little hard to take with her introduction. Nobody seems to question it. Everybody just accepts it. Not for me I'm afraid. Here's hoping that Avengers 3 can bring this MCU ship back, cause at the moment, the last two films have veered massively off course.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not Bad. But This 8.2 Rating Needs To Go Down A Lot!",
    "reviewBody": "The superhero picture has really overstayed their welcome. I don't mean just Marvel, but DC and others. There's too many clichés, everything is too superficial and everything blends too well with others of similar nature. Now, superhero films are being targeted towards younger children with overly-stylized and colourful sets, and some of the worst jokes possible. Superhero movies now a lacking seriousness and passion that used to make them great. These ones now are far too silly to be taken seriously.While comedy is violently stuffed in these films, the main thing that kept the latest Thor movie from being more than just \"okay\" is that the story made no sense and all the characters were out of place. Dr. Strange appears in it just because. There's some cool monsters in it just because. Cate Blanchett parades around the majority of the movie just because. I know people dig just seeing random cameos and cool things for no apparent reason other than to look cool.Thor and Loki's sibling rivalry is still rocky. Thor either awakens or happens to come across Ragnarok. Cate Blanchett the human version of Rag? Already forgotten and don't care the least. Thor gets transported to a universe (maybe just a planet, but no biggie) where fights happen like UFC. His opponent is the Hulk. We've all seen the excerpt from the trailers. Well Thor's escapades in that universe are weak with uninteresting characters leading the way. And you guessed it: bad jokes! Meanwhile on Earth (or whatever planet the main story is) has Cate Blanchett taking over. She looks cool, but is rather bland. And still: bad jokes!I know that this movie tries to be part comedy, but please don't. The jokes in all the movies (except for Iron Man) are horrible movies that only 6-year-olds will be amused with. Next Marvel movie, please don't force so many jokes!! NONE OF THEM ARE FUNNY!!!!So the jokes suck, the characters suck and are out of place, the stories make no sense, but the action and special effects though...wow! The opening scene has Thor fighting Ragnarok which blew me away. The fight between Hulk and Thor is awesome. There's a few other scenes of breathtaking visuals and sweet action that I loved!This movie is a standard pass.2.5/4",

    "reviewTitle": "Couldn't suspend my disbelief",
    "reviewBody": "Did I just witness an MCU Theatrical Release? It felt like a straight-to-DVD, non-canonical experiment. The things in the film that did make sense, only served to undermine or undo all that has been accomplished in these characters' trajectories over the past few years. And I tried to think of exceptions to that statement, but that only increased my frustration.For example, the character of Loki will always be a favorite, and the tension between his villainy and the love his brother has for him always works well for me (including in this film), but the setup we got in the last film (with Loki deceiving everyone into thinking he's Odin) was scrapped and simply laughed off. Same thing with Thor's intense connection with Jane, which we've been developing over time: laughed off. And Thor's vow to Doctor Strange? Also laughed off. Didn't we witness Thor learn honor and integrity over the years? And yet he vows to take Loki and his father and return straight to Asgard, which he eventually does do, but in the end he has the choice of taking everyone anywhere in the nine realms, and where does he choose? The exact planet he'd promised to vacate. At least with Skurge the question of loyalty showed some inner vexation, but even that felt out of character.So much made no sense. Why does constantly raining trash on Sakaar make such teeny tiny piles? And why is the entire population of Asgard so tiny too? Why do the sets feel so fake? Why are none of the jokes funny? Why does Thor refer to his experiences with the Avengers as \"work\" (as if his God-of-Thunder duties are something he goes home from)? I hated that line in the preview. Why does Thor express no sorrow when his close band of warrior friends is killed? What are Hela's powers, and why do she and her costume instantly recover from stabbings? Why does Hela's admittedly bad-ass crown change back and forth between two distinct styles (sometimes covering her cheekbones, and sometimes not)? And if Thor has a mystical power (namely, the ability to mask his hammer as an umbrella), why combine that with a scene where Thor is being subjected to Doctor Strange's tricks, making it seem like the umbrella deception is Doctor Strange's doing? It's needlessly confusing. And what's the reason the Hulk is stuck as the Hulk, not returning to Banner form (nor increasing in size when attacked during combat) for two years? And why did the first teaser trailer ruin so many important plot points? (I'm SO glad I didn't watch the later previews, which ruin even more of the story.) Oh, and if you're going to give a rock creature a voice, why choose a vocal style so dependent on nuanced lip control, rather than a back-of-the-throat voice? All these things take the audience out of the movie.This film had so much potential, so many opportunities wasted. Take Hela's healing for example: the camera never focuses on how she's impervious to stabbings, and this could have been a profound cause of fear and suspense for the characters, rather than a cause of audience disbelief. We also got a build-up of suspense when the Hulk attacks the flaming giant Surtur, but then he quickly and awkwardly retreats, anti-climactically. Also bizarre: when Odin dies, we aren't given the chance to linger in the moment, and Thor certainly doesn't seem shaken up about it. Even the torturous murder of the Grandmaster's cousin is laughed off. And the actors were allowed to ad-lib too much; there was immense potential for some really good lines, but these opportunities were wasted too. Just lazy.Oh, and the '80s-style synth music felt really forced, like it were added on later because it's popular. The new Blade Runner handled this much, much better. Thor: Ragnarok just felt slapped-together.",

Humour in this movie, however, I will say has gone too far- so much so, that it is attempting to make Thor a comedy.\n> The use of different accents for different characters seems to me to be a further attempt yo transform the story into a comedy, and I, personally very much disagree with it. It is plain silly!\n> Again this is my personal opinion : but there are some things that you just simply do not play around with : the concept of an English-speaking, highly vocal, beads-around-the-neck-wearing Hulk is simply laughable.\n> As a NZer, i can relate to the humor and (regardless of the disdain I have for the Kiwi director) do enjoy watching the movie... but the geek in me insists that some things are sacred :\nyou do not turn Thor into a comic character - Thor does not crack jokes (all the f*ing time)Hulk has been a well-known character for decades... you do not put beads around his neck and suddenly decide he's vocali enjoy a bit of humor... but thou shalt not go overboard!Personal opinion - obviously.\nMy two cents' worth!",

    "reviewTitle": "The last good movie of the MCU, the first in a long time...",
    "reviewBody": "The Good: It's a straight-forward comedy which is just one small step away from the giddy highs of the most iconic slapstick movies. There are a lot of action scenes, (usually the worst parts of any Marvel movie), but only a few of them are boring. (Hulk arena fight and a couple other forgettable ones). Led Zeppelin brightens some of the other fight scenes into camp. The plenitude of jokes mostly all land, why are Kiwis so good at doing this...? Jeff Goldblum plays himself on the planet he originally came from and it's hilarious. His no. 1 stooge is played by the same Kiwi actress who played the child welfare lady in Watiti's own Hunt for the Wilderpeople and she's even funnier here. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have their comic-duo routine down by now after rehearsal in Thor the Dark World. Mark Ruffalo exaggerates his own neurotic-ness so much you can only laugh at how ridiculous he is. There are actually several very funny verbal exchanges that left me impressed at the writers. Maybe Watiti should write more scripts. The designs are so refreshingly retro; I wish more modern movies looked as clunky as this. Overall it reminded me of Star Trek the Voyage Home: a Marvel movie for people who don't usually like Marvel movies. And, it's way funnier than the vapid losers who pass for comedians today, Kimmel, Colbert, Fallon, and all those other hacks.The Bad: The storyline is the same superhero dribble we've all seen a million times before and since; if it would have gone full-blown Bob Hope it could have been a 10-star movie, sure. The Asgard plotlines were kind of boring. On top of that, this is the biggest and most expensive insult to Norse mythology I have ever seen. The Norse Ragnarok was an incredibly serious and apocalyptic event and this movie reduces it to a punchline; people will now think of this screwy movie whenever it is mentioned. A lower-stakes comedic plot would have done wonders. Meanwhile, there are some green screens and CGI, but the humor mostly distracts from it. The shoe-horned in Doctor Strange scene should be excised, have a little respect for people watching this fifty years in the future who won't have the luxury of wasting 100+ hours of their lives watching repetitive Marvel films and keeping up with the mythology of them.The Ugly: The Valkyrie character teetered dangerously into the territory of a Jerk Sue, someone who is mean and rude but tolerated by all the characters.

    "reviewTitle": "Officially one of the worst movie trilogies in my book",
    "reviewBody": "Thor:Ragnarok, the very movie that got crazy praise, the movie that everyone is gushing over it. The movie that people claim it \"brought back\" the fun in superhero movies. But is it really worth all of this high acclaim? I can safely say that it doesn't. Just another over- hyped, generic garbage from the MCU. And to make stuff clear, no I don't hate \"fun\", and I am no elitist (be it as a comic book fan or as a movie Buff). I simply want a quality movie, no matter how its done or constructed. And this movie cares less about all of this and focuses way too much on humor that it overshadows other important elements of the movie. To explain myself, I have nothing against escapism. When the movie sells itself and doesn't lie about its nature (whether its a heist, a simple action film or just a comedy), I don't go there expecting a cerebral masterpiece. But I don't expect it to be a mindless filler that's sole existence is to kill 2 hours of my time without any other context or purpose whatsoever. So far, the movie is getting insane reputation, having high praise almost as other great comic book movies such as logan and the dark knight. But for these two movies, I can understand why logan and the dark knight get such high acclaim. Both completely reinvented the superhero genre in their own unique ways, by giving moral subtext and an engaging story. Thor:Ragnarok doesn't care about such. And yet its praised for its entertainment factor. Now ask yourself: is there really anything worth of such praise aside from how much \"fun\" the movie is? I still don't understand the praise for this movie. Its entertaining, but it is a bad movie. It's another proof that the MCU cares more about avengers movie than having a satisfying film. It exists solely to fill in the wait for infinity war.It suffers what other comic book movies do: there is no conclusion or a satisfying ending. They're focusing way too much on the next projects. Character development is almost non-existent, as well as character relationships. All of the relationships rely on cheap, gimmicky comedy instead of seeing real characters interacting with each other. None of the characters feel natural. In fact, it feels like the actors are merely cosplaying. And as usual, marvel shows they have no respect for the source material. I'm no comic book elitist, and my knowledge of Thor isn't that of a die-hard one, but I know enough to spot when the character is bastardized. I'm sorry, but a Thor who cracks jokes left and right while being captured and his home world being destroyed isn't who Thor is. Thor was more of a noble warrior who speaks in ye old English, almost Shakespearean style. The previous movies failed not because of the tone, but because the writing and acting was lazy, thus you don't care about him. And this movie suffers pretty much the same problem. And the other stories, as well as the hulk and Valkyrie, feel wasted. They are used unwisely. Both deserve better than just being in a film. In fact, planet hulk should have its own movie, not being a pointless subplot in a Thor film. And about the whole \"fun\" aspect, I hate that. I hate that mentality in which the movie is praised simply because its fun. Getting all of this love just because you are entertained. But aside from that? The movie has nothing to it. Its being treated like its the first fun comic book movie we had in years. Have people forgotten about guardians of the galaxy vol. 2? Or was it generic and forgettable that people DID forget it? Overall, over-hyped garbage that doesn't deserve any of the praise. One of the worst marvel movies, and the most disappointing movie of the year (even though I had no expectations)",

Any explications on how that works? No? Well it just does and Odin just dies because it is needed to further the plot. So there.We witness a fight between Thor and Hulk. Yes I would have liked to have seen that battle play out if it wasn't for the fact that Hulk looks more like an ogre than Bruce Banner's alter ego. I mean Hulk looks so cute in his armour, his hammer and his axe... Why this apparatus? Because we need to sell much more toys for Hulk. It's not enough to own a Hulk doll you need to push those greedy little brats to demand from their parents those extras. Which leads me to the other conclusion that this movie is for kids.Why did they waste the cameo appearances of Matt Damon and Sam Niell with such silly appearances? Hela, the goddess of Death who's power is to shoot magical swords at people and fight an entire army one at a time and raise an army of zombie warriors with magic fire. I just couldn't stop rolling my eyes when I saw Skurge, played by Karl Urban, firing a pair of M-16's with what seems to have a limitless amount of ammo (probably magical M-16's).Last, but certainly not least, the apparent TARDIS ship that comes to save the Asgardians. I call it a TARDIS ship for how else can you explain a ship that can take so many people in such a small space? Thor let his home be destroyed and is no hero for the fact. It was all part of the prophecy... so much for making your own fate.Now that a planet has been destroyed what is left for Marvel to blow up? The entire Universe maybe?",

    "reviewTitle": "Perhaps...Best Super Hero Film I've Seen...Top 3?",
    "reviewBody": "(Flash Review)And the most apropos usage of Led Zeppelin's \"The Immigrant Song\" I've ever seen! I did have recently loooow super hero movie expectations after seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. First off, this was actually really funny with the right tone of humor for a big movie like this. Such as super heroes using their super powers used for insignificant and routine things. There were actually good excuses for super heroes to battle each other rather than a rumble at an airport. The best part was the plot was well-written and compelling. The special effects felt...well...special. Basically, the plot is that Thor discovers that he has an evil sister who claims the throne of Asgard. Thor has been imprisoned across the universe and must fight in a gladiator match to free himself; his opponent turns out to be the Incredible Hulk. Good action fight ensues. Thor needs to resolve that predicament and get back to Asgard to save his home. Very fun and entertaining action movie!",

    "reviewTitle": "Ragnarock is flawed but good !",
    "reviewBody": "I just got home from Thor: Rganarock and boy, it was a fun movie. I am really happy that they went in a different direction with comedy rather then with the boring suffering and seriousness of Thor 1 and 2.Thor has short hair which works, mjollnir getting destroyed does not affect the story, and maybe will be a future objective for Thor to restore it in upcoming movies.They made the Hulk talk which is awesome, this also makes him have a personality and he becomes quite likable.Cate Blanchett is amazing as usual, also heads up for Idris Elba and Tom as usual, he being regarded as a fan favorite.As I mentioned there is a lot of comedy, but its not overused and this time it actually works, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 style, which gives a great tone to the movie.The end is maybe a little confusing, where Asgard is being destroyed. I mean Thor can't defeat Hela, but the fire monster can, but Thor at the beginning of the movie destroyed the fire monster ? Maybe cuz he had Mjollnir ? Whatever. I reckon they needed to destroy somehow Asgard to move the story forward, but they could have done it in a different way.Also very good visuals all around, but heads up for the scavenger trash planet looks absolutely amazing, they they made it look really sci-fi looking, the city, spaceships etc, like something you would see maybe in star wars, or blade-runner, well not actually but sort of, which is kinda good.The action is very good, the story is simple so there is not much not to like.All in all a very good viewing, if you like humour, good action go and see it.I give it a 9/10.",

    "reviewBody": "What Taika Waititi did for Thor is nothing short of miraculous. He took the most boring and stiff character in the MCU and made him the centerpiece of a space comedy. He completely rebranded Thor with a bright colors, a fresh haircut, and a wit that rivals Tony Stark.From start to finish, Thor: Ragnarok is incredibly fun to watch. It was genuinely funny, but it did not sacrifice emotion for shallow laughs. You still feel for Thor when his father dies, when mjolnir is destroyed and when he ultimately needs to unleash Ragnarok on Asgard.In addition, not only do we get to further the development of two brilliant recurring characters like Loki and Bruce but we are also introduced to exciting new characters like Valkyrie, Korg and the Grandmaster. When I think about going back and rewatching superhero films, Ragnarok is one of the top, if not at the top, of the list.",

    "reviewTitle": "Knew it would be good, but it turned out to be amazing.",
    "reviewBody": "I was generally unsure of whether I wanted to go see the movie at first - sure, it had appeal because of Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, and I very much enjoyed the first two Thor movies but this one looked a bit intense and zany to me from the trailer. BUT OH MY GOD I LOVED THIS FILM. EVERY MINUTE OF IT. It was really, really great! I did not at all expect to enjoy it just this much, I feel like I want to go see it again!The main thing that sets it apart from other Marvel movies is the comic quality, which unexpectedly comes mostly from Thor himself. Hemsworth was really wonderful in this movie, allowing us to see a more comic side to Thor certainly missing from a lot the first Thor film where he is far more serious. Then there's also Jeff Goldblum, who as a natural comic and entertainer, is just wonderful in his role as the eccentric Grand Master. I certainly didn't expect to laugh as much in this movie as I did, and literally at one point could not stop laughing from one of Thor's lines! Plus, the director's own role as Korg, the rock being, is an equally brilliant comic element within the film. The comedy combined with the amazing visuals as well as the zany and bizarre theme to the film which I believe is generated by the artistic direction of Taika Waititi makes this film a must-see. I was really pleased to see the progression of characters within this film without anything feeling forced by some agenda, it all just falls into place, especially in regards to Thor and Loki - the latter of whom I am particularly glad to see a ray of hope in the midst of his mischievous ways! Then, the introduction of Valkyrie is I think also a very good thing as she is a strong female character who surely has flaws but is also beautiful and bad-ass. Bruce Banner/The Hulk is also an interesting progression of character in the film - we actually see the Hulk speak instead of just always grunting and fighting, but then we realize Banner has actually been the Hulk for two years and hasn't transformed back so this is obviously something Banner struggles to come to terms with.Overall, I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of cheering up, it provides such a great escape from our daily realities and submerges you into a world of fantasy. The inclusion of LED ZEPPELIN'S IMMIGRANT SONG twice in the movie is also AWESOME!!!",

Valkyrie is a BLOND HAIRED BLUE EYED WOMAN in the comic, she is not a black woman with attitude which is all we seem to see these days in Marvel movies. Asgardians are warriors, but of course in this movie the population turns into a mass of scared people that have to be saved by a few people who wear armor or carry swords. Another star removed for the bad writing and plot hole. Casting Karl Urban as a bad guy is a WASTE of both his talents and acting ability. Its MUCH better than the normal SJW movies Marvel has been putting out but it could have been better.",

    "reviewTitle": "This movie is painfully awful, even for a Marvel film.",
    "reviewBody": "I was never a huge fan of the Thor movies, quite frankly I'm actually not a huge fan of the Marvel movies. Some are okay, while others are just complete and utter garbage.When I watch a Marvel movie, it's quite easy to know what to expect: stimulating action sequences, special effects, and an easy-to-follow story line. Basically, these movies are aimed towards a mass audience. The majority of the audience however is made up of 13-year-olds, while also making it JUST \"cool\" enough to appeal to maybe their parents or older siblings.You start to think, \"Okay, you know what, these movies aren't so bad. I could watch one of these once in awhile. They're fun, they're easy, and they're enjoyable on some levels.\" That's pretty much where Marvel movies stand with me.Anyway, back to Thor. I've always liked Thor over a lot of other Marvel movies because it was more serious. The Thor universe is that of Viking Norse myth legend and resembled that olden time of swords and shields and things. I'm a huge fan of fantasy so that reciprocated well with me. The first two Thor movies were decent at best. I wasn't in awe when the credits rolled, I didn't tell all my friends about it - but it was a decent watch, a good way to kill some time. It wasn't my desired movie experience by any means. Then again, I know what to expect when I watch a Marvel movie so movies like that have become sort of like a break for me from other movies that I try to watch.So I put on Thor: Ragnarok, hoping to get that fun, easy, pretty cool movie... And I came to find out that this movie is a steaming pile of hot garbage.What a complete turn in the wrong direction for the Marvel franchise and especially for the character of Thor, and the Hulk for that matter. Since when was Thor witty? Since when did the Hulk talk like a f**king baby rather than a pissed off green giant that's too big for his own good? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE?Let's name some other things wrong with this movie...\"Hey, Thor fans, remember everything vital to the storyline of Thor 1 and 2? You do? Okay, well just forget all of that because Thor has a sister! Yeah, he has a sister and Asgard actually became as prestigious and powerful because of her doing. Yup, yup... I know, it's f**king stupid but just roll with it okay?\"Yeah... also, everyone BESIDES Thor and Loki knew about their sister, Hela.More things wrong with this movie...\nThe music is bad. When Thor and Loki go to Earth, nobody notices them, ESPECIALLY LOKI WHO TRIED TO DESTROY THE EARTH (good job creating a Marvel universe). Everything involving Hela doesn't even matter in the end because Surtur destroys everything anyway. The planet Thor and Loki land on is like fruity Mad Max/John Carter land and isn't in the slightest bit interesting or has any character to it besides the fact that it's filled with garbage and there's a gladiator stadium. Characters like Korg and Miek actually mean nothing besides plans for the future in this s**tty franchise. Thor is restrained by the Grandmaster by a piece of metal in his neck that jolts him with electricity...\"Wait what? You're telling me that THE GOD OF THUNDER, who has lightning going through his veins is suppressed by a tiny jolt of electricity in his neck?\"Yeah... this movie is trash. I could sit here for hours telling you the things wrong with this movie and how bad the CGI is but I'll just wrap this up by saying this movie is painfully awful and you shouldn't waste your time sitting through it. When the movie is trying to be funny, it's not. Holy s**t is it not funny. However, when the movie is trying to be serious, it's hilarious.I'm so done with the Thor franchise. Seriously, how many times is Loki going to try to betray Thor and just get forgiven for it?The amount of positive reviews for this film is actually disgusting. If this is the direction Marvel is heading, I'm actually scared to see what comes next.",

    "reviewBody": "I really thought this movie would be better than it was but it was more like another Guardians of the Galaxy with a another super lame villain. Sorry but there was nothing great about Hela or Cate Blanchett's performance. Just another generic villain with a lame back story and all of sudden is Thor's sister. Also her powers were stupid. Cool you can shoot spikes...so powerful. Fenrir and Surtur were barely part of the movie and were lame as well. How can there be so many jokes going on when the Queen and King of Asgard are both dead and things are looking bad? Like your home is destroyed and you barely seem to care. Some other stupid parts of this movie:The warriors three die like immediately. They had good roles in the first 2 movies I guess their contract was up now. So let's kill them off. Odin barely has a part. Same with Doctor Strange. Heimdall was underused. Barely said anything and almost got killed by some undead soldiers. Seriously? This guy broke out of ice how could he almost die to some undead soldiers?Jane Foster, Erik Selvig, and Darcy completely missing. Tessa Thompson did not really add much to the movie either. Just another person to help get off Sakaar. Korg was funny but also similar to Tessa Thompson. Overall I felt like there was a lot of jumping around. From one planet to the next and Ragnarok was not that big of deal. If this movie never happened I do not think it would affect anything in the Marvel Universe especially if Hela and Surtur do not appear in Infinity War.",

    "reviewTitle": "Action-packed, great storytelling, very funny, and a well-deserved sequel.",
    "reviewBody": "Marvel Studios' Thor: Ragnarok is packed full of \"unthorgetable\" fun and exciting depth as part of one unforgettable saga. The film excels in its humour, with some scenes that deliver emotional moments with the complex relationship with brother, half-brother, and father (Thor, Loki, Odin) and a satisfying friendship with both the God of Thunder and the \"big guy,\" the tremendous, loveable Incredible Hulk. The story itself is brilliantly created also. Without Thor's hammer, according to reviews, he is \"still worthy.\"As the movie continues to strive in it's action, comedy, and the story, it certainly beats the opportunities of what Thor: The Dark World tried to conquer, and with it's threequel, characters like Heimdell get more shine until he is killed off by the Mad Titan (Thanos) in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War. From there on, it excels with the fascinating and well-created atmosphere of worlds such as Asgard, like it's predecessors, and the newly garbage planet Sakaar. The Hulk, after a few years of being absent from piloting the Quinjet in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Age Of Ultron, performs a top-notch portrayal with more of a humanised version, both he and the Mighty Thor are fantastic!The ending sets the stakes high with Infinity War just right round the corner, it gives fans the story and the performance what they deserve. This movie, as a whole, is funny, intriguingly emotional, and a likeable candidate to the MCU saga.A 9/10 to the Asgardians, to the big green guy, to the Sakaar people, and to the filmmakers behind this movie, \"because that's what directors do.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "Review for Thor: Ragnarok",
    "reviewBody": "One word for this movie. Awesome! Going into seeing the movie, I was super excited. When the movie was over I still had a huge smile on my face, both times I've seen it. Right from the beginning, the movie starts off with a bang. From the great comedic lines to the Led Zepplin music blasting as Thor wields his mighty hammer in battle. Which provided a great use of the hammer, considering it is destroyed early on.It might sound weird to say that the best part of a Thor movie is the comedy, but it's true. Ragnarok is hilarious and at times simply delightful. You can't help but smile and laugh when watching this film. Chirs Hemsworth as Thor is great with the comedic elements. Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster also adds a lot of fun to the movie. My surprise favorite character is the rock creature Korg. He's a great side character that provides brief moments of laughter. He's played by the film's director, Taika Watiti. From the trailers, we all knew that the Incredible Hulk was in the movie. The fight in the arena between Hulk and Thor was spectacular. Hulk is hilarious and does a great job smashing things. His alter ego Bruce Banner has some great moments in the movie, part of which is him struggling with his identity as Hulk. It's also great to see Loki back. He's still at his same old tricks, but a great moment is when he first sees the Hulk and immediately says that he needs to leave. Which is a great call back to their encounter in the first Avenger's movie. Two great additions to the Thor and Marvel movies are the two female leads. Hela played by Cate Blanchet and Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson. The villain of the movie, Hela, was a powerful and commanding threat against Thor. Valkyrie interacted so well with Hulk and Thor, and got her own character arc, fighting like a true warrior in the end.Benedict Cumberbatch's reprises his role as Doctor Strange in a short scene. Which is a continuation of the end credit scene he had with Thor at the end of the movie Doctor Strange. A couple of surprise cameos on Thor's home world of Asgard involve the people performing a play reenacting Loi's death scene from Thor: The Dark World. Unlike Captain America: Civil War, which felt more like an Avenger's movie, Thor: Ragnarok is very much a Thor film. The whole story revolves around Thor, characters from the Thor movies, and the realm of Asgard. This is the best Thor movie, and one of the most fun and delightful of any Marvel movies to date. The action is great, the comedy is hilarious and pacing keeps moving. There's not a boring part in the movie, and only increases my anticipation and excitement for the next Avenger's movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Unsuspected Cringefest",
    "reviewBody": "Do you know how much it sucks to say that this movie was a cringefest? Yes, that comes from someone who have actually enjoyed the previously hated Thor movies and who's Thor is my favorite Avenger. There were warning signs and for the longest time I was being very negative until I started seeing so many positive reviews of the movie. But instead ten minutes into the movie I get this gutted feeling that this is cringeworthy. That I hate the idea of having to sit through this all. Alright so the thing is I don't like sci fi so that wasn't a good sign. Why do I watch this kind of movie then? Again, I love Thor. I loved the second movie despite it's flaws because it had more of a historic/fantasy feel to it. It wasn't all bright and funny all the bloody time. It had moments with heart and even a lengthy funeral scene for a character we never really got much reason to love or to know. This movie? This movies re-introduces us to characters such as Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun. Then they're dead and gone within the minute never to be mentioned again. No time to feel one bit. No sad music. No reaction from Thor - his bestfriends. Just straight to humor and moving on. It was gut wrenching for all the wrong reasons.That's my major issue here. Any hope for heart this movie had was replaced with humor. And people praise it. Is this what people want? 80s video game with no pause. No heart. No character? Seriously? Hell yeah I admit the first Thor movies has their awful issues too, but as mentioned above I don't always need quality to enjoy a movie, but I do need some heart. I don't need all this f*cking humor.There are moments with so much potential for emotions without making it all so sappy, but still was ruined by humor. Thor and Loki talking and Thor tells his brother that he always loved and admired him from the get go but Loki never saw this. Then it's cut short with Thor thorwing Loki around. Why are you ruining the few moments of quiet and emotion with more bloody humor?This movie is called Ragnarok so the only thing it got going for it regarding that is that they actually do blow up Asgard. Full time! Kudos to that. Of course we get a moment of \"Aw shite\" and \"I might feel sadness, but it'll probably be \"funny\" soon too\" before that too turns out to be true. There's so much potential for good story telling and it wastes it.Let's try some of the positive things before I loose my mind eh? Fenrir the wolf shows up! Potential point wasted. So underused. He's massive and cool, but he doesn't really do that much. He fight Hulk and falls off the rainbow bridge. With a more serious movie with funny moments characters like this could be so cool and dark and used to the fullest!A lot of good actors, but with so little heart and soul I was just left feeling like they're... just there? Tom Hiddleston as Loki is missing something. He feels... forced? And looks disturbingly much like a certain Tommy Wiseau to the point it was horrifying! Chris is a funny guy and a good actor, but the humor isn't funny. Many of the characters are good and all. But not really given neither time or heart for much more. Again, potential? I loved Heimdall's part. Maybe because they reminded me more of the earthy fantasy feel of The Dark World than the SCI Fi of Ragnarok and I liked that? Heimdall in general was great. Almost surprised they didn't just kill him too as worthlessly as they did the worriors three. Probably because Idris Elba? Also liked Karl Urban's character. Might even have felt something when he sacreficed himself if they had given any reason to feel anything but supposed humor in this soulless money wasting movie. - Some parts of the final showdown was cool? Only moments though because again and again something else jumps in to ruin a moment. Usually humor. Or the music. The music is hideous again and just pulled me right back out of the movie. Thor, Valkyrie and Banner talk about how Loki always tries to kill someone and Thor tells an amusing story of how as an eight year old Loki turned into a snake. Thor tells this story in a way that is actually very funny for once. It was one of maybe three moments that got a chuckle out of me. Never a laugh. There might be some small moments in there that I liked too, but not worth wasting my time on anymore. People go on and on about how The Hobbit movies were just one big nasty CGI party, but what on earth was this then? In The Dark World at least they went to Norway to film the background scenery for Asgard. They filmed at Iceland for other planets... This movie is all CGI. All green screen. All bright colors and just no depths. Now that I have gotten this off my chest I'd rather move on and pretend this never happened.Superficial cringefest not at all worthy of any praise it has gotten.",

None of the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I would like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it even worse. If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might be fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and distractions instead of a good story and directing.",

    "reviewTitle": "By far MCU's best standalone movie. And Yes THOR RAGNA-ROCKS.",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok wastes no time cranking up its camp factor, which continues as he endures a \"prepare for the world's end\" rant from the massive demon Surtur. Thor repeatedly asks Surtur to pause his rant because he's slowly spinning around while hanging from a mess of chains. \"I feel like we had something there,\" Thor says while waiting for eye contact to return. The story is truly serious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCU villain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the new \"Revengers\" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favorite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. Cate Blanchett just nails her role as the goddess of death. She is the show stealer, her attitude her walk everything is just perfect. The fight scenes are just amazing. The CGI in those scenes are perfect. Humor in this movie is just marvelous. The last scene which displays the Thor force was icing on the cake. Believe me I am big DC fan but this movie is just mind blowing. Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act.  This movie is MCU's finest stand alone movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "More Like Guardians of the Ragnarok!",
    "reviewBody": "Yes, Guardians of the Galaxy did great (both parts), but that doesn't mean you are gonna recycle it again and again. This is Thor franchise, don't fuse and combine it with other space related series and make a mix-max mess. Both series have unique identity, you change Chris Hemsworth to Chris Pratt and vice-versa for the rest of the characters you got yourself GOTG-Part:2.5. The whole Thor realizing his powers and utilizing it against the main antagonist at the near is the same rehash of Star-lord using his new found powers at the end of part 2 and both scenes uses a soundtrack while both embracing the use of 80s science-fiction colorful style. You know there's one thing that seems to bother me a lot that everyone tends to forget while making a review of this movie is how Thor's old team from the previous two prequels gets easily killed off in the background without any remorse and painful cinematic scenes, just to be in the favor of introducing \"new characters\".-And Disney/Marvel back at it again with its usual PC culture and forced diversity. You know, your diversity really speaks of hypocrisy when it concerns itself with African-American people only. Yes, i get it and i really understand your ancestors were enslaved, as an Indian, my people were slaved too and maybe suffered a far more gruesome fate, but doesn't mean you are gonna show a white character getting slaved by a black character in the movie quietly and silently and let it slide and everyone will treat it as shits and giggle like this whole movie is. All sorts of controversy would be surrounding this movie if the same situation happened, but the roles were reversed. Anyway, back to the diversity topic, where are the Asian people? There was one guy who got killed in the first part and had a really really small and minor role. Now, should i be offended and \"triggered\" by this movie as for how it treats Asian people? I fear we are only gonna see more of it from here on in future, the marvel comics already suffers from it and the low sales fully describe they have hit new bottom low with Female thor, black captain America, black spider-man etc, next comes the MCU.:The reaction. Oh, how much i wish i would have never typed \"Thor:Ragnarok\" on google, i was still ready to give this movie 5.5 or 6/10 because at least it does a marvelous job at the CGI effects, we sure as heck came a long way from Thor I and any movie that utilize 80s synthwave and retrowave music is always a plus in my dictionary and gets extra scores just for that, but the amount of \"movie critics and journalists\" have given this 10/10 solely based on \"Queerest characters, most powerful blackest black person, how Valkyire is Bi and few other characters\" is just too darn high like what the heck? This movie never even explores anyone's sexuality, it doesn't even have any kind of romance at all, it is even less than subtle unless you force yourself to think that way and the fact that every review has one thing in common which is \"Bring both your boys and girls to watch this movie\". For the love of god, let it be just a kids movie for heck sakes, don't bring gender politics to them, they are just naive and innocent, i don't think they really care about such stuff. Conclusion:- Truly, the final nail in the coffin is when Thor gets enslaved by African-American female Valkyrie and gets his arse handed over by her all the time, she even kicks Loki's arse. If she is really that strong even stronger than Thor, then why just not make her the main protagonist? She just alone can go to Asgard and save everyone and call it a day and go back to her drinking habits by night. The worst part out of all just check \"Tessa Thompson\"'s twitter and her blunt hate for men and how she does't care what Boys/Men thinks about her sexuality of her character in the movie even though it is mostly women who are asking her just to satisfy their \"curiosity\".",

    "reviewTitle": "God of LIGHTENING and a game of spot the mistakes!",
    "reviewBody": "This contains spoilers and some of the very visible and laughable mistakes you can see in the movie. First, it's not a bad watch if you're not really that much of a Thor fan. If you're a general superhero movie fan and under the age of 33-30 chances are you'll like it. But if you absolutely loved the comics, this movie will put you off American movies for quite some time. First, Thor is the god of LIGHTENING, thunder and storms, not the god of thunder alone. So it was retarded to see his enemies control him using a small electric chip that's about 120 volts (if that judging that it was used to control humans too), while the god of lightening can handle more than trillions of volts going through his body and eyes. Second, Thor is obviously a retard. He doesn't know that he's the god of lightening. He thought he lost his ability to act because he doesn't have a hammer any more only ttill his dead father reminded him. How many years did he practice his godliness again? In fact, Thor in this movie is weak, rash, stupid, good at begging, not the smartest cookie and has the charisma of teen. I'll flash my big arms and you be impressed, OK? Please? I feel sorry for Chris Hemsworth he's gonna be stranded in this stupid role for a long time. Third and last: They chop the beautiful blonde locks of Thor and give him a haircut that looks cheap, dark and stupid. I'm sorry but what's left of Hemsworth's head is so tiny and even more dwarfed by his massive torso. His head looks like a single lost cherry on top of a twelve tier wedding cake. Out of proportion and doesn't look right. -Tessa Thompson acts as if she spent her entire life watching cheerleader movies. Superficial, pouty, posey and faaaaaakkkkee. She's a very beautiful woman but boy is she effing boring! I laughed when the Asgardian army knelt to launch their weapons at Hela (or whatever reason they knelt for) then she introduced herself and commands them to kneel. They're already kneeling. Blindness runs in the family as this is not the only time this happens. Kate Blanchett has never looked better. I never thought of her as sexy till now. But the acting was lame in many parts. Anthony Hopkins... dear oh dear... this man has been acting as if he's epic bored of the whole industry. Can he just retire or hasn't sorted out his bills yet? He's my favourite actor by inertia.. I've been waiting for at least ten years to see him show us again what he's really capable of. Editing errors are rife. I'm an absent minded goof yet could easily spot them. The clear change in the shoulders of Hela's costume as she invaded the Bifrost for the first time, the erratic foot positioning of the zombie soldiers on the bifrost, the positioning dots (they look like laser pen beams) on the graves of a couple of soldiers as Hela throws the eternal flame, the wrong sequence of dry/sweaty arms and face on Thor's body as he kneels to take counsel if his dead father, greasy/curly hair changes Loki suddenly suffers from as he tricks Thor before decoding the spaceship, and many more. Generally the acting was horrendous, the dialog a disaster and the logic messed up. However, in an unprecedented event, the music is ten times better than the movie and it's why I gave this movie 5 out of ten. Otherwise, it would be 2 stars if that",

    "reviewTitle": "Tried to mainstream the movie, failed miserably",
    "reviewBody": "I'm not sure if this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but Disney tried hard to make it one, and they failed miserably. Their attempts at humor make it hard to take anyone or anything seriously. Furthermore, it severely undermines the falling of Asgard, and it causes much of the film time to be wasted on cheesy lines that have no relevance to the story.If this were the first movie of the Thor franchise, okay then my review would be much more favorable. But this is the 3rd movie of the franchise (and the 6th movie of the MCU that Thor has appeared in). You can't just completely change characters' personalities once they have already been previously established. Everyone wasn't their usual selves. The Thor from all of the previous movies would not have taken the seize of Asgard as light-hearted as he did in this story.To make things even worse, the movie chose to play \"Immigrant Song\" during Asgard's last battle. Seriously?? This battle took place on Asgard, not Earth! A battle like this should be met with intense instrumental music, not contemporary music that comes from Earth.This shows that Disney was clearly trying mainstream the movie to all audiences and was willing to rip the movie of any genuine authenticity.Sadly, it actually worked. It was a box office hit. So congrats Disney. You successfully sold out Thor.Also, half the movie is a ripoff of Gladiator.",

    "reviewTitle": "It is one of the best movie of THOR Series",
    "reviewBody": "Plagued by visions of Ragnarok -- that is, the death of the gods and the end of Asgard -- Thor (Chris Hemsworth) moves to avert the long-foretold disaster in THOR: RAGNAROK. After suffering a terrible personal loss, the son of Odin discovers life-changing truths about Asgard, his family, and the true threat. He finds he must escape captivity and recruit friends both new (Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie) and old (Mark Ruffalo as Hulk) for an epic confrontation against the most powerful forces he's ever faced (namely, Cate Blanchett as Hela, Goddess of Death).The Marvel Cinematic Universe's most audacious entry so far, Thor's third stand-alone movie goes there with wild, bold choices -- and it succeeds, epically, on many levels. Thor: Ragnarok is a triumphant unification of diverse MCU elements. It's as gonzo-funny as the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, it steps up the sci-fi from those and the Avengers entries, it expands on the best mythological threads of the previous Thor films, it introduces exciting sword-and-sorcery action, and it even allows for real, believable character growth. Director Taika Waititi and the screenwriters have realized that all these things exist simultaneously in this ever-expanding storytelling cosmos, and they embrace it all. Ragnarok has dragons and demons and the Goddess of Death, spaceships and lasers and wormholes, gladiatorial combat and revolution, and even some magic in the form of a Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) crossover. Not ony does Waititi stir these ingredients together with the aplomb of a mad-but-brilliant chef, but he boldly adds his own special sauce with his quirky humor and even the use of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\" as a kind of new, perfectly chosen theme for Thor.We've seen hints of it before, but Ragnarok fully unlocks Hemsworth's Thor as a likable comic figure capable of personal growth. He's actually evolving into the great king he must become, while getting funnier with each appearance. The return of Ruffalo's Hulk is more than welcome -- so much so that the only complaint with the film's eye-popping action is there isn't enough of him in the final battle. Even Anthony Hopkins, as Odin, gets to have some fun doing his version of Odin-as-played-by-Loki. Among the newcomers, Thompson shines as the conflicted, swaggering, too-cool-for-Asgard Valkyrie (though her alcoholism-of-the-gods drinking problem isn't addressed at all by the film). The most lovable of the new characters is the gentle, blue rockpile-revolutionary warrior Korg, voiced winningly by Waititi. And as Hela, Blanchett kills it. Hela was co-created by one of the greatest comic artists of all time, Jack Kirby, and, unlike some superhero movies, Ragnarok dives deeply into Kirby's incredible designs. The two-time Oscar-winning actress achieves the full Kirby, chewing the scenery with razor-sharp fangs and eyes shining with malevolence while looking comic-panel perfect doing it. This isn't a perfect movie: The brightly lit, candy-colored cinematography and production design sometimes feel inappropriate. And major characters are killed and quickly forgotten. (Speaking of which, where's Sif?) But those are quibbles with a movie that, from its opening scene (easily the most thrilling in the MCU to date), incites a head-banging \"right on!\" Waititi, previously best known for small, personal comedies like What We Do in the Shadows and his work with Flight of the Conchords, passes his first big-canvas test with flying colors.It is one of the best movie of THOR Series.",

    "reviewBody": "Ugh, I really really hated this movie entirely. I was hoping for the heart of Wonder Woman or Lord of the Rings in Epic Quality, I got none of that. I honestly wanted to leave the theater, and mind you that is quite a feat to get me to not want to watch a film anymore. Last movie to hold this distinction of me wanting to leave the theater was that awful live action Scooby Doo movie. I was not wanting to see a comedy but an epic, Shakespearian Drama with realistic humor in small quantities in it like the first one was. I got none of that as well. The only thing I did like was Cate Blanchett as Hela. What bothered me the most was that people were getting killed and maimed by Hela but golly gee! Let's crack another childish joke!!!! Imagine if Game of Thrones was a juvenile comedy like this movie? Thank the Old Gods and the New that GOT is realistic in it's character portrayals. When all is said and done I am just not going to watch another Marvel movie in the theater again. I should have trusted my instinct and not gone like I did with Thor: The Dark World, but I stayed for my mother and that's all. If DC betrays me with Justice League I'm just swearing off modern comic movies altogether and just relying on all my old DVDs of the great Comic movies like the first 2 Raimi Spider-mans, Nolan's Batman movies and X2 to remind me when Comic Movies actually had heart, not the Chaching of the cash register. I felt like Ragnarok completely insulted my intelligence. I grew up with the Christoppher Reeves Superman, I still love the first two Raimi Spidey movies, and the first two X-Men movies as well as Nolan's Batman movies. All of these franchises had quality, intelligence and heart, not treated as a comedy to appeal to the stoner generation and their simple minds. Marvel has let me down and I refuse to waste my money and two hours of my life on unenjoyable experiences anymore so I refuse to go see another Marvel film in theaters.P.S. And here's the spoiler, can someone please tell me exactly why they unnecessarily made Hela Odin's daughter and not Loki's Daughter from the past as in the continuity that has been around for decades? Did they not think that people could wrap their heads around the fact that Loki, most likely in his moment of freedom from Asgard between Thor and Avengers, time traveled and impregnated Hela's mother in the past?",

    "reviewBody": "I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie, but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, there aren't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. The Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he's always been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It works though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always. Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the way Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardly any background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he's just a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss a little seriousness at certain moments in the movie.

The first movie lacks action and brothers touch..\nThe second was emotional, extremely exciting, best fights, serious moments, powerful and mighty scenes that thor created. And everyone participated in the movie.Both had \"NECESSARY COMEDY\" to lighten some scenes..This one is a Joke literally. I had such deception after watching the powerful and mighty THOR. Into a cheap clown.What a waste of using an ELITE actor as Anthony Hopkins. To be ridiculous (Loki disguised as Odin) and also only a few minutes to say goodbye. By the way worst scene. Probably no one felt the parenting feeling of a father to his sons.Also a great actress. To be a funny joke. She was supposed to be one of the worst enemies that thor might face and she wasn't threatening just sassy and bratty. She's beautiful but with the obvious CGI horns looked lame. I know the horns are part of the comic book but using them one time might do the trick. Not all the time.Heimdall appeared just 10 minutes just to do very extra things.Loki the LITERALLY GOD OF MAGIC and mischief. Probably more than 100 years old. It's treated like a fool against doctor strange a rookie on magic. Lame sceneThe fight of Thor against Hulk supposed to be legendary (like ironman and cap America) but only a few punches and it was more haha hehe scenes. Probably more jokes than fight.The executioner is a very very but really very extra character in the movie. He just did 2 things and that's it. But hey. He did more than heimdall.Very american jokes.

I mean the protagonist loses some very close people to him and his whole world but hey instead of showing some emotion why not just throw in some more lame one liners and jokes. I could hear crickets in the cinema. The few people who laughed were forcing themselves i think lol. It was utter garbage. On the other hand Justice league even though it had its faults was pure awesome. At least they got the characters right instead of the more joke better review formula Marvel has adopted. Thor is not even close to its source comic material. And don't get me started on the awful CGI. Don't waste your money....",

    "reviewBody": "While not reaching the cerebral heights (at least in THIS genre) offered by Kenneth Branagh's first installment of the Marvel Studios study of the God of Thunder, 2011's \"Thor,\" this third version (the less written about Alan Taylor's \"Dark World,\" the better) is certainly a wild, fun ride and a worthy edition to the sub franchise.Directed by Taika Waititi (\"Boy,\" \"Hunt For the Winter People\"), this project features the parental and sibling angst so prominently displayed in the last two films and continues as Thor (Chris Hemsworth, the horrid remakes of \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Vacation\") the natural son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins, \"Transformers: The Last Knight\") battles his rebellious adopted bro, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, \"Kong: Skull Island\"), only this time there's a twist.It's as Darth Vader once said, \"So, you have a SISTER,\" and the two are soon informed that upon Odin's death (the franchise's second or third, so far), the daughter, Hela (multi-Golden Globe winner Cate Blanchett, \"Manifesto\") — born first — is baaaaack and, by the way, just happens to be the Goddess of Death, for whatever THAT designation is worth (remember Aries in \"Wonder Woman\"?).Her arrival in the mythical kingdom of Asgard ushers in the Ragnarok (Korangar spelled backwards), which we suppose means, literally hell on earth (or in Asgard, anyway), which necessitates the feuding brothers join forces to take on Hela and her minion army of long-dead soldiers (yes, yes, we know, just like the good guys in \"Lord Of the Rings: Return Of the King,\" as well as \"The Mummy 3: The Emperor's Tomb\" had to deal with).Here, though, the sons of Odin are aided in this quest by stock Marvel characters Bruce Bannon/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, \"Now You See Me 2\") and Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), along with a dull and drunken Valkyrie (or Amazon) warrior, Tessa Thompson (\"Creed\") and a host of revolting peasants (take that anyway you want to).Of course, we know demise and destruction will follow, but even invincible deities are vulnerable in films like this and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" is no exception. Also expect the fire, fights, explosions and other Marvel pyrotechnics and terrific action sequences so prominent in these efforts, as well.What many viewers may NOT expect, however, is just how humorous and witty this vehicle happens to be. The inclusion of Jeff Goldblume (\"The Grand Budapest Hotel,\" \"Independence Day: Resurgence\") as a planet's smarmy \"Grandmaster,\" who runs that world's gladiator contest that features the duel between Thor and Hulk, along with a lot of lively word play and real comedy obviously inspired by \"Deadpool\" and the \"Guardians Of the Galaxy\" series.There is also a hilarious send up of the series with Matt Damon (the upcoming \"Downsizing\"), Sam Neill (\"Jurassic Park\") and Luke Hemsworth (\"Westworld\" TV series).Still, no Marvel film would be complete without the amazing special effects, here directed by Brian Cox (\"Gold,\" \"Silence\") and fantastic art direction (Bill Booth, \"Kong: Skull Island\").Chris Hemsworth was obviously born for this role, even though his acting talent often struggles to keep up with his powerful hammer (though here he acquits himself rather well), while Hiddleston is a much better thespian and a delightful (if extremely incompetent) villain, but in \"Ragnarok,\" it's really Blanchett who steals everything complete with a slimming black leather suit and jet black hair that turns into antlers.Now THAT'S frightening",

    "reviewBody": "Enjoyable movie, I want to start with that.The story is simple and predictable but it works. You don't go to these kind of films for the intricate plots.The action is great and the cgi is mostly awesome! Unfortunately some characters are below the standard we all have come to expect, especially the directors own character Krog. I don't know what happened there at all.But the cgi isn't my biggest concern, it's the humor. I laughed and enjoyed the movie but it was very distracting because it never stopped. So many cheap laughs, it was almost like a spoof more than the real thing. I got the feeling from the clip on Youtube of \"Team Thor\".The characters lack depth because of all the humor and I feel like Marvel are redirecting its movies to fit a younger audience. I feel like the volume of comic relief is what keeps this film from being a great one, just like Guardians Vol.2.The movie is enjoyable, bright, fun, colorful and with an awesome soundtrack. If you like that kind of movie this is the one for you! I miss Thor and Hulk/Banner from the other movies and would have liked to have had a movie with those characters instead of these comedic versions.",

    "reviewBody": "Nothing will beat the first Thor movie for me but this more lighthearted take on the third instalment is refreshing. I don't hate The Dark World but I don't particularly like it either. Loki was definitely the best part of that film hands DOWN! He's cool as sidekick here but it's great to see Thor have a relatively good time (along with the rest of the cast and characters). Hela is an awesome villain who shouldn't have been killed off so soon but all-in-all it's a fun movie. Bruce was cool. But I HATE the freaking HULK! Definitely refreshing before the darker tone of Infinity War!",

    "reviewBody": "I really don't want to hate this movie.First of all, the characters personalities have been neutered, to the point where they're basically bad joke/self referential one liner vending machines.And I hate to use an overused joke considering the movie I'm reviewing, but...Take a shot of alcohol every time there's a joke that doesn't add to the plot or characters, try and make it through the first half, in fact, forget that, try and make through the first fifteen minutes, you'll be very drunk.Also, for a movie with such a colourful poster, why does the movie itself look so dull? Asgard in the first two movies looked so grand, and shiny.In this movie, while there's technically more colour, it feels more flat.It's like the cinematographer turned the brightness up to the absolute maximum, and the contrast down to the absolute minimum so instead of the colours standing out, the picture looks mostly white and grey.One of the more stranger things I felt with this movie, is that it feels like the filmmakers hate all the characters, except for maybe Heimdall.Thor and Loki are constantly falling over, getting hit in the head, and getting electrocuted, which in Thor's case doesn't make sense, since he can shoot lightening at the end.Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun are just killed off in their first scenes, and Thor doesn't even react or find out.Sif isn't even mentioned in this movie.Hela's the villain, so yeah I'm not surprised there.Valkyrie is just an alcoholic who kidnaps people for money, and yeah that's about all there is to her character, yeah the villain killed her wife but at the end when she's fighting Hela, she doesn't say, \"That was for my lover\" or anything related to that, that little bit of back story just felt pointless.Skurge, he basically has no character, he's just fed info by Hela, turns good again at the end, then dies.Bruce Banner, he's just here so the producers could put The Hulk on all the posters and in all of the trailers, other then that, he doesn't have a character ark, he just falls over a lot, gets hit in the head a bunch, and he says unfunny one liners, basically the same as Thor and Loki.And finally Odin, what really surprised me with this specifically, is how the writers added a bunch of backstory to Odin's character, to just ignore it.Basically Odin and Hela went around conquering and committing genocide on different worlds.You'd think being Odin's son, Thor might have some sort of emotional response to this, but just like with Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun, he doesn't even find out, so it's just as useless.And last of all here's a question I bet even people who like this movie can't answer, What is the theme/message of this movie?Because I can name the themes/messages for the first two movies just fine.The theme/message for Thor (2011) \"Killing people just for disagreeing with you, only creates enemies\"The theme/message for Thor The Dark World \"Forcing your people to give up their lives for their land is no less brutal then mass genocide\"The theme/message for Thor Ragnarok, after weeks of thinking \"Forcing people, to do things against their will is fine, as long it's the good guys who are forcing them\"\nIt's a shame when a series starts off by simply being, and doing its own thing.But then the producers start listening to the people who weren't even fans to begin with, and they turn it into an obnoxious, cynical, condescending, self parody, that I didn't walk out on, because I still like the MCU.",
