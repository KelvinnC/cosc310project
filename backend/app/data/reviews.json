    "reviewTitle": "Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period.",
    "reviewBody": "Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.\nClearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed \"Fear City.\"This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself \"God's lonely man\" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.\nThe Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best in Venice. Best CBM of all time? Perhaps.",
    "reviewBody": "Joker (2019) is ambitious, tragic, meritorious, a dark comedy, exhilarating, and a masterpiece in cinematic storytelling. Director Todd Phillips, after several questions over his ability to direct a praiseworthy Joker film, delivers a classic movie that will be forever enshrined in the memories of those fortunate enough to experience it. Phillips deconstructs the superhero genre and turns it on its head, forming a film that feels and IS an artful indie film rather than a prototypical A to B superhero movie. Every scene in the film has purpose for Phillips. There is a love for the story being told and a direct care in the manner it is portrayed. And for this Phillips should be praised. He navigates the complexities around the character of the Joker, introducing a fresh take while also attempting to pay homage to movies such as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Yet, the movie never falters, not even for a second. It moves through each scene not just feeling new, but breathtaking beautiful that will have you applauding before the credits even roll.Likewise, the details in this film are remarkable, as Phillips not only has one listen to the film, but we actively live in it. We can feel the nasty, garbage-filled streets of Gotham often represented through careful and strategic use of symbolism. But of course, while the movie itself is remarkable, it needs an anchor - the great Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix delivers the most jaw-dropping performance in a film of the 2000s, and perhaps one of the greatest and most memorable performances of all-time. While the character already complex, Phoenix dives so much into the role that you can hardly recognise him. He is at times funny, delicate, innocent, sometimes he is tragic, heartbreaking, and at times he is the dangerous, horrifying, and unpredictable. Through his complex play on the ranging emotions of one Arthur Fleck, Phoenix becomes the epitome of the Joker.So is this the best comic book movie of all time? For most moviegoers that will be the question. And this film transcends the genre in a manner that has not been done since 2008. Likewise, while the Joker movie is more of a tragedy or even comedy than it is a superhero movie (imagine an indie film with DC characters), with the inclusion of superheros, or supervillains in this case, it will always be a superhero movie.So where does it stand amongst other CBMs? It is top 2, battling with another film that featured the Joker, The Dark Knight.",

This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.",

    "reviewBody": "What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.",

You can have a good acting performance (in this case Joaquin Phoenix) andbat the same time have an, IMO, very average film labeled as a DC film aka a comic book film but really it just being a character film of th making of a serial killer. In this case Joker is absolutely false advertisement. Should have been called Arthur or Decent into Madness. I went in expecting a complex story and what o got was a mix of Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, some Joker Gotham tie ins and an,IMO weak script and plot. I will be in the minority in this age of hype but this movie is not on the scale of true masterpieces like Se7en, Leon, The Usual Suspects. Joaquin may get nominated for awards but as film I would not nominate this film due to its weak script. The best in the film, the acting of Joaquin and the cinematography. Everything else is meh.",

    "reviewTitle": "A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick",
    "reviewBody": "I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",

    "reviewTitle": "''Joker wants to be a movie about the emptiness of our culture. Instead, It's a prime example of It''",
    "reviewBody": "Until now, the only review of this movie that I mostly agree with is the review from The Times. I stole the title of this review because it just hits the nail on the head.In the first impulse, I didn't even want to watch this movie, because I'm just fed up with the Joker. DC has many, much more interesting villains than Joker. It's time to tell stories about them and not constantly repeat the Joker's story, where there is no chance to say anything new, because in fact the Joker is not an interesting story at all, anymore. A rejected, angry man, who fails in life, a clown who becomes a killer - story as old as the world.Everything that could be said about Joker, said Nolan in the Dark Knight Trilogy, plus various comics and yes - Batman and Joker cartoons too. Nolan also told the Joker story more subtly than this movie, not only by the whole story structure, but also excellent dialogues. People who, I already see, claim in the reviews, that it is this film, that fully reflects the depth of the Joker character or that it is such a successful '' artistic '' film - they simply try to cast a spell on reality, giving the film a meaning that doesn't exist .In Nolan Trilogy Joker is really The Joker - madman, but with hatred and goal to burn the world down. Joker kills Rachel which Bruce never gets over. Alfred burns Rachel's last words to save Bruce from more pain. In an attempt to save Bruce from confronting Bane, Alfred disarms him with the truth even if it means saving his life. Even tho he isn't mentioned in the 3 film, you see how Joker messed up the characters in this film . But he isn't the ONLY ONE who beat Batman in this trilogy. All the villains beat Batman in one way or another. Ra's broke Batman's will, Scarecrow broke his mind, Joker broke his spirit, Two-Face broke his hope, Bane broke his body, Talia broke his heart, hell even Catwoman broke his trust early on....Joker didn't know Batman's identity. He didn't even plan to torment Bruce for years.....But the effects of his actions in the previous film TDK are felt in the third one. By corrupting Dent, both Batman and Gordon had to stage a cover up - we see Gordon struggling to deal with this lie, praising the man who almost killed his child. The lie he told 8 years ago for the greater good is eating him up inside. Then there is Bruce - Joker may not have known his identity but he certainly deduced that Rachel meant something to Batman. Joker kills too many people to force Batman to remove his mask and Dent boldly steps up to claim he's Batman. Rachel sees this on the news and is disappointed that Bruce did nothing to intervene and it's arguable this is what drives her to write the letter choosing Dent over Bruce. It is this same letter Alfred burns to spare Bruce more pain, thus leading to the bitter break-up between Bruce and Alfred.This third movie is the aftermath of the Joker's actions and how the characters and city of Gotham are coping with it after 8 years. TDKR feeds off the relevance of its predecessors like any good third installment. 8 years of false peace covering a giant lie and watching that lie eat at Bruce, Gordon and the city.The lie that enabled The Dent Act to be passed, removing organized crime and as a result removing the need for a Batman. The rich and elite benefitting from the clean streets while the middle class and poor gap widens.The fact that Batman and Gordon had to lie proves to the League that Gotham is truly beyond hope and must be destroyed.And a lie that caused Bruce and Alfred to break up....Joe Chill broke his happiness when he pulled the trigger and fired the bullets that killed his parents and also Falcone and Maroni were indirectly responsible for Batman's birth, and what makes Nolan's trilogy a masterpiece is indeed how each of his enemies are responsible for major tragedies in his life or events that will scar him for life and as for the enemies he fought in the trilogy. I would say that The Joker (not only cause he's the archenemy) is the one who got under his skin in the most personal way not only by killing Rachel but by corrupting the \"honest and perfect\" White Knight but because he forced Batman to take on a role that in Batman's eyes it would be best for him by sparing the truth of who the real white knight was when he was pushed to his limits.Nolan put in each film the right villains needed for all 3 stories. Not only are they responsible for tragedies in Bruce's life, but they mirror Bruce like some twisted perversion of what he could have been IF he crossed the line of an executioner. This is for me one of the most interesting elements of Batman from the source material.Him never crossing the line his villains deliberately or accidentally cross is what he uses to check himself so he doesn't end up like them. In Rises there are many instances where I actually thought Bruce wouldn't make it! Seeing a hero humiliated and vanquished was so unexpected and effective it made me actually care for Bruce more than ever! There was a lot at stake this time around... More emotional layers are in the third film.The problem with THIS movie is that the creators here openly say, that Joker is mentally ill. What?! This is a parody of the whole idea of The Joker. Yes, he is a sadist and psycho, but not in the sense of '' crazy ''. Besides, this movie is also full of cheap and failed imitations and quotes from movies like Taxi Driver or the Nolan Trilogy, Why do so few people notice it? This is not a breakthrough film, it is a mixture of everything that came before. Infantile psychology at the level of high school dramas for teens and the plagiarism of many other outstanding films. Making a '' serious '' movie about Joker is possible only thanks to Nolan, he, thanks to his Trilogy, has changed the approach to the whole genre, '' Batman Begins '' was the start of the more serious approach to the superheroe movies overall in cinema (Begins was released before Marvel movies).But of course everything about the most popular villain of all time - Joker - is promoted on a gigantic scale and in this particular case, '' The Joker'', the rest of the sheep followed it. Phoenix is a great actor, no doubt, but in my opinion the whole movie - script and direction - is full of clichés hidden under the guise of the social commentary that is another primitive truism.I will quote the Times review again, because it is excellent at exposing the shallowness and pseudo-artistic nature of this film : ''The movie's cracks - and it's practically all cracks - are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it's imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, 'Everybody just screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore.' Who doesn't feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur's observation is one of those truisms that's so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.''Another problem of '' The Joker '' is a very chaotic structure, which means that there is not too much entertainment and pure cinema in this movie. After some time it just becomes boring mess.What was great about Nolan was that Nolan was able to combine the features of commercial, mainstream and independent film in one and what he said was authentic. He knew that such a film must also be entertainment, but he didn't limit The Trilogy to it. This accusation, which Nolan haters often repeat - that Nolan is pretentious is not true, especially in Dark Knight trilogy (because I can agree that Inception is terribly pretentious). In TDK Nolan doesn't arrogantly run away from mainstream, because he fully understood what it takes to make epic, successful superhero movie, but at the same time, he added depth to this story, by exploring both the dark and the altruistic side of Wayne / Batman and exploring, but not overdoing the Joker.Nolan Trilogy revived the genre without a doubt. We talking about real change - originality in the approach, but still entertaining. Nolan's version was finally epic tale about moral choices, tragic fate, true heroism of a man but also our weaknesses and about evil personified in Joker- evil which very often is just trivial, but still destructive as great Michael Caine/Alfred says : ''Some men just want to watch the world burn''. So no matter how many great superhero movies will come and how critics will judge them, Dark Knight Trilogy is in history books, because it changed the genre, just like Pulp Fiction changed gangster films. Before DKT, superhero movies were very schematic and mostly drab. Now they are mostly sophisticated, every director wants to do something new and original or simply more within the genre and they are all following Nolan's footsteps.Whereas Joker by Todd Philiphs is the quintessence of pretentiousness and fakeness. There is nothing authentic in this movie. It is a collection of cheap fanfiction, quotes from movies like Taxi Driver&Nolan Trilogy (even if Todd said he did it to pay tribute to Scorsese and Nolan, it turned out clumsy), poured with sauce of pop culture tricks. Phoenix battered body twists and turns on the screen, but there is no soul in this creation. Time to say goodbye to Joker, DC. You have much better villains in your stable, whose story can be fascinating to tell. The Joker ceased to be interesting long time ago. Btw, Batman has always been a more interesting character to me, because although he is a superhero, he is also the only such a popular superhero, who has so much darkness, killer impulse, but also humanity inside of him (and Bale showed all of this masterfully in Nolan trilogy). The ambivalence is fascinating here. The Joker is a wounded clown, nihilist, murderer. This story is told in the cinema several times a year. There is nothing fresh about it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Probably one of the best comic book movies out there with a performance of Phoenix that will make you speechless at the end #Venice76",
    "reviewBody": "Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.\nBut still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\nI'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76",

    "reviewTitle": "DC's masterpiece. Although a huge risk for the studio -- it paid of. A lot.",
    "reviewBody": "I had the chance of seeing a screening of Joker at the Venice Film Festival last week. 'Joker' was easily one of the highlights of the festival thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's breathtaking performance and Todd Phillips' clever directing.Although the movie consists of an amazing supporting cast, you mostly watch the movie through Arthur's (Joker's) lenses. Arthur is present in every scene of the movie, ala taxi drive. The movie clearly draws inspiration from Scorsese's 80s work (most notably from Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy. There's a lot of nods and easter eggs for the fans of those two movies). The gotham city we see in this movie is the most corrupt version to date, which is to be expected when our beloved caped crusader doesn't exist. It's a nightmarish vision of New York where corruption, crime and chaos are the leading forces behind everything. The story takes clever twists and turns that will leave even the most hardcore and well-read DC fans with their jaws on the floor. I wish I could talk about them but I don't want to go into spoilers. As for Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the clown prince of crime, there's really not much to say that you haven't read already. Phoenix literally transforms into both the role of Arthur Fleck and the Joker, giving us a super realistic and groundbreaking performance that even the Oscars cant snob. Joker is a strong contender for best picture.This movie is a must watch for both comic book and drama fans alike. It's a deep character study of a mentally ill man slowly sinking into madness that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone.Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 from me. I cant wait to see more small budget comic book movies about other DC villains (or heroes!).",

This movie is a masterpiece and you can see that for yourself just by looking at the rating. No movie in the history of IMDB has been at 9.6/10 for this long. No more words to say but i just cant explain the greatness of this movie. Just give it a shot and go to the theaters its definitely worth the money. Hope you enjoy it like i did! (Sure you will😃)",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Joker of all will knock your sox off",
    "reviewBody": "The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a \"comic book film\". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.\nBasically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as \"The Joker\", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a \"condition\" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three \"respectable\" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian \"Arthur Fleck \" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is \"I have a condition\" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense.",

For some reason in between all the actors who did the Joker's character , heath ledger did reach a point where no one can reach or far beyond reach ! If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the movie again and you will know ! But that doesn't necessarily will prevent me from watching Joaquin's version ! Or even liking it ! Joaquin without doubt is an excellent actor , he's already proven to be in many previous roles and I'm sure he will add to the character some of his brilliant performance but I believe the movie needs more than Joaquin's Talent to beat Heath's version of the joker !

The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\nThe movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.",

This is less \"The Dark Knight\" and more \"Taxi Driver\" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves.",

Gotham truly is a cruel city and you end the movie questioning whose side you're on.The links to to Wayne family in this picture also grow the folklore around the Joker-Batman dynamic and you get a greater sense as to why their stories are so intertwined. Really classy touch.Going into this, I felt this 2hour + movie would drag but each and every scene meshes well together, the 1st act makes you grow attached to Arthur as he battles against these demons in his life and the middle & final acts pay your patience with a bunch of twists & turns that you didn't see coming.Worth every second, tightly written script and I can't wait for what DC has in store for us moving forward with these stand alone features. 10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "Led by a stunning Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is an instant classic",
    "reviewBody": "Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5",

This is a MUST SEE pure art!The Joker is such a complicated character and every actor in the years portrait im differently which always will be great.Joaquin Phoenix is beast in this role! I'll not compare his portrait of the character till I see the movie second time, but man...such a great performance!The whole dark Gotham vibe is so good, you can dive in it. There is pure acting and pure violence. Some people will like it, some not.This is not Jared Leto surrounded by 1,000 knives without reason...this is the real world.The movie perfectly show our society nowadays and maybe this is one of the reason why is so good.De Niro performance it's great as you can expect, same goes to all other supporting actors.The music kills at some points, because it's so intense with the particular scenes.So ground based and so good. This is probably the best movie this year after \"Endgame\", honestly...you can't compare them, they're both unique in their ways.I recommend this movie so much, but is not for everyone for sure. It'll make you think about so much things in the end because as I said....We are all clowns...of our time!",

Who knows if Oscar lover's will even know the higher level of what they are looking at.

Where were they all?! I thought this was supposed to be part of Zaddy Snyder's DC Universe. This was supposed to be connected to Snyder's masterpiece Justice League. Jared Leto's Joker was supposed to be Arthur Fleck's authustic son. There was none of it in it. This is just Taxi Driver but with Joker. Remove Joker from it and the movie still would've worked okay. Disappointed because I was expecting a lot of DC characters to appear especially Henry Cavill's Superman with his mustache :(",

But the Dark Knight nods are the ones that really get the excitement up whilst avoiding any cheesy CGI and glad to see no sequal or spinoff platform was built in to the story.Truly a masterpiece.... that maybe you should only see once....",

Never ever listen to the critics they are a bunch of sold ********.\nThere wasn't a single thing that could be controversial. Just pure Oscar winning performance by a great actor. And if some incel gets triggered from this then its his evil brain that need to be shot.\nFor me, Heath ledger was an unpredictable clown with no emotions.\nJoaquin phoenix is a clown that blasted from pain into a monster.Some people will tell that (just to look cool) heath ledger was the legend and Joaquin Phoenix was good but not heath ledger level even after watching this masterpiece, but deep down they know that Joaquin phoenix surpassed Heath and achieved a god level(which is obviously many levels ahead of \"legend\").And that laugh, dear god that is just terrifying. you can tell by that laugh that the guy is in some serious emotional trauma.\ncritics was being like that this movie is so violent and disturbing and blah and blah blah. you can count homicides in this movie on your fingers.\nJoker kills three sexual harassers, one backstabbing A-hole, one TV host(you should judge him after watching movie), his mother(which is not clear that either she is his biological mother or one who adopted him) and an Arkham asylum therapist(which is not shown graphically).\nMovie is very brilliantly made. Everyone did a great job and hats off to Joaquin who took his performance to god level. sure in distant future someone can achieve god level performance but cannot surpass it.\nNever listen or read to any \"professional\" critic cause they are getting paid for it. So they can't be trusted. Go watch the movie and make your own honest opinion because \"you are paying for it, not getting paid for it\".",

A society which will ridicule the isolated for being isolated and laugh and call him/her a clown for not achieving anything. What follows when one man stands up against the hypocrisy and injustice is anarchy and as we all know joker is a symbol of chaos. The film definitely hits the right nerve in the audience who would notice the relevance of the themes and concerns put forth to our current period and it may affect the wrong person..but the film doesn't end with the creation of joker but the birth of Batman. Chaos is not left to be celebrated but to remind us why we need order. The film is poetic in every sense though it falls slightly under to call itself a masterpiece.\nJoaquin Phoenix is a Master of his craft and a spectacular sight to see. On par with Ledger.",

    "reviewBody": "Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Joker Begins",
    "reviewBody": "An anarchist, his falling apart life and a city on edge -- what else you need to make a gritty, dark and violent biography of one of the greatest villain of cinematic history.Todd Phillip's Joker ticks all the box when it comes to making an edgy and dark film like this. Splashing blood, outrageous deaths and a world which is crumbling apart. This film has everything. But the soul of this film is Joker himself. This rendition of Joker, very skillfully takes inspiration from all the past presentations and yet able to put a breath of fresh air on this legendary character.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is not just breathtaking but strangely satisfying. Playing Joker on screen is perhaps one of the toughest jobs an actor can have. People have high hopes. And after Ledger's performance, Phoenix had a big shoe to fill in. But he shines in this film. The ease with which Phoenix carries out the role, speaks volume about his acting callibre.About the other aspects of the film, the cinematography is on point. It very craftily captures the city from Joker's eyes. It shows his struggle and his making. The audience was very much used to watching Gotham from Batman's eyes, but perhaps for the first time, we as an audience has access to the other side of the narrative.Speaking of the other side, this film very successfully shows the class struggle we humans have to endure. Moreover it shows the cycle of hate and crime, which effects the Gotham City and also eventually the life of our own Bruce Wayne.This film is a must watch. Although it might not be the best DC film ever to come, but it certainly is a living tribute to probably the greatest and most nuanced character humans have ever created.",

This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC.",

    "reviewBody": "Joker is an original movie about the iconic Batman villain of the same name, exploring his origins. It tells the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), a man who feels rejected by society.Joker is a mind-blowing film. Director Todd Phillips has given us a one of a kind comic book movie, that delves deep into the psyche of its titular character. What we get is a riveting film with twists & turns, that will leave you guessing, right till the end. Joaquin Phoenix is the star of the show, as Arthur Fleck. Phoenix completely immerses himself in the role & gives us another unforgettable performance. He deserves all the praise, accolades & Oscar buzz coming his way. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker, matches up to Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker, in The Dark Knight(2008). He also gives us a perfectly chilling 'Joker laugh'. Robert De Niro is awesome as Murray Franklin. Zazie Beetz is spectacular as Sophie Dumond. Frances Conroy is outstanding as Penny Fleck. Brett Cullen is amazing as Thomas Wayne. Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler & Leigh Gill are superb as Detective Burke, Detective Garrity, Randall & Gary, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Joker is a must watch for all the fans of one of the best comic book villains of all time. Go for it, as soon as possible!",

    "reviewTitle": "Beautiful take on the villain",
    "reviewBody": "To be honest I was not a fan of this solo Joker movie because I knew that if it were to be a success then people will start relating the Joker to Arthur Fleck.In my opinion the Clown Prince of Crime should not get a proper back story. That uncertainty behind his past is one of the things that makes this character so interesting.But whatever they have done here in this movie is amazing. The reason for Joker's grudge against the bat was something that we have all wondered about. They have explained the reasons here beautifully. The theater response was pretty positive during that reveal. So bat fans need not worry.Joaquin Phoenix begins as a semi lunatic and initially I did not very much like the character. However by the end he becomes a full blown psycho and the acting goes up by some notches once he puts the Joker make up on. The final 30 minutes are a must watch.Orchestra deserves special mention. Spine chilling music at crucial moments.Overall it's a dark toned film where we see someone who despises the society (especially bcoz of what it does to him) and loses his 'life' and mind in the process. It's also interesting that the film reminded me about Taxi Driver which is one of my favorite films. Robert De Niro who nailed that role plays a pretty decent part in this film too.Verdict: Slightly sadistic but beautifully crafted movie. Oscar contender for sure.",

    "reviewTitle": "Phoenix knocks it out of the park! [+78%]",
    "reviewBody": "What happens when the guy who made The Hangover series decides to cast an Oscar-nominated actor to play one of the most iconic comic-book villains of all-time? You just might not have expected something as dark and zany as 'Joker' to be the outcome. Here's an R-rated (supposedly) supervillain origin movie that screams DCEU but holds its own when it comes to storytelling and character development.Joker is led by an explosive performance from its leading man Joaquin Phoenix. While no comparisons need be made to the versions of the character brought to life by Ledger or Nicholson, Phoenix, without a doubt, has clearly taken the character to even greater (and more notorious) heights. The first hour of Joker is an intense slow-burn. Arthur Fleck is a struggling clown-for-rent-turned-aspiring-standup-comedian who is often rag-dolled around by twerps (for being physically weak) and despised by (rich) commoners for his unusual demeanour characterized by unwarranted stretches of laughter.The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver takes its own sweet time to showcase Arthur's gradual breakdown and eventual embracement of anarchy. The only bits of comforting normalcy are (apparently) offered by his mother, his next-door neighbor, and a talk-show host on TV. However, there's more to each of these characters than what meets the eye. The disturbing themes and elements in Joker indeed require a separate study of their own. That being said, the reasons attributed to Arthur crumbling under societal pressures are well-fleshed out and coupled with a haunting score by Hildur Guðnadóttir, ravishing cinematography by Lawrence Sher, and the vintage Scorcese-like sets, the psychotic transformation (into Joker) is cent per cent believable.Phoenix owns every scene that he's in, demanding your attention right from the opening scene where he pulls his mouth apart to form a fake smile. If the sole purpose of this character study, as the actor remarked in one of his interviews, was to shed light on (in addition to lending some credibility to) the uneasy life of Joker before he turned into the vicious version that Nolan gifted us a decade and a half ago, the film is a pertinent win. It is Gotham city (before Batman) indeed, and what's Gotham without the Wayne family? The Waynes' presence in the film will also surprise you in more ways than one.What stood out to me were two (brilliantly written & directed) scenes: the first taking place in a moving subway where Arthur encounters three 'rich pricks' that sets the ball rolling for his 'transformation' and the second, during the climax stretch when all hell breaks loose in Gotham and a broken-down Arthur goes about his unruly antics amid a riotous mob. I felt the film did not require the 'extended climax' either, because the scene right before subtly told the viewer that the transformation was complete.But when you look at the version of Gotham that Nolan built up versus the one Phillips does, one feels that the cynicism and hostility of its residents have been intentionally amped up for greater cinematic effect. Barely anyone in Phillips' Gotham (except for a handful) seemed cheery or comforting. Probably, that's what the makers were going for. Ignore the indistinct political commentary and you have a disturbingly dark piece of cinema in your hands! No heroes-in-capes are coming to your rescue here!",

But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thought-Provoking Masterpiece!",
    "reviewBody": "Joker is a drama movie in the vein of movies like Taxi-Driver and King of Comedy, It is a horror movie without any jump-scares or any other horror movie tropes and it is a comic-book origin movie about the most notorious and iconic villain. This movie will make you uncomfortable very often but ultimately it will force upon you some difficult questions that most movies shy away from asking. This is one of the few comic-book movies which will force you to think for hours after you have seen it.Joker is a movie about Arthur Fleck (played brilliantly by \"Joaquin Phoneix\") who had some psychopathic tendencies but due to deteriorating conditions of Gotham and certain events that took place in the span of the movie leads him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as Joker. The movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on Arthur Fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. The main credit goes to Joaquin Phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely Oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. The rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially Robert De Niro.The movie is directed by Todd Philips who before this had only directed movies like Hangover and Due date. This movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big Scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by Taxi Driver. Like Taxi Driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. As the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.The cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating Gotham and characters. The soundtrack of the movie was also very good again I think it was very similar to Taxi Driver, It wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.I am really glad that a movie like this exists. When comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. Projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. You may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. Having said that I really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take.",

    "reviewTitle": "Ledger was a sane man acting crazy, Phoenix is properly insane...",
    "reviewBody": "Smile and put on a happy face! This is what we are told when something bad happens or when we are having negative thoughts. But what if everything that happens is bad and all the thoughts are negative? In a city where every layer of society is bad in one way or another whether it is the poor, the rich or even the children, Arthur's sole dream was to make people laugh. Unfortunately, no one was laughing except him and his laughter was filled with pain...Pain that has been building up over the years and now Gotham is about to feel it.While Heath Ledger was a sane man acting crazy, Joaquin Phoenix is properly insane in his behavior and actions with The Joker simply being a tool that he used to justify his madness and make people notice him. He is not a comic book villain who wants to a be menace for a hero or achieve some aspiring goal of wickedness. In this movie, there are no heroes, there is no good...only the bad and the ugly. Arthur has no ambitions or reason and this is what makes him different and turns him into a movement that will erupt in an inferno changing Gotham forever.Joker is not a blockbuster movie. It is a hyperbolized portrayal of our society in which fear acts as fuel for hypocrisy, bigotry and jealousy that occupy people's minds. Fear of being oppressed by the rich. Fear of the poor taking over. Fear of one madman becoming a symbol of a rebellion that might have a catastrophic aftermath making things worse than they are. Joker will create plenty of noise and discussion with people arguing whether it is a masterful depiction of societal issues, a meaningless joke or maybe something in between. One thing is certain, comic book villains will not be the same.From the opening scene until the chillingly memorable ending, the film is a work of art in every aspect whether it is cinematography, music or acting. Joaquin squeezed everything out of himself to bring the madness on screen that made us feel sympathy towards Arthur and his struggle; in reality though, he didn't really care for it.P.S. I would recommend not to look at any ratings and not to view it as \"movie of the year\". Experience it in your own way and draw your personal conclusions.#moviesshmovie on instagram",

    "reviewTitle": "MASTERPIECE",
    "reviewBody": "#FinalVerdictJoker movie is a thunderous masterpiece! Can easily compete with the best comic book films of all time. The best movie of 2019 which belongs more in the Joaquin Phoenix Universe than the DC Universe.In the media, director Todd Phillips's Joker movie has been frenetically celebrated and a possible Oscars 2020 blessing (otherwise unthinkable for a comic-based film) is speculated violently. Let me say it loud and clear: there is not a word of it exaggerated.Joker movie is an \"origin story\", which tells how poor Arthur, nicknamed Happy by his mother, will become one of the most famous enemies of Batman. However, here there is no question of the Dark Knight, the story unfolds when Bruce Wayne is still a child.Surprisingly, Joker movie is totally a drama. A hard drama, rough, bitter, in a sticky environment. An environment that does not help Arthur to adapt. Director/writer Todd Phillips & cowriter Scott Silver take time to present the characters, places and situations.Joker movie is a work closer to auteur cinema. It's important to note that there's nothing wrong with this movie. Director Todd Phillips manages to infuse a very stylized colorful theme with the dark at the same time. It's bold, devastating & utterly beautiful.The sombre staging tackles you from the first second, shaking you through for two hours and never letting go until the last second. Joker movie is a horror story, not the celebratory tale of an antihero. Joker is a game changer and plays in a league of his own.The great soundtrack consists mainly of classics of the swing era (Frank Sinatra et al) and is an integral part of the plot. The congenial score of Hildur Gudnadottir amplifies the power of the images many times, so that every scene penetrates deep into the bone marrow.Director Todd Phillips is a revelation at the helm and does the best directing job of his career with the twisted material, able to strike a tone that straddles stabs of bleak darkness, gasps of hope and pangs of inevitability. I doff my hat to you sir!DOP Lawrence Sher's no-frills work to emphasize twisted, dark cityscapes, streets & nightmarish forms deserves a huge shout-out. With picture-perfect contrasts & color, sublime compositions, the rich and complex mise-en-scène succeeds in elevating the movie.But all of this impressive, stylish construction wouldn't have worked without Joaquin Phoenix. He inhabits his role with a commitment that's magnetic in its unpredictability. His unbelievable performance will leave the most lasting impression on the audience. Robert De Niro - one of his best roles for a long time! Zazie Beetz is remarkable.I left the cinema with lasting impressions & my mouth open. Beneath this gripping, bold, revisionist psychological thriller, Joker is the comic book villain we deserve right now.Joker movie is a masterpiece! Its understanding doesn't cross the line into sympathy, as we're left watching a man who becomes less & less human as his tragedy unfolds. We repeatedly see him burst into laughter, but can never rule out whether he's actually crying.",

This movie is the perfect answer to the question why joker was the joker you saw on the dark Knight saga. I never another director could pull it off but they did.\nIn the beginning you get a feeling that the directors relies heavily on the actors ability to act, but as the movie progresses you find that the direction actually complements the acting skills. The subtle detailing in almost all the scenes is yet another positive of the movie. The first few minutes of the movie tries hard to get your attention, but when it succeeds to grab your attention you will be on the edge of your seat. Its definitely a masterpiece.\nThe direction and screenplay competes with one another. Both exceeds your expectations.\nThe cast is another plus. Actor has done wonders.\nThe story perfectly connects the dark Knight saga. It even makes you want to see the dark Knight again. A special psychological drama that gives you almost everything that you expect from it.\nOverall its a masterpiece",

    "reviewBody": "Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from everyone. This movie basically shows the 1980s' America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous act took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on the brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of today's world, where everyone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others' condition or show empathy. The plot of the movie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs movements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the ending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is totally worth watching. Don't want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content.",

Through him, we see the dark, the oppressed, ones that never stood a chance whether in Dark Knight, we saw the bright side of the road. Joker isn't the vigilante, he is the part of the society that was never given a luck. He is the part of us where we leave in the dark and in the dark moments, he wakes up. Hysterical isn't it? He isn't the villian but not the hero as well.\nJoaquin Phoenix never disappointed me with his performances though he cannot compete with Ledger. Shots were superb, but the movie lacked the conversations. Joker in this movie, doesn't talk as much as he talked in Dark Knight.\nBut all in all, movie underlies the important issues of the society and gives us a clear look on what we're missing. It's filled with smart details and deep meanings. Bravo!!!",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is as good as dark knight for me. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't bag the Oscars, then I shall reach to the conclusion that academy doesn't care about talent. This was an emotional ride. You can understand why joker is, what he is. And where Ledger's Joker was a trickster cum terrorist type, this one is pure evil, dark and heavily mentally disturbed. I won't say he surpasses Ledger, but I also won't say that Ledger dominates, best is to say that both are equally fantastic. This has a very different tone. It solely relies on Phoenix's performance, without phoenix there won't be the magic in the movie. Also another thing was the story is fully focused on Joker, nothing else. This is more of a character study movie. Also the story and the way it's shot looks very much like a comic book. Overall, god bless Todd Philips and DC and Warner Bros and of course Phoenix for this",

    "reviewTitle": "Taxidriver 2",
    "reviewBody": "Here's my review of Joker , or Taxidriver 2 if I'm being honest . So \" Joker \" is directed by Todd Philips , who's best known for directing the hangover trilogy , due date and war dogs. I thought he was an oddball choice when it was first announced but I get why . The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck , a guy who is constantly tormented by society , and he was great ! .... As Arthur Fleck , but as the joker ? Well that's for you to decide . For me personally I thought he was good , definitely better than Leto's , but in b/w Ledger and Nicholson. The character of joker has has had many origins over his comic book and media appearances . From ' Gotham's ' Jerome valeska ' to Jack Napier , to the mobster from mask of the Phantasm. But the most popular ones are him falling into a pit of acid and the other one about him being a failed stand up comedian which then leads to the acid fall according to ' The killing Joke' by Alan Moore. This movie takes the failed stand up comedian thing from that , drops the acid thing and then sets up it's story , Which I thought was a really nod cause Joker's mainstream origin is now as familiar as Batman's origin. They also set up Batman's origin indirectly to the Joker's which I thought was personally brilliant . This movie justifies Joker's maniacal forced laugh as a medical condition and at one point brings in the question of whether it's legit or if he's faking it . Unlike other iterations the joker is more sane than other people , like from this scene at a comedy club where he's the only guy laughing at the good jokes and everyone else is laughing at the inappropriate ones , so he writes that fact down. This movie borrows a lot of themes from fight club such as the whole \" only when you lose everything are you free to do anything \" and many more. It's also very similar to Nightcrawler in terms of being an underdog story and in making us root for the underdog even though he's a cold blooded merciless. Which is funny because Nightcrawler was a modern take on Taxidriver and this movie is like 80% Taxidriver with the whole experimenting with your gun without a shirt on , the one liners , the philosophical talks , the gun on your temple gesture and lots more . The movie even has frickin Robert De Niro as a late night show host if you want more proof , which is ironic since De Niro plays a failed comedian who gets insulted by a show host in ' the king of comedy ' directed by scorcesse who also directed Taxidriver . God ! My head hurts. Yeah , so I did some googling and it turns out scorcesse helped out with the script . So it all makes sense now . I also liked how Joaquin Phoenix was able to go back and forth between his actual laugh and his medical condition laugh which is similar yet you can spot the difference from how the latter is soulless. That's some brilliant stuff there. I also liked how Phoenix was able make us hope he doesn't get beat up by people in a public train to hoping he doesn't kill that guy. The only gripes I had with this movie was that the soundtrack wasn't powerful enough when it needed to be and that in the third act in a TV studio set , Phoenix was overdoing it. In the end ' Joker ' isn't the best origin for the character , it's a movie which uses the characters label to gain hype for a Taxidriver spinoff which is amazing ! All that stuff I said about the movie being close to Taxidriver is not a critique. Because this movie is brilliant . So it's a great attempt to dive into the psyche of an anarchist and make you wonder .... Chaos is just order yet undeciphered.",

    "reviewTitle": "OK, but not as epic as expected",
    "reviewBody": "Not sure if it's a good idea to write a review here, as it seems, that Fanboys are rating down carefully considered reviews, just because they are not praising endgame, but so be it.I was not really disappointed, but I was also not stunned by this movie. It had a lot of shortcomings, logic-flaws and humor that simply wasn't funny or jokes that were somehow not fitting into the storyline. Some characters developed in a direction, I personally did not like and the overall ending to the movie seemed rushed and somehow chaotic.Overall it was a decent ending to this MCU phase, but as always, it's down to personal preference if you like a movie or not or if you wished for a different storyline.There are too many things, that were illogical:\nNebula not telling the guys what it takes to get the soul stoneTony Stark not even questioning why Pepper is in the end-fight and not taking care of their childrenDepressed, fat ThorCaptain America being able to use Thor's hammerCaptain America living a life with his girlfriend without someone remembering it in their timelineAll of a sudden, all dead heros appear out of nowhere - all coming from Wakanda - how the heck did they know and gather in the first place?If you haven't seen Captain Marvels end credit-scene, Captain Marvel would appear right out of nowhere in this movie and everyone would wonder why.Thor being depressed and fat and this Softie-Version of Hulk were the main character developments I also did not like.Personally didn't like Tony Stark being killed, but one saw that coming. After all, his story was told. Captain America living another live at least got him a happy end, although and illogical one. The hairstyle of captain Marvel ... ok, let's not talk about this one.There are certain scenes that are indeed epic, overall, the movie was entertaining, but I honestly liked Infinity War more.Cannot tie this to specfic reasons, it's a combination of all the aforementioned elements, that simply didn't do the trick for me to make it an epic movie.Considering myself being a big fan of the MCU franchise, I think all fans should see it, but if you are at least somehow interested in a decent and logic storyline, be warned you might not be too overwhelmed by this movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Trying to wrap too many stories and not doing it well",
    "reviewBody": "It's way too long. There's way too little fun or humor. Since it's yet-another-time-travel movie, it's not very interesting. Though they try to take a new spin on it (explicitly stating that \"it doesn't work like in Back to the Future\"), they end up with the same usual time-travel-silliness. The whole \"multiverse and multi-timelines\" is thus pretty inconsistent and weird. Sure, this is a comic-book movie, things don't make sense, but, still, they should at least be somewhat consistent.We never quite get why this chain of events is the only one out of 5 million that works and why had Dr Strange chosen it.And the whole \"can't undo real deaths, only the Thanos-induced kind-of-deaths\" is not explained (sure, it probably would not make sense anyway, but, still, it's kind of important and they don't even try).Thanos goes full-blown villain, which is not in line with his character.It also doesn't wrap up the story for all of the original Avengers. You kind of get why are the ones that are still here the \"chosen ones\" (clue: this is a business), but, still, it's a \"conclusion of a story that is actually _not_ a conclusion of the whole story\".Even for the ones that are done, their conclusions are not well done, are somewhat cliched, predictable and un-interesting. Iron-Man fairs best here, but, still underwhelming.On the plus side, from a general movie quality, this is better than Infinity War, it's better connected and the pace is better. Taking time-travel-silly aside, the story is OK. Although there a few \"feminism in your face\" moments, it doesn't go overboard.Acting is good enough, but, it could have been better. Some things didn't work, like Hemsworth's take on fat Thor, others were just not very good (ScarJo as the \"no-nonsense leader of the free-decimated-universe\" and Chris Evans' take on Charlie Sheen - like Anger Manager) while the rest were just OK - foremost RDJ. But, the thing is, we've seen these actors do better, it's bad they couldn't do it again.Bottom line, as a kind-of wrap-up for some characters, it's OK, worth a watch. But, on its own or if you're not into the characters that were \"wrapped up\", it's not.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thanks to endgame, random fat guys with beer bellies can be Thor at comic con and it'll be okay...",
    "reviewBody": "First, I am a HUGE Infinity Wars fan.. I even collected expansive statues re-enacting the epic battle in my shelves (after winning infinity style war with my wife of course).As predicted, the Director made the end sappy enough for some to shed tears. I was shedding tears myself on the account I would never make the insane amount of money the actors (main casts) did. The first two hour was a total drag, it was as if the Director owes 3 hours to the audience or maybe in a more sinister manner they believe epic movie should run at least 3 hours (Hence... 3 hours 1 minute including credits).My major concern was the TIME TRAVELING plot which disregarded paradoxical continuity. Again, I am not a hater. I just found it highly inefficient if not plain stupid to have the remaining Avengers to go back in different TIMEs and PLACEs to collect each individual stone (the SOUL stone requires SACRIFICE!... duh). Would it be easier if they just went BACK in TIME (along with Captain Marvel this time) to the planet where Iron Man & friends battled Thanos and stripped him off the gauntlet which was already full of stones? If they did this, there wouldn't be any needs of casualty. Vision would be spared. Scarlet witch wouldn't need to be as traumatic then.Well, TIME HEIST damage has been done, but AGAIN:\n1. Why didn't the future Nebula died instantly when she killed her PAST self? Violation for the Grandpa Paradox. Or, as it turned out, JC wasn't the only one to get resurrected afterall.2. Why on earth did Iron Man have to conjure the gauntlet onto himself while risking DEATH? Why can't he instead put the gauntlet on Captain Marvel or HULK (who did it once and survived) or Thor and let them SNAP the hell of it? They were sorta IMMORTALS member of the Avengers with strength that most likely will withstand the impact anyway. But no, Stark had to get the end credit.3. What made the snapping of the Gauntlet by the Hero result in different way from Tanos? What if when Iron Man flicked it, the result was also the annihilation of half the population? Too risky a think. I liked War Machine's idea of going back in time and strangled baby Thanos instead.4. Finally, LOKI should've been brought to LIFE as the TIME TRAVELling thing would cancel out the event in which LOKI was killed by Thanos. I felt like this was an anticlimax to the flawless Infinity Wars... sorry Stan. If you want a better time traveling movie, go see \"Back to the future\" or even \"Hot-tub time machine\".. and \"Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure\"",

Let me tell you why.\nThe movie's lengh is overextended with too many scenes taking more time than they deserve.\nThe fight/ war scenes should have been more than this giving that this is the finale.\nThe final battle were done under poor lighting and i expected much more visual effects, the last movie final battle were conducted in so many better ways. The detailing of the battle became so pathetic with people chasing a start's arm with the stones on them.\nThe final battle's logic which allowed stark to finish everything is really unexplained, a man who posses the power of a god can't save his own life after wanting so much to be there for his daughter.\nThe concept and the handling of fhe time travel was poorly excuted.\nThe way captain america appeared in the final scene and the explanation of how he did so is childish.\nThe hulk role was so much dominished.\nFury had nothing to do with this film, just an appearance in the final scene.\nCaptain marvel's presence is truly sarcasitc, she appears at weird times and the justification fot this is funny.\nThor became a comic role in this movie, no what so ever strength in his character not even in the final scenes.\nDr strange role was dimished also, he is supposed to be one of the best avengers.\nAgain the final battle really failed to impress me, which is one of the main reseaons for disappointments.\nThe emotional scenes in the movie were scattered and undefined, this is sad giving the fact that the movie had all the elements required to deliver great emotional scenes where you can see each character's emotioned in a much clearer display.\nI expected an epic film, a solid plot and a flying emotions, this movie didn't deliver any of those to me.",

It did a somewhat satisfactory job of bringing together all of the previous MCU movies...certainly no easy task. However, there was very little action, most of the jokes fell flat, and the emotional scenes didn't reverberate. Also, there were just too many obvious plot holes, both within the whole time-travel theme and in general. It just wasn't a great story or a great job of storytelling. I'll admit that I'm not an emotional person, but anyone who said they cried (especially some of the critics who said they cried, cried, laughed, cried, cheered, and cried some more) has never seen an actual well-made movie with a great story. I didn't cry at the end of Infinity War, and I certainly didn't get even the slightest bit emotional in Endgame. I also saw critics who said everyone stood and cheered when it was over. I definitely didn't experience that. Our theater just sat pretty quietly with quite a few conversations about the gaping plot holes. Again, not a bad movie, but it certainly didn't live up to what I was hoping for.",

    "reviewTitle": "A breathtaking Homeric battle",
    "reviewBody": "This is probably one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the moment, with Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The previous opus of the Avengers series, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), had left 'us' high and dry, in the depths of the abyss, while the latest episode of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel (2019), gave 'us' back a glimmer of hope.In short, I saw it in Paris this morning and I enjoyed it. It's an efficient blockbuster. The script and the manifold plot twists permanently keep the audience spellbound and breathless. This movie is one of the funniest and one of the most spectacular of the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe saga, not to mention an astonishing Computer-Generated Imagery, despite manifold script weaknesses that I will partially reveal below, within a dedicated post-script.Otherwise, a very unusual observation, at least within Paris: the audience has repeatedly applauded, at least 7/8 times, including the very beginning and the end of the movie, conveying an uncontrollable impatience, like a collective catharsis boosted to the extreme. And a female teen, about 17/18 years old, not far from me, cried. Literally! The audience was obviously made up of fans conquered beforehand... and that was part of the show!So Marvel, what's next? I am probably addicted and certainly impatient!As a post-script, a few remarks, annoyances or even irritations:1) First, a tiny spoiler as a favor. You will get absolutely nothing at the very end. Contrary to the Marvel habits and customs, there is no post-credit scene.2) The first half-hour is an immeasurable disappointment. While Thanos had, in the first opus, undertaken a Herculean task, a titanic challenge, a Homeric Odyssey in order to gather the 6 infinity stones and \"bring balance to the universe\" as a demiurge, in the second opus, he contents himself with a miserable and lonely life such as a peasant from the Middle Ages, because \"the stones served no purpose beyond temptation\". Wooooow! Literally incredible.3) Who understood this quote from Tony Stark to Steve Rogers? \"It's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might have wound up pushing time through Lang\". Honestly, I do not know if we need an IQ above 250 or below 60 to understand this quote...4) During the manifold fights versus the Avengers, we do not really see the difference between Thanos with the 6 infinity stones and Thanos without: his power seems unchanged!5) Time travel exists fundamentally in two versions: a change in the past will or will not have an impact in the future. Even if the first category is the most representative with classics such as The Terminator (1984) or Back to the Future (1985), Avengers: Endgame (2019) clearly belongs to the second category.6) For their time heist, the Avengers break down into 3 separate teams to join 3 distinct time-spaces in which there are 3 Thanos. One Thanos in each space-time: New-York in 2012, Asgard in 2013, Morag+Vormir in 2014. During 60 minutes, we follow these 3 concomitant stories. The Thanos from 2014 discovers and understands the whole intrigue thanks to his daughter Nebula. Nevertheless, the Avengers are able to switch from one space-time to another one, thanks to a protective suit, a GPS bracelet and a capsule containing Pym particles. Thus, these three elements are specially designed by Tony Stark, with the posthumous help of Hank Pym, for such an expedition and are a priori mandatory for the way in and the way back. But we do not really know how, the Thanos from 2014 will go back in time with his faithful right-hand man Ebony Maw, the whole armada and a huge spaceship. Wooooow! Even alone, this time-travel should be impossible.7) For the time heist in Vormir, why Natacha Romanoff and Clint Barton have to go first through Morag, with James Rhodes and Nebula? The Avengers could have splitted the whole team in 4 instead of 3 from the start, right? So, why 3 teams instead of 4? Knowing that I see no reason for this detour via Morag, I think that the scriptwriters were desperately stuck and were looking for a way for the Thanos of 2014 to recover a free fast-pass, i.e. a protective suit + a GPS bracelet + a Pym capsule. Those of the mortal remains of Natacha Romanoff. Except that the Thanos of 2014 was absolutely not aware of the presence of this corpse on Vormir. In any way!8) The scriptwriters have combined two ultra-complex concepts, i.e. time travel and quantum realm, in order to optimally cheat the audience. Indeed, when Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are back in New-York, they are magically able to time-travel from New-York in 2012 to Camp Lehigh in 1970 without the help of any quantum tunnel device...9) .... and so on ... and so on ... The screenwriters had obviously bigger eyes than belly! In short, this is a typical pop corn movie: turn your brain off, and then, and then only, enjoy the show!10) At last, a two-penny question: where did they find inspiration for the hairstyles? A moronic soccer player for Clint Barton, undoubtedly. Without forgetting Carol Danvers, or how to disfigure a sex bomb with a pair of scissors?That's all, folks!",

Not to mention that they totally destroyed the idea of the hulk once they made him wear freakin glasses and turn him into a smart ass funny character.. last movie doesnt have to be the best...

    "reviewTitle": "It's still Iron Man's world and the rest of the Avengers are still just living in it...",
    "reviewBody": "Well...most of them.The film opens on Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye with his happy family...until he no longer has one on account of them being dusted, which causes him to become vengeful Mohawkeye. Next up it's my least favourite Avenger, Tony Snark, teaching games to Nebula (my favourite Guardian of the Galaxy and the only one of those a-holes I actually LIKE. Mantis, who I also like and who *isn't* an a-hole, sadly only gets one line in the movie, but at least it's a funny one). The term drawn-out could be used to describe this whole opening with Tony. 'Self-indulgent' would be another. Just because you have a 3-hour+ runtime, Russos, doesn't mean you should waste it lingering on Tony sleeping, etc. I did appreciate, though, that Nebula shows she's grown (as evidenced by the fact she's refrained from beating the snot out of Tony the entire time they've been stuck in space together). I was happy to see her featured so much.Thankfully things finally get moving once Captain Marvel saves their butts and interacts with the team in a scene most have probably watched already. As she points out to Rhodey Rude (whose main role seems to be Joke/Movie Reference Man), she's been on other planets after 'The Snap' that *didn't* have The Avengers to help them out. The fact that THOR says he likes her should be enough (though obviously won't be for certain people). He also learns from the mistake he made at the end of Infinity War regarding what bodypart to aim for on Thanos (who apparently wiped out half the universe's populace so he could become a farmer and unfortunately destroyed the Infinity Stones). Too bad Nebula's robbed of the chance to end Thanos in this movie (twice!), as she probably deserved to the most. Tony the Drama Queen proves he hasn't grown at all, laying the blame for everything at Cap's feet.A skip to five years later reveals time hasn't been kind to Thor. I'm saddened to see him reduced to this joke, when the first Thor movie is one of my favourites. They've veered too far into 'comedy' for my taste, as here he's played mostly for laughs on account of letting himself go (for those wanting shirtless Thor, you'll get him...though you'll wish you *hadn't*). Bless Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, as he brings a breath of fresh air to proceedings. His reunion with his (now grown) daughter is one of the few genuinely effective emotional moments in the film. Unfortunately, he's not given the respect he deserves, considering he's the one to come up with the idea of time travel (the subject of which is given the ultimate nerd discussion in this film). They go to Tony, who selfishly refuses to help the others get back everyone they lost since he already HAS everyone HE wants (well...except for Spider-Kid, who is the reason he eventually changes his mind).Cut to after a 'comedic' sequence involving working out the kinks of time-travelling, the gang splits up to retrieve all the stones from the past. This is where the film kicks into gear, as we revisit past MCU films and encounter previous versions of characters. Highlights include: Cap seeing Peggy Carter again, Cap vs Past Cap, Thor spending some precious time with his soon-to-be-deceased mother (plus, a Jane cameo! There's actually lots of cameos in the film, but only a few I cared about) and twice the amount of Nebula. There's one rage-inducing consequence of visiting the past involving Mohawkeye, Natasha and the Soul Stone. If you remember what happened with Gamora, you'll know what that means. Although the character who ends up being the sacrifice gets some good character/emotional beats in this film, it still doesn't make up for the fact they're unceremoniously given the 'permadeath' treatment, thus robbing us of one of the MCU's best characters and the awesome dynamics between them and other characters. Given all the others that could've been offed, WHY'd it have to be...well...you'll see.I'll give the film credit for seamlessly blending the 'present' characters with the past, and once things reach the climax, they definitely ensure this is the most 'epic' battle we've seen yet which involves pretty much every character (except those who're unfortunate enough to *stay* dead, of course), some of which will be getting future films or TV shows to appear in. I guess that's meant to 'make up for' them not getting much screentime here (like my fave, Wanda. At least she gets some revenge on Thanos and shares an emotional moment with Mohawkeye near the end. I'm looking forward to her show and hopefully future movie appearances too). Captain America gets at least two cheer-worthy moments, while Captain Marvel and her new haircut get to kick some major arse (don't fret, haters...she isn't given the final victory over Thanos. No, we all know who gets THAT privilege).I guess I was supposed to feel sad near the end, but honestly I just felt relief, as it's about time a certain someone faced some actual real consequences. Hopefully other characters will get to thrive/have substantial screentime now that somebody isn't hogging it all. Another good thing about the end is the camera shot which slowly moves through/covers everyone (all these characters we've come to know, plus a few we haven't yet) at the funeral. The BEST part, however, is the final scene. I've waited ever since the first Cap movie (my other fave MCU film) to get to the scene that ends this movie, and I think it's worth it. I'm so very happy with it and who it involves.While there're no mid-credits/post-credits scenes, it's worth sticking around to see the original six Avengers actors literally signing off. It'll probably take a couple of viewings to fully digest this film, as it throws in everything AND the kitchen sink. It's a fitting conclusion to Phase 3 (ignoring Spider-Kid 2). Now, bring on Phase 4!",

The first act of this movie should have been included in the infinity war. And that would make infinity war the perfect movie... Why? Just why are they doing it like this? Cut some unnecessary scene in the infinity war to get that 3 hour screen time and then end the film with Thanos head. We will face the shock of reality that even when they defeat the villain, its not enough. The world already changed. And then start the sequel, 5 year after, with that time travel plot. And rework the movie with a better story, or if you can, just give a brief explaination about the time travel plot so that it didnt resulting in a huge paradox like this. For movie goers the current plot is okayish but for scifi nerd this is unacceptable. The lost of one of the avenger is a pure tearjerk but the other one doesnt make any sense. It could have been done better with a different character.\nOverall it is okay for entertainment if you dont think too much about it. But I feel unsatisfied with what they are doing.

Would have expected him to beat the **** out of thanos and his troops, but he was pretty much useless in retrospective. Instead we have Captain Marvel that outshines the other characters powers by far, plus no one wants to see this because she is just flat and unappealing.I also expected more of Thanos, his sudden change of mind wasnt very relatable after the determined / balanced seeming Thanos weve seen in the previous movie.

But regretfully, there are others parts where this change of plans destroyed the movie for me.\nI don't know, turning Thor into an alcoholic, lazy dude who does nothing besides playing Fortnite (yes, Fortnite is in this movie) all day just isn't funny at all and ruins the hard work Taika Waititi has put into him. I also hate what they did to Hulk/Banner, I always thought Banner was an extremly likeable and interesting character, but in this movie I couldn't stand him.\nMost of the other characters are just _fine_, Tony and Steve being the only ones who really stand out. Endgame gives either of those characters important decisions to make and their dynamic is absolutely entertaining.\nSteve's ending though was just awful. Not only was it predictable ever since we knew time travel would be part of the plot, it wasn't satisfying at all. Steve leaving his two best friends behind, who he hadn't seen in f i v e years, just to hang with the girl he met for a few weeks eighty years ago AFTER he already made out with her niece is just unbearable. Awful. Why would you do that.I liked the ending they gave Tony, it was fitting for his character and regarding his importance for the whole MCU he deserved a big goodbye.\nTo be honest, I would've liked it more if they gave Steve the big, heroic death and let Tony live in retirement with his family but hey, whatever.So in conclusion, after first watching it I really expected more. This just wasn't the big ending I was promised, it was weird at times and overall fine at best. I don't think it was necessary to make it three hours long. The Russo Brothers directed all of my favourite MCU movies so far, but this one was a total miss.\nWouldn't recommend if you're not a fan.",

    "reviewTitle": "Disappointingly Mediocre",
    "reviewBody": "I want to begin by saying that had this been a standalone movie I would have probably given it a 4 or 5, but for this particular movie, the movie of the decade, the big conclusion everything was leading up to, mediocre-ness is worse than complete failure. We were promised a masterpiece and we received something that what so-so at best.\nI'll break down what I think went wrong, so spoilers ahead:\nThe biggest issue with this movie is the ever-paradoxical use of time travel. Unless you are making a silly comedy like \"Back to the Future\" it always messes with continuity and no matter how well you try to explain that the canon reality does not just collapse under the paradox, it is always going to feel like the lazy way out, and so it did in this one. Steve deciding to go rogue back to the 40s, thus ignoring all the character development he went through and irreparably messing with every timeline is not exactly the extremely satisfying closure we were promised in interviews with directors and actors. Overall I suppose the expectations were just so high that nothing could have lived up to it, but with the amounts of money and the access to great creators Marvel has I really would have expected something else- something as creative and mind-blowing as they promised instead of the honestly mediocre at best time-travel flick we got. Messing with timelines and essentially de-canonizing large chunks of the MCU just was not what I was hoping for.\nAnother thing I had a problem with is that this movie was supposed to perfectly conclude every character's arc so far. We were promised a suitable ending of some journeys and at least a crucial point in everyone else's. Instead, Black Widow was killed without ever even allowing her to develop a character. Thor, who could have been the ideal king of Asgard was turned into a fatphobic joke by equating his chubbiness with sloppiness (personally, I liked his new look. Thor looked rather like a man who is strong from physical labour than planned workouts and diet plans, but the way they dressed him in dirty clothes, made him lazy and greasy is just so terrible), while the lessons he learned in Ragnarok and the sacrifices he made did not seem to have any effect at all; the loyalty he felt to his people completely disappeared. Iron Man was ripped of his peaceful retirement, where for the first time he was allowed to try to heal, just because someone had to die dramatically.\nDon't misunderstand me, I am not bitter that they killed off beloved characters, in fact I understand that it had to happen, however I would have loved to see them take the characters' arcs into account. In my opinion, Steve should have died because he has no place in either the future or the past, and his mission is completed. Tony, on the other hand, should have lived because he finally made an effort to heal and overcome his trauma. I don't mean to suggest that one or another character should or should not have died, I only think I might have been able to accept the way things turned out if there was a reasonable plot leading up to it that made their death a logical conclusion. The Marvel movies are fictional and everyone who goes to watch them is very aware of the fact that there is a team of writers and creators who crafted everyone's arc and worked on it for a long time. I would have appreciated to watch the outcome reflect the amount of work and time I am sure many people put into this project.\nUltimately I have to admit that the messages we get to take away from this film are what really made me sad: People with trauma don't deserve to heal, people's actions and experiences have seemingly no consequences, and friendship and found family mean nothing against the ideal of a romantic relationship.This is a very long movie and so there are many more things I could address, for example the \"Hail Hydra\" scene, Steve wielding Mjolnir, how similar this movie was to the last one, Loki's unexplained disappearance in the past timeline, the cheap attempt of making up for the lack of lgbt heroes by showing a mlm extra in one scene, the list goes on. But all those things seem somehow related to the major issues I addressed earlier. Perhaps the hype was too big, perhaps the team did get lazy and rested on the success of the franchise or perhaps it is just me expecting too much from a superhero movie.\nRegardless, if you loved this movie, I see your point, it is in many ways what we were expecting, but what I was hoping for was something new, something revolutionary that would surprise and amaze me. Maybe in another ten or twenty years we will get that movie I thought this was going to be, but I am afraid that by then I will not be interested anymore.",

    "reviewBody": "The trailers to this film are completely misleading. It painted a bleak, inevitable outcome for the surviving heroes after Thanos's devastating snap that left the whole universe in ruins.It goes into a completely different direction than I originally expected. For one thing, it's much funnier than I thought.\nIt's also nothing like Infinity War. It's basically a mix of many other marvel movies all wrapped into one epic heist film.Its lengthy time run does get a bit problematic at times, but by the time the climactic battle sequence comes by the end, you forget all about it. Those who had been disappointed or despondent by Infinity War will rejoice when seeing this one.The film is a true testament to sacrifice, love and loss. Obviously I laughed, I cried and I clapped. This is truly cinematic history.",

    "reviewBody": "I've loved every single Marvel movie because they brought about this level of authenticity, humor, love, loss, failure, strength and a sense of unity to us fans. They weren't just movies, they were pure entertainment. Therefore, as much as it hurts me to say this, I was terribly disappointed with this movie.Don't get me wrong, there were moments which got me thinking, 'Ok this is it' , just to be disappointed again. It was terribly funny to Thor looking fat and drunk but he was pretty much useless through the entire movie. He didn't do anything other than sulk and cry. He didn't even use his hammer and it was Captain America that did half the work for him . The entire plot about quantum realm time travelling was so vague that I never understood what was happening. It felt like they thought about time travelling as a last ditch attempt to keep the story going. Hulk was the biggest disappointment of them all. He's supposed to be the strongest avenger, the mightiest and all that. Instead we get a version of \"Best of both worlds\" ??If I have to compare this to any other time travelling movies or shows, let's just say that this movie is the worst of them all. Except for when Tony and Natasha die, every other emotional scene felt forced and fake.With regards to Captain Marvel, they needn't have wasted their money and time with an introduction movie for her because she didn't do anything in this movie. Fine, she blasts through Thano's ship and gives everyone respite from the ceaseless bombings but her only other appearance is twice or thrice. And she's got a cool haircut..",

    "reviewBody": "Will probably get killed with dislikes, but hear me out before you come at me:To set things straight; yes this was a good action movie. Was it more than that? Not really. Let me explain why.1. The whole thing about fortnite, hulk-dabs and fatty-Thor was really .. unnecessary. I really love how Marvel use humor in their movies - but this is reaching.2. I love paying for long movies, but I hate checking my watch mid-playtime. It felt like some parts of the movie could've been clipped out to keep the flow going a little better.3. The last fight scene has been named by some as one of the best ever on screen. I have to disagree. The clash was both very messy and clumsy. It was hard to focus on what really happened, and it felt like they had to bring just everything without thinking about how it looked on screen. Personally I felt nothing special about it, and there were really never a point we're i wondered if our heroes would prevail...To sum my review up; Marvel has ended one of their best series, and they did it in a decent way. Sadly it feels like they are trying to please more children, especially when they force stuff like Fortnite and dabbing into the movie. I'm disappointed, but yet I had a good time.",

No action at all and it looks like a drama movie here. Really boring in fact.The second act is the time travelling thing, also no action in here but a lot of funny moments though. Everyone in the theatre was laughing multiple times.There's only action during the third act.. Great action scenes and surprises here. But sometimes it felt like it was a little bit rushed. Thanos is also extremely (unrealistically?) powerful without the gountlet. Not a lot of screenplay for the children of Thanos. I think they could have done more with the Maw for example.If you compare the action of infinity war to this one, it looks like there wasn't enough money left for it... Maybe most of the money went to ALL the actors within MCU for reappearing all again in this movie for a couple of minutes?",

The Russo Brothers absolutely lived up to the expectations and delivered the epic conclusion we were all waiting for. You can probably nitpick this movie if you want (as you can any movie), but to me that's pretty much what you have to do to find flaw with it. I think that the emotions throughout are played so well and we get those moments with each character where they feel human, especially with all 6 of our original avengers. Each has their moment to shine and I truly loved it. The humor was well-used, the story made sense, the finale was downright perfect, and it was an all-around great movie!SPOILERS\nMy favorite stuff\nThe beginning with Clint's family was downright heartbreaking to watch, and a great way to bring that human aspect to the story, seeing someone who had no idea what was going on be affected by the snapThe subversion of expectation meeting thanos and realizing he not only doesn't have the stones but he doesn't carePaul Rudd. What a guy.The second act plot is really done well, it makes sense yet the way they go about it with the callbacks to almost every movie through cameos or reliving scenes is great, especially in the New York scenes (specifically the elevator scene from winter soldier being called back)-Black Widow dying is another expectation subversion and is done very well\nTony having a moment with his dad is great to seeThe way by which thanos is reintroduced as the villain is actually brilliant and gives a new perspective to his motivations and the way he destroys the facility after the reversal snap is greatCap picking up Thor's hammer is all kinds of yupGiving our main three some alone time fighting thanos is a great way to give them their time to shineAvengers Assemble is everything I didn't know I needed.Tony's arc is done so well and how he sacrificed himself reminds me so deeply of the scene in Avengers when cap said tony wouldn't sacrifice himself for others.Cap getting to dance with PeggyThor joins the Guardians!My negative stuff (these didn't really bother me that much but a little bit)\nThe whole fat Thor thing kinda makes some of the dramatic moments later on kinda weaker in my opinionSame with half-hulk, almost felt hard to take him seriously at first but it made more sense as the story grewNot sure I can buy thanos changing his mind for his plan to cleanse the universe by destroying it and starting over, but I like that he's willing to die for his own causewould've liked more action especially in the first act but I appreciated the emotions",

And from then on, it's a post-disaster movie trying to address the previous movie's aftermath. All the while it becomes a Back to the Future-like adventure on steroids and it even has Terminator callbacks as well. And it's got the emotional gravitas of Toy Story 3. Oh: and Thor's chubby in this, and a MASSIVE troll online whenever Korg needs him to be (in ### ######). It's got taught writing with just as focused direction telling a story through the action as opposed to action taking over the story.SEE THIS MOVIE! It's as much movie a movie can get this year! And we've still got PLENTY of other goods on the horizon still.5/5 stars.",

    "reviewBody": "The premise of the quantum realm and time travel in MCU is, when you change the past, you're not changing the future. You made alternate realities. Like how nebula is killing her past self yet she didn't die with her. And how Thanos came to the future and lost means there's a reality where he never got any Infinity stones, coz if it's the same reality, Guardians of Galaxy wouldn't even be assemble.Now, how could Rogers change his past yet he could still be in the \"normal\" reality?",

    "reviewTitle": "Lazy writing",
    "reviewBody": "The visual effects are spot on, as usually.\nThe 6/10 ranking has to due with Captain America ending.He ended up with Peggy, meaning he did not grow at all. He was still stuck in the past and life is about dealing with new circumstances and understand some doors are closed forever. Not only that, Peggy's story as a brave independent woman who fought for a better world loses some meaning.\nIt is also hard to believe Steve Rogers would stay quiet during 70+ years whilst Peggy would do the hard work.\nSteve Rogers's ending is lazy, incoherent and cliche.Black Widow dies, sacrificing herself, meaning any solo movie with her is meaningless. Her death as some sense, but it still feels empty.Tony Stark also dies, after having a happy ending (at the beginning of the movie). I believe this death is going to be divisive.The loopholes with time travel are there (how does Peter resume his life with the same colleagues?) and are kinda disappointing the more you think about them.Marvel really went for the pockets of the consumers and didn't put in the effort to tide things up orderly.",

Every MCU fan should watch this film, but as I, a comic fan as well, won't enjoy it as much as one expects it, in my opinion.\nI grew up on these films and the crown of those films was unfortunately built merely on the last films for example Captain Marvel.\nI don't want to speak about what would be better I better just say what I liked and what I did not.\nI liked that the final battle was very comicish, and that this film explained a bunch of previous mysteries for instance how the Hydra got the scepter.\nI disliked that the jokes were too childish for me and that the time travel was too sloppy.\nI found a bit disrespectful what they did to Thor the god of thunder and I still don't understand why they boosted Captain America to be able to hold the Mjölnir and summon lightnings.\nAll in all I am a bit disappointed, I feel it is not worth my awaitings and I am a bit concerned what the future of our beloved characters will be.",

    "reviewTitle": "Is this a Film or an Epic?",
    "reviewBody": "I don't know if we ever could of imagined the state of Marvel comic-book movies 11 years after the first MCU film in 2008, to review this film as a movie a one of film, I don't think that would do it justice because as a single stand alone film (even though its a sequel) would not do it the proper justice , however this is the only way I know how to break down a film. I will judge the MCU as a whole in another review. If I was to sum this movie up as brief as possible its, Avengers end game is the fan service movie you didn't know you wanted, with a story and battles thrown in there to pad the run time.\nWhere the movie succeeds is in its grandeur and its design, it is extremely large scale, sometimes to its own detriment ( I looking at you final battle sequence ) but nevertheless you can feel the immensity of this epic, I will be breaking it down into several parts, Story, Cinematography, Actors/Actress , Characters, Motivations, Soundtrack, Pacing, Design, Re-watch ability & HeartStory\nwhen you have a story that expands over 20 plus movies to culminate into one it is a hard task, but this movie does succeed in the story it has clear goals, which they seem to accomplish, sometimes without any resistance what so ever, the scene where Tony stark, just happens to make time travel possible after stating it could never be done, was a little jarring & every obstacle that they did eventually encounter was immediately remedied, antmans a baby then turn the power off , couldn't get the correct stone, just go back again, there seemed to be obstacles placed in there way in order for the heroes to just step over them, rather then a climb or hurdle, personally I feel it would have been better to have as many if they were not as significant, the part I loved was in the first act where we see a 5 year jump and the world is still in mourning over the vanishing of half the population, the arc in which Hawk eye is introduced again was a satisfying one, the lead up to the inevitable gathering of all the heroes from earth and beyond was something expected in the final act but was done in a way that would even simmer the harshest of critics, the killing of Thanos in the first 10 minutes was a pleasant surprise, but without a clear antagonist until about 1 hour and 45 minute mark, the story progression took a back seat for character development, Storyline Score 7.5/10Cinematography\nThankfully unlike a lot of the other MCU this film sense of Enormity was done quite well with the cinematography, while the standardised shot, reverse shots were very predominant, there are a few glorious moments, mainly involving the quantum realm & the final battle sequence, the colour scenes and lighting are an improvement on Infinity war up until the final battle, but the cold colour pallet sets the mood for a very different MCU film in the beginning , Cinematography Score 6/10Actors/Actress\nTo me this is where the movie shines its brightest as there is a range we see from many actors, the desperation in the beginning on Chris Hemsworth's face & the slight lip quiver and slightly tearing eyes of Scar-Jo allowed us to see this is a passionate cast we are dealing with, the subtleties of almost every actor in this film reflect the minor changes they have from shot to shot, with a show don't tell style which is refreshing for the MCU. Stand-outs are RDJ, Chris Evens & Scarlet Johansen\nActor/actress score 8.5/10Characters\nEvery character in this film felt like they had a role to play, and there wasn't too much cross over between them, rocket raccoon was the snippy one, ant-man was the comic relief however Thor was a problem to say the least, the running gag of him being a fat hair drunk was played up way to much and in almost every scene he was in we are constantly reminded that he is drunk and fat and hairy, he was the anti Thor to every other Thor portrayals & it wasn't because of what he went through it was because of how he was written. The characters develop properly in this and while there isn't many major arcs in the film involving characters the one of Tony stark from, being afraid to do anything because of the fear of losing his daughter or his daughter losing him transcending into the hero that defeated Thanos and died in the process, was not only touching but poetic, the sounds of sobbing where heard in the theatres and it was a (forgive the pun) stark reminder of what the characters mean to people here in the real world. Character score 7/10Motivations\nEvery movie has the characters that motivations make no sense - this film is no different , however as of writing this, I cannot find a world breaking character motivation that took me away from the film, they all had goals and did what they needed to do to achieve those goals. With one of the exception, when evil nebula comes back from the past, everyone seems to forget about her while sorting out the infinity stones, which felt like a plot device to allow her to bring Thanos to the future.\nMotivations 9/10Soundtrack\nThe best part of the score was the nostalgic soundtracks when different characters were introduced and combined with the current score, the music in this film is generic and nothing to write home to, there is a distinct lack of strong motivating soundtrack to pump you up nor one to bring you down when needed, for me this was one of the most disjointing parts of the film .Soundtrack score 3/10Pacing\nThe film has a pacing issue, go figure a 3 hour movie with a pacing issue, there are scenes and segments where it is clear, this section is for laughing, this section is for going wow, this is the sad section and felt extremely stretched, the first 1 hour and a half was the hardest part to get through pacing wise, when we are so used to a full film being over by this stage, I feel there is many parts of this film that could be cut out to make it more streamline without compromising the final product.\nThe final act approx 1 hour 10 minutes of the film goes extremely fast while the first 2 acts seem to almost double in length when watching it. Pacing score 5/10Design\nThere is not much to say about the design of the world they create, everything is as it should be, the time machine looked great and believable, Thanos ships & warriors, every planet (most of which we have seen before) were done almost flawlessly - the only concern I had was the look of Thanos when moved and fought, seemed extremely ridged and choppy, not sure if that is to do with where I watched it on, but it was jarring. Design score 8.5 out of 10Re-watch ability\nThis is where this part of the review gets tricky, there are parts that are extremely fun and enjoyable to watch over and over again, give me the first 15 minutes and the last hour, but to go through the choppy paced part of the film when you already know what is happening, is a task, a movie like this which has many ups and downs within it, its a journey and one I will not be partaking a 3rd time any time soon. It does take a lot out of you physically and emotionally & reliving those emotional moments tends to make them less of an impact & with those moment this films climax would not stand up. Re-watch ability score 6/10Heart\nThis movie does have heart, it is the one key factor that I find in more of the grittier comicbook film I tend to enjoy more, there is a joyfulness that is thrown in there in times of stress , undercutting the tension of the film, this is what I call marvel-ing for everything serious you have you must immediately undercut it with something else, normally this is one of my biggest pet peeves about marvel films as of late but for what ever within the confines of this film I felt them more necessary then ever, the characters interaction with each other and the care you can see is not just an act make this movie much more than I expected. Heart score 9/10\nAdding the totals I give the film a review of 70.5% Making it the 5th highest aggregate score\nThat being Said, I did thoroughly enjoy the film and do recommend it.",

This was the perfect culmination of everything from the past 11 years, and it was everything I want personally from a Marvel Movie, which is experimenting with different genres within superhero movies (I shall not reveal said genres as that's technically a spoiler). Everyone gives their best performances as their characters in the whole saga, even Jeremy Renner, who I do like, but I acknowledge isn't great, and neither is Hawkeye. But what really pisses me off, is that the MCU is still going. This was the perfect finale, but NO, Marvel needs some more dollar-dollar. But regardless, I had a great time watching this film.",

    "reviewTitle": "Not actioned packed however...nice wrap up!",
    "reviewBody": "The bulk of the film is set five years after the events of Infinity Wars.Ok let's start with the negatives:\nCGI of some of our favourite characters appear to be slightly on the poor side. The CGI is quite noticable in some scenes.Secondly...It's very long and as a whole does not have much action. It is more dramatic. This is not a bad thing, however some fans may expect more action in this genre of film.On a postive note, it brings the characters back together very well.Unfortunately it appears this film too has become a victim of \"feminism\", with an unnecessary girl power \"we got this\" scene featuring Captain Marvel and a number of supporting female cast. Why unnecessary? Because viewers will note that Captain Marvel could have quite easily conducted the task at hand with little or no assistance.The cast have done a great job with plenty of little cameo's from our favourite and not so favourite characters of the MCU. The film presents itself as a good wrap up to the 22 film series. Prepare yourselves for some laughs and for some tears.Btw...there is no post credit scene so no need to wait till the end of the rolling credits.If you have an opportunity, go watch the film at the cinemas as it is still worth the watch in a cinematic environment. Just make sure you go to the toilet before the movie starts due to the length of the film.Happy watching!A job well done to both producers and directors.",

They were the only disappointing things everything else was everything you'd want. My heart is in pieces to see what has happened to the original six and no one could ever replace them. This movie is worth your money but I warn you. Bring tissues. You'll want them. To see 2 killed, 1 about to die, a burnt hand, a father who has a family so is a retired avenger, and now my favourite super hero is fat. This must be the end to the MCU and I hope that there isn't another avengers movie that replaces the OG avengers",

I got what I wanted and nothing more, theres nothing bad in that of course.I think that the main actors did a pretty good job, the emotional scenes in the end worked fairly well. However a lot of scenes felt very rushed. I am aware that in three hours a franchise spanning for over 10 years was getting its closure, but it really ruined some scenes specially in the beginning.A lot of the plot points were happening because of stupid coincidences like Hulk getting down the stairs the exact moment, that was a load of bs. It was funny, I guess but it was stupid. I have that problem with every Marvel films the humour. It really hurts scenes that are suppose to make you chocked or sad. This movies is filled with these three liners and it gets repetitive very fast.Overall fun movie I dont regret watching but will not watch again. Mostly because of the run time but yeye",

    "reviewTitle": "Flash Review: A must for MCU fans, but don't think too hard",
    "reviewBody": "The Set-upThe Time Travel plot device to end the Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been speculated ever since the post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp showed Scott Lang/Ant-Man getting trapped in the Quantum Realm.Any time you use Time Travel as a plot device in a movie, it raises a LOT of questions on how paradoxes are avoided. BUT this is a Marvel movie, so we wave our Sorcerer Supreme hands and ignore things that would be scrutinized in a hard science fiction film.So. Three acts.First Act: The StakesTo me this was the best part of the whole movie. We visit with the original Avengers, first a few days after the events of Infinity War, then again five years later to see how they're dealing with their losses. This is the difference between the MCU and the DCEU - the MCU spends time with the characters' motivations and the stakes involved. When they fight not just another meaningless CGI-laden battle. This act ends with the return of Scott Lang and the formulation of the plan to recover the people Thanos killed in Infinity War.Second Act: The HeistsIt's fitting that Ant-Man triggers this series of events, because this act feels like the original Ant-Man movie. Still a lot of nice interaction between the surviving heroes, and the environments that they visit. The act ends when they all succeed, but at what price?Third Act: The EndgameOf course there's a final battle to end the movie and the current Phase of the MCU, complete with transitions, consequences, surprises and all-out CGI action as only the Russos can deliver. It's a totally satisfying climactic encounter.EpiloguePeriods and question marks for the characters that we've journeyed with for twenty-two films.Post-credits scenesThere aren't any. Unless you count a post-credits sound effect, which could mean anything.Reviewer's Tilt7/10. Unfortunately I think about time travel plot holes too much, and this impacts how much I enjoyed the movie, so I docked it a point for that, but it's still a solid entry and a worthwhile end to this Phase of the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Well made ending of an era but the execution was lazy",
    "reviewBody": "First of all, from a critics perspective, the movie had everything to be a complete success. The visuals were amazing, the soundtrack was a perfect underline to every scene and the plot contained several unexpected twists. However, the movie just didn't do it for me personally.Before I start complaining, I went in that movie with high expactations, due to it being the grand finale to an 11 years ongoing era, but was open for everything to happen.Except for just enough things that made me feel like it wasn't the finale I wished to see.Starting with the attack on Thanos in the first part of the movie. It was too fast and too easy to be the follow up of Infinity War. Thanos killed our beloved characters but the revenge for it just wasn't satisfiying and felt like they want to get rid of him as fast as possible just to bring his former conquerer self on screen to have a villain to fight.\nIt was surprising, but it wasn't a good surprise.Second, the humour felt kinda off. Don't get me wrong, the jokes were great and I laughed at some of them, but often they were misplaced. For such a serious situation, there were to many jokes.\nFat Thor was hilarious, but I would have liked this in the probably upcoming Asguardians of the galaxy movie, where they just chill in space and get fat, but not in the finale of an era.The solution for defeating Thanos, undo the snap and what they had to do for it were just to easy. I never had the feeling, that they were risking something. For every problem, there was a fast solution. There wasn't a moment where the stakes were high. It felt like \"yeah just do it\".Additionally, I think the Russo brothers went full safe mode with the happenings. Everything the fans wanted to see was in it. Wich sounds great, but there wasn't any real surprise. It felt like I knew exactly what will happen next and how the movie ends (just a note here: I tried to avoid any trailers or theories, so I went in that movie only with my own thoughts about it). It was indeed a good storyline, but way to predictable.Also, the movie was slow paced, but the important scenes, for example the comeback of all characters at the final battle, did not have enough time to breathe. There was so much happening at that battle, that every reunion was so fast and rushed. More time for it would have made it more emotional.These are just a few things that bothered me. Nevertheless there are a lot of good things as well.The movie took its time to have as much of a goodbye to the characters as possible.\nThe chemistry between the characters was on point.\nThe timetravels to the old movies were a great recap of what happened.\nTony's death and the funeral were emotional as hell.Overall, the movie just isn't the worthy finale for an unbelievebly well made cinematic universe. It did everything to be a good ending but lacked the surprises as a consequence. It is a must watch for fans, but as a movie itself it is by far not as good as Infinity War.",

Had the right amount of humour & Thor was really good in this one. The Black Widow/Hawkeye scene for the stone, I had no idea what way that was going to go. The hug between Tony & Peter had me choking up, a beautiful touch. The all female cast leading a fight scene was tremendous. Tony steps up for the ultimate sacrifice. Cap finally gets his dance. It was the perfect goodbye & they sign off at the start of the credits. A goodbye to most the originals. Done in a wonderful way that Marvel perfected.Also, No credit scene",

    "reviewBody": "A personal review. I really lived up to this moment to finally see Endgame and had such high expectations. They didn't really came true though...It's absolutely worth the watch, but I think people, just like me, might be a bit disappointed.I think certain characters got way too much screentime like hawkeye and captain america, while others got way too little.\nSome scenes really could be skipped, there's so much unnecessary talking and just too little action.I'm a huge Loki fan, so i really hoped he would return and would get a bigger role in this one, but elas... he is in it, luckily, but way too short. A really big missed upportunity. Of course they brought Gamora back, but no Loki.... :(\nThe directors just dismissed him as they have their obvious favorite characters.Thor being fat and all was funny in the beginning but later it just annoyed me. Why doing this to this great character?!Tony was great, cried my eyes out during his death scene and funeral, but the ending with cap... why give his shield to Falcon?!Many missed opportunities. The story could have been much more interesting than this obvious ending.To end positive, the special effects were amazing. You have to see this on the bigscreen.\nThe acting itself is also great.\nSo definitely worth watching, but don't expect too much ;)",

What about the lack of food and other factors? It's just lazy horrible writing.The \"Girl Power\" scene - I get it; I get the female cause, I get wanting a Black Captain America to get that Black Panther dollar too - but it's such lazy writing to have them all find each other on a battle field in that particular way.We're to believe Captain America from 1940 goes back to be with Peggy (now in her late forties, early 50s) and lives a life where he watches his friend Bucky get tortured by Hydra, Shield be betrayed by Hydra despite his wife being a director and all the other travesties so he can just \"live his life\"The bitter-sweet \"But Tony and Pepper have a kid\" - I think the sacrifice that could and should have been made is for Tony to realise that he has to give away the kid in order to return those that were lost to the decimation; i.e the click undoes the last five years and brings them back to the instant that Thanos clicked..",

    "reviewTitle": "Had Superhigh Expectations(din meet them..alas)",
    "reviewBody": "Big Marvel fan!! Wanted to get that out of the way before I start!Its just that the way Infinity war was directed and handled overall, Endgame had to up its game and thats where it fell a bit short, I feel. I knew time travel was always in play(so its not even a spoiler); however the direction, screenplay and science of time travel part was weakly handled. I am a huge time travel concept fan(Primer and Time crimes being the best). With the slow pace in the 1st act establishing the foundation for the rest of the movie, I thought they would do justice to the science, implication and the wit of time travel. So I expected a mature take on it. Three things could have been better to complete the time travel ark:-\n1. The ripples it created in the alternate timeline were spoken of but not addressed at all when things started to go south in the original timeline.\n2. Smart inserts of how original movies had certain scenes which were inexplicible then could have been attributed to this movie's time travel plot. Eg. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the russtle of leaves heard by Hermoine initially was understood when the time travel ark started. Something like that would have made a true Marvel fan giggle with delight. Missed a trick there.\n3. Hulk explained that putting the stones back in its place will kill the offshoot timelines - meaning it could possibly invalidate the movie's timeline too!! But that was not addressed; am sure story writers had thought this through, just couldnt translate that in the screenplay.Its best moments can be summarized under 2 points:-\n1. Humor (not top grade...nonethess prevalent throughout the movie)\n2. NostalgiaBest handled characters in following order:-\n1. Iron Man\n2. Captain America\n3. Thor\n4. Hulk\n5. Hawkeye andRaw deal for characters which were seemingly important for Phase 4 of MCU\n1. Black Widow\n2. Thanos\n2. Dr. Strange\n3. Spiderman\n4. Black Panther\n5. Vision (no screen time??! Unless you consider Howard Stark's driver Jarvis's voice)Although, I seem to be cynical rather than delighted fan with this review, overall I enjoyed the movie; worth a re-watch to catch the missed 1 one liners :)And if someone at Marvel is looking for Ideas to cash-in on nostalgia, Captain America's final scene can be a movie in itself(and hopefully someone will consider in future)!!!Good Luck Marvel...for Phase 4!...Looking forward to!",

    "reviewTitle": "I didn't know I was a fan but I was... But",
    "reviewBody": "I didn't know I was a fan but I was... ButFor the genre not the movie itself.I get fueled by heroism however seeing all the movies and have read 0 comics seen some animated series this end was good not great.A overal weak 6.5-6.7I am no geek for the whole package, franchise but in the impossible.I am here to share my emotions after 0 credit scene and I am full of emotions but confused, sad, empty, serenity.So I am no indepth with writers on this but I do get you want to please everyone but it becomes too much, the Thor part is probably great for many none followers and just for the average viewer, I don't think it is the writers fault but the management, vision.Cause this might the fastest 3 h you sit through and wonder what was what happens and you are left with the will of reseeing it and not in a good way.It might just be me or how I am built but even if it is 2019 and the world is what it is and actors want out, age or what not (didn't stop the cgi) it does get better with time, hence live action.So removing cast completely is just so redundant. This genre is made for the impossible why make it not so, why try and please the other half. It is not that it is unrealistic most is.People spend time remenissing most part of their life or doing things they didn't believe in until they started doing it.Sure raw and gritty but that is why you should never close a door not in this age.Having cast return should always stay open especially if you even after 2008, mind the comics, the length characters have lived even thou animated there could have been openings because the way the closed this chapter is and was rushed.This comes from me and my emotions, even my girlfriend said it was flat.Well ofcourse it was, so many characters in this with 1/3 going for slowpace, drama, not even enough time to shift paste.It is like they wanted to keep the same and all emotions from all movies and still build a story ontop and this in 3 hours time.I am all for everything and I dont need more, this is Imdb. Just using this to lead my emotions for selfclosure where the creators did not.I wish I could say all CGI in the final would satisfy me, pepper Potts spot on send off, every moment but it was a cake, you hade the sprinkle, you had layers, you had frosting but where was the passion, there was humor.You know trying to digg out something that is left missing is not easy, even if one would rage.So my gf said it was flat, as for me vs those who have more backstory and are more forgiving and accept noone can live forever.I get you. I might be that 1 procent but I am still here feeling a bit snuffed because we left the impossible behind.Maybe we don't live in a sustainable world anymore and it drives us to be more realistic and we are controlled more about numbers than guided by our own emotions.But ending it like this feels wrong, so for one printing this directly from my mind and beeing a post genius would could have been different?Well honestly it is not hard to speak for oneself.And you can't change the past as in the movies (yet)However playing with the idea is that pushing the soul stone a definite broke it all but going deeper on the same line would drag things out til the impossible.So giving the time concept multiverse would be the way to go, however. Martyrs are no longer and should have and shall never be glorified even if that embarks emotions.A true hero is one that can overcome all without self-sacrifice.I think this would and should have been the call.This leads us back to infinity war and just the strange writer decision to brand and spoil the envitable plot with the 14 miljon vs 1 outcome.For a company as any company with leaders, writers above all people with vision.A person in time gets better. An object that gets older you threat it with more respect.But with this it seems money and time talks more against than for.It is truly sad that crowd creation and funding didn't go through n before this era for fans and other followers to inject their will into the story arch as it could have.Opens up interesting view upon those who own the rights to shape and have the power to push plot, characters.For one second could have been nice with alternative ending because like Strange writers did it, 14 miljon wrong and one right.However this feel like inaccurate as for realities, infinity the soul stone sacrifice seems to be the only limit.So what is next. Well for me I will mourn Ironman the most as for the rest not as much but still..It is just truly sad everything was pushed to an end than actually have a more organic fallout.Seeing heroes grow old naturally, no time jumping leaving things over in the same pace it has been would have been nice.If I could ask a question it would have been.Why or who made you quit, was it not obvious it was done. Who pushed who, who got left behind so this happened.Was it really time for RDJ to go. And I believe not. This gap needs to be filled and if it was that easy we would have, his portrayed or joint mentality for, in and with his character people need it and copy or act it will not be possible, this is core grinded with each and one of us acting or not and cannot be copied and another replacing will not be possible cause we all realisticly could(have) see(seen) RDJ continue his journey.And this is just RDJ, there are more which falls into the same line. It is just me who connects with RDJ the strongest hence the reference.So needed to spend time writing this up to be able to go to sleep is not as good as I had hoped.But in the world we are shapeing it helps with the impossible when everyone else fails.Let that be a reminder./Cheers n take care <3",

    "reviewBody": "I watched this movie at the world premiere and I am absolutely speechless by the work they have done.The pacing is incredibly good, It doesn't feel like you sit there for 3hrs, more like 1 hr 50 min.The time travel aspect actually works in this movie which I like, because many movies tries time travel and it never really works or it is super complicated. The only thing I don't like about this is this is going to become such a \"Deus ex Machina\" to the franchise going on.There was one death that shocked me and the ending to the top 2 avengers were great. Iron man and Captain America both went out with the way I wanted them to go.I also love that characters like Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Nebula and Hulk got so much screen time.The only things I did not like about this movie is the business aspect. It's very obvious that Audi has a deal with Marvel when Tony Stark drives his Audi and parks it in front of the camera for 5 seconds flashing the logo. I also did not like the Fortnite reference with Thor and Korg. The kids in the cinema loved it but it just got way to corny.My favorite quote from the movie is Tony Stark's reference to \"The Big Lebowski\" that was personally my favorite joke.Marvel did it again and I seriously don't know how they can top this in phase 4.\nThank you to the Russo brothers for making an incredible masterpiece9/10",

For the records, Chris Evans which played Captain America handed an adamantium shied to a successor. Chris Evans is irreplaceable. I am not sure whether to watch Captain America sequel again under different role. Both characters are awesome.Robert Downey Jr. died. The ever gorgeous Scarlett Johansson died. I am quite sure marvel will find a way to undo their death as how the vanished halves of the superheroes were brought back to life in the movie. Avengers will no longer be that great without the abovesaid names playing respective superheroes - because Evans, Johansson, and downey Jr. are indispensable! I don;t care if Tobey McGuire is substituted.10/10 and I am waiting to see whether this mega-blockbuster could beat Titanic as No. 1 highest grossing movie of all time....",

    "reviewBody": "As a casual fan of the MCU (watched most movies, read no comics) it didn't have such an impact on me but it was an enjoyable ride all the same. I was worried at the beginning that the three hours would drag (some scenes were padded, shall we say) but it was no difficulty. Though there was surprisingly little action, it kept my attention throughout. I did find myself getting lost occasionally with all the references to previous movies that I simply couldn't remember well enough.A scene I found particularly effective was the opening with Hawkeye's family. I thought it did well to remind us where we left off without retreading the same ground as before.I found one plot point particularly confusing. I thought Thanos had to sacrifice the thing most dear to him who was coincidentally beside him in the previous movie yet here it seemed like the soul stone just requires whoever happens to be standing next to you. I've got to say the image of the dead body was my favourite though, absolutely stunning.As for humour, some felt misplaced and fell flat but there were a few hilarious moments for sure. Thor is essentially comic relief which may not please some but I enjoyed almost all of his scenes. I just think Chris Hemsworth is such a pro at his delivery.Overall it was a tremendous effort to try to wrap up so many stories in a satisfying way. For most I imagine it will be successful, I just felt it tied too neat a bow on everything. I've got to say I wanted a higher body count, further showing my morbid taste. I had no significant attachment to the characters so my eyes remained completely dry as we progressed through the farewells which rival LOTR for length if not emotion. It was still a very enjoyable ride. I would say Infinity War was more thrilling but Endgame was more polished. Definitely worth a watch.",

    "reviewBody": "Here in China, Avengers-Endgame have been in the cinema for about 24 hours. All people are crazy now. All the cinema only provide this film. If you are a fan, please go as soon as possible. If you are not that crazy or a fan, you can go later to learn more.\nThis time, the Marvel movie give more time to telling the daily life of the after-Thanos life. The helping with each other, the deep sadness in everyone. People tried, people want to move on. But there will be a chance for Stark, Stark is the key. Remember, Doctor Strange is the smartest person in MCU and he give up for a reason.\nThere will be a big fight, there will be a hard fight. But never move your eye off the screen, every move will have a surprise. A tip, bring tissues, you will cry. I missed the Star Wars, the Harry Potter, BUT I AM IN MCU!Hail Hydra. Love you Marvel three thousand times. I will love Tony and Chris for ever. I am IRON MAN. I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY!",

    "reviewTitle": "Near-Perfect Ending",
    "reviewBody": "As the curtain comes down on this phase of MCU films I really need to taper off my rating (just a tad) to ensure I give this film a fair review.The cinematography in this film is 10/10, as well as the sheer tenacity of the plot - and the threads they had to weave to connect it all together in one 3-hour long ride. They have done this to perfection. The utilisation of the different timeframes make for something that no other film has done before, or ever will again. I'll leave this there, as every review will no doubt focus on the positives, I'll focus on the negatives (and keep in mind this movie is still an amazing, 9/10 in my book).One of my gripes do begin with the timeframes they use though, as the \"teams\" they split off into don't all make for the most compelling of stories. War Machine and Nebula didn't add much in the storyline. And even with her doppelgänger taking her place, in the end that didn't really end up going anywhere except to drive Thanos to come to heads with The Avengers back on earth. This is one thing I think they could've done in a better way, potentially replacing the \"doppelgänger\" plot driver to maybe another battle (mid-movie) involving Thanks, that then shapes the rest of the movie.Another gripe is Thor. My personal favourite of the MCU, he (as others have mentioned) is a running joke throughout the whole movie. I would've been fine with a quick 30 second 'montage' to see the God (yes that is important to note as well) get back in 'shape'. It was simply not befitting to the character we have spent so much time with over the years.The one gripe I am MOST 'annoyed' about (if you can call it annoyance, is the fact that in the end, the stakes were lowered by the fact that there was only 1 character death in the whole of the final battle. Unless I am missing something here amongst all that carnage!\nThe fact that all but one (not counting Black Widow) Avenger gets to have their 'ride off into the sunset' happy ending is a bit of a downer for me. I could rewatch that whole sequence (and I'm sure I will) and know that everyone but Ironman is going to be fine. I realise there still needs to be a lot of heroes left to continue on with solo films again (after Endgame). But I feel we should've seen 3-4 deaths from some of Bucky, War Machine, Drax, Mantis, Scarlett Witch, Wong and a few others could have met their end.Apologies if I missed a death in there, I know Thanos used the power stone on someone which may very well have been a death, however it's 1:14am as I type this.But if you've read this far, thank you",

    "reviewTitle": "This.",
    "reviewBody": "To start off, i would give it 9.5 if i could. To say this movie is good is an understatement. The fact that this even exist should not be possible yet it is and somehow it doesn't only exists. It's also great. I somewhat feel like this is something that is looked over. People are taking this stuff for granted. I repeat myself in saying. This should not exists. There shouldnt be 22 movies within the same franchise that all are this well connected and not to mention that literally each and every one (with few exceptions) are either good, great or mediocre. Not one that is objectivly bad, except maybe Thor 2...The mere fact is that they built up for this conclusion in 10 years worth of movies and the result is a movie that is consistent, true to the character and established world and is most importantly still enjoyable. This is very much an end of an era and they couldn't have done it better.Now bellow will be spoilers so if you for some reason ignored the spoiler wanring and read this far i advice you not to continue. You want to see this movie with no knowledge.The ending for our main heroes is great. Lets start by saying that keeping Thor is great, his character still has a place to grow from and i think he will fit with the Guardians.Steve Rogers. I would have been satisfied and not surprised if they chose to end him in battle. Yet they made something so much more beautiful. I cannot stress enough how perfect his ending is. Leaving over the shield. But most importantly, retiring. He was a soldier but even those need to settle down. The ending shot of him with Peggy dancing is one of the most beautiful parts of any marvel movie if not the best. Such a great way to end his story - where he started. In a life that was stolen.Tony goddamned Stark. There couldn't have ended in any other way. Tony is a fighter, no matter how much he tries to fool himself he will always fight. Unoike Steve he could never live out his life in peace, this is why his ending is so perfect. Doing whats right. For the better of others. From his last words to his voice memo telling his daughter he loves her 3000. Tony Stark does have a heart.The plot is also something i'll briefly comment on. What a great way to end such an epic and long stort - by literally going back to where it started. They made sure the infinity stones would be gone and yet made a conclusive and good way to do it. They made the losses feel real and you were on the edge of your seat watching.Lastly i want to explaib why it isn't a 10 in my book. Now obviiusly for a 10 the lovie ought to be perfect and while i biew this to be so in many ways there are a few small issues i had. I really felt like some of the jokes, such as the fortnite one, didn't really fit for me. Ialso still think Cpt Marvel is overpowered and boring - however they made sure to keeo her away which i appreciated. I also disliked the cgi on Thor's Peter B Parker belly. These are just nitpicks and overall they didnt stop me from lovint this lovie.Tl;dr APPRECIATE THIS, Remember that this movie should bot be possible yet it is and its great. Watch it and enjoy it. Don't spoil it for anyone though.",

    "reviewTitle": "GREATEST MOVIE",
    "reviewBody": "I have already written a review but I wanna say that this movie was amazing, but they made past thanos far too strong, he was able to beat every single avenger and bearly bleed. They made Thor like 80% weaker in this than infinity war, and disappointed me in the last 5-10mins with making captain America too old to be an avenger meaning they lose three avengers to death ( as cap would be dying by age ), Thor too fat, hulk has a burnt arm and hawk eye is a father.\nNow with the positives this is my favourite marvel/ action/ superhero movie. This has the BEST end fight scene, great action scenes, emotional and humorous scenes. I laughed, clapped and was nearly going to cry as some of the best avengers dies, and the others physically cannot go on anymore as an avenger. This really wraps up the infinity saga and the Russo's have our done themselves and Stan ( then man ) Lee would be very proud. The movie had a great twist to it and really surprised me. Many times my heart was racing throughout the movie. The movie's worth every minute. So get up get out that door and watch this movie over and over again as it is the last movie for some of our favourite cast. And don't forget your tissues.",

Notice how that Scott lang did not change becuse of the quantom tec.This movie is not perfect with many plot holes and some wasted characters but that does not make this movie worseThis movie is great and im happy i saw saw it",

You guys can make the whole team Avengers fight together.Anw, dont waste your time to see the post credit #finger cross#\nMe cannot wait to see MCU series in the next future.

    "reviewTitle": "Sigh, it was everything that was expected (Spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "TL;DR: A lot of rambling from me, wished for more epic ending.What an utter and complete disappointment. Gonna list some things I didn't like first.I went to this movie with expectations that Tony is the one to die from the Big 3. Reasoning being that in my opinion ( Since seeing ending of BP) Marvel is obviously setting MJ (Spider-Man) to be a Power Duo with Shuri ( Black Panther's Sister) now that she is head of the Wakanda's NY Embassy. and hey someone needs to fix Spider-Man's new nanosuit right? Iron Woman inc? MJ can take Pepper's suit, and someone can post on Reddit how Chekov's Gun her reading a Recycling book was.Really disappointed for that tony death, even more disappointed how they handled it.Time travel also happens, that was lame AF. I hoped writers would have actually surprised us, feels like shitty writing.Complete victory. Traded Black Widow and Stark for victory? Talk about a cheap win.\nThere was no point in the movie were it felt like the stakes were high and Avengers were actually losing something. From start to finish its just a victory parade IMO.\nSerious lack of dialogue! I really wanted more 1 on 1 discussions between the characters I.E Bucky and Captain talking before he time jumps at the end, Nebula commenting on why she shot herself, Myabe Thanos commenting that maybe he lacked experience that 9 year older Thanos had, Captain Marvel speaking whole sentence, or just something!\nMost discussions between characters were just humor stuff , nothing meaningful or long. Dialogue really feels soulless to me, factory mill quality.MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, so ruined RUINED I SAY, if u remember at the end of Infinity War, We see Thanos' Hut, well when I saw it first time, I thought it was Hawkeye's Hut. I was expecting to see Hawkeye happy and smiling eating with his family when the SNAP happens, and he has to watch everyone dust while passing the salad. God damn the Endgame scene of dusting his family lacks any emotional impact. and the Hawkeye's actor could have carried that scene 100%! His face on Endgame trailer, really says how ashamed he is what he has become, how he is angry at himself and the shame he feels because Nat saw him like that. This was the thing I was most hyped about!!! and talking about lack of dialogue man Hawkeye - Captain America interaction would have been nice.I wish they had spent more effort on the #Metoo scene. I hate to call it that. but that is what it felt like. It should have been longer. No actress got to really do anything on that, and I still didn't get my fill of Pepper Potts being a badass warrior, just like with Iron Man 3. Also pissed that Maria Hill wasn't included (not even in the movie god damn). Maybe Marvel hates Canada (hi mum!). Worst thing about it was how Valkyrie's Pegasus was completely fine after taking a shot from the Mothership cannon, even all pure white still lol.Falcon becoming Captain America and Valkyrie becoming a Queen , both come out of left field for me. When did Valkyrie show any leadership qualities? Bizarre.\nAnd on Falcon's case it doesn't feel like he has earned it. at least not yet. Guess I am excited for Falcon solo movie now and reserve judgement until then on that call.Oh yeah, Loki's death received no mention in whole movie huh. also shame no Hela. Would have loved to see Thor ask about her from the Mother.Black Order was a joke, again, just like in IW, although way bigger joke this time around. Shame.Soulstone Gang each getting a action scene looked hilarious stupid to me. Okey 1st Spider-Man show you are here, now Panther, Strange get the ocean and so on.\nThis is the Final Movie, how the hell do u not top all the other Avenger group battle scenes by miles?? Lack of effort is insane IMO. Yes I like Portals but am not giving a free pass because of them god damnit.Marvel failed to stop the Captain marvel Deus Ex Machina.I would have appreciated a better,longer fight scene with Danvers and Thanos. That Scene really felt like a writer was jerking off \" Look u baby audience am empowering a woman and giving Stark idea what to do, I AM A GENIUS\" . Sorry, it just looked so cliche and stupid easy. Would probably have been fine without the Strange-Stark eye-to-eye stuff. Cinematography left a lot to be desired on all that.Would have liked to see bigger movement to try to move on after the snap than just an AA meeting.Wanted more Nebula-Stark scenes.\nThen NEUTRAL STUFF, all this stuff felt like \"duh obviously, its not like anything eelse even could happen, but it was still good\"Hulk Fusion\nHawkeye-Black Widow exchange\nCaptain America staying backThe GOOD STUFF\nThor's depression. I don't have the writing skills to praise enough Hemsworth's performance or writing on that. He was definitely my favorite part of this movie. Just a shame that him being little chubby didn't show in the fight scenes or impact his fighting ability.\nCaptain getting the Scepter with \"Hail Hydra\" . also love that they teased a elevator fight. Will probably watch Winter Soldier tomorrow!Captain America and the Hammer, expected , but damn I love how he fights with the hammer.Rating:I am giving this movie the lowest marvel movie rating I have ever given. It is not the worst Marvel movie for me, that Honor belongs to Dr. Strange (its so damn boring and slow paced and I even love all the actors in it), BUT this is supposed to be the epic finale for the 1st arch of MCU, and in that it utterly fails. and the score reflects that failure.It also suffers from Infinity War (My favorite MCU Movie) being so damn good, and pales in comparison sadly.This really reminds me of how my favorite Game of Thrones episodes are mostly 2nd last episodes and how I haven't liked almost any of the season endings.If I would have to guess, its because when you are good at writing, there is one logical outcome that fits the story you have been building and people that have seen a lot of movies, can figure it out. And I hate having figured out the story, I always want to be surprised when watching a movie! For it to go far and beyond my expectations. Didn't happen this time.Thanks for bothering to read this if you did!",

Come on.\n2. The time-travel-solution was so predictable but Thanos intervening using nebula saved the night.\n3. Ioved the Loki's scene and whole thing back in 2012\n4. Cap. America saying heil hydra > him holding the hammer\n5. The scene where all the female characters protecting the gauntlet was amazing\n6. Tony hugging peter overwhelmed everyone\n7. The comeback of the snapped champs right away to the battle 👌🏻👌🏻\n8. Falcon becomes the new cap is lame\n9. I expected much more from Thanos and Thor ( considering his role and his Strombreaker in infinity war)\n10. Tony Stark left me speechless, Was pissed off at the beginning but then thought he got his epic ending fitting his rule and importance in MCU. He will be missedYet Amazing , entertaining and breathtaking movie and nice budget bringing back almost everyone.\nAn end of era!!!",

    "reviewBody": "The story was really good and there are a lot of funny moments in this movie and also prepare to cry. But there are a few scenes that I did not like.1. Fortnite. When they showed this (in my opinion) terrible game it did completely destroy the immersion for me during this scene. It simply was extremely out of place.2. It was weird how Thor got his hammer \"back\". This was in the past and the Thor from that timeline was also there so our Thor basically stole the hammer from that past timeline Thor. Nobody mentioned this and Frigga did not seem to care at all. I was expecting the other Thor to try and get his own hammer back but nothing happened. It was really odd. Also speaking of Thor, I didnt like that they made him look all chubby and turn him into an alcoholic. It was funny at first but later I just wanted the old Thor back. Hopefully in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 he will get his normal look again.3. The movie indeed was predictable for the most part. I did not expect Black Widow to die though, that was a shocker for me.Everything else was perfect and expecially that final battle with Thanos was just spectacular. I had goosebumps many times. Tonys death was the saddest part of the movie and in my Theatre many people cried. I also had to fight with tears. I thought I was prepared but it hit me too hard. Tony always was my favourite Character but he got the perfect ending. Giving his life to save the world.",

Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",

    "reviewBody": "I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If \"Return of the King\" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it.",

    "reviewTitle": "A fitting farewell to an incredible era",
    "reviewBody": "DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5",

The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful.

I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years.",

It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga.",

The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater.",

    "reviewTitle": "Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics. Brilliant, and worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008.",
    "reviewBody": "THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films, it has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the franchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with heart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. That's no small feat, and it's even more remarkable that a movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesn't fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy script or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCU's crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers, their stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxy's population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing witness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with the crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into darkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...THE GREAT: Endgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a decade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save their families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the film's comic relief, but both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to juggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels virtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the staggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved characters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in stitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers' genius and their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is emphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you understand what the heck is going on if you haven't watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few logical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from the wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt tribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it includes Stan Lee's final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce the interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie that started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around the character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of Marvel Comics' more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencer's run on Captain America: Steve Rogers.)CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCU's core strengths, with Oscar winners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting strategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but manage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all. Hemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm and intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and Renner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces. Evans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a man who's - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films belongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully conveys every shade and layer of his character's hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have never needed that Tony Stark has a heart.RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine emotion. It's the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and it's worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008.",

It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one.",

And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry.

That said...there isn't a whole lot more TO say. If Infinity War was your cup of tea, Endgame is going to do everything you want it to... but not in the way you expect it to. Yes, there's a measure of predictability; but there's also plenty of surprises - a mix of both, really, which feels just about right.My feelings a few hours after seeing Endgame are as follows: Sad, a little depressed that some things will never be the same going forward. I know all good earthly things have an end - sometimes it's a little difficult to accept. In a way, the good ol' days are now officially \"old\". On the flip side of the coin, I'm a little exuberant about the possibilities opened up, the new concepts explored, and probably more than anything, the completely perfect fanfare that had the folks at my cinema cheering and applauding at every turn. In other words, I'm experiencing mixed emotions. Decipher my very cryptic notes as you will... but see Endgame for yourself. It's hardly something to be missed. And it's hardly something to be forgotten.Some people move on. But not us.Not us.",

I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.",

    "reviewBody": "Avengers: Endgame (2019, Russo Brothers)So the culmination of eleven years worth of set up in this Marvel Cinematic Universe that feels like an episodic tv series is about to have its finale and its a big one... over three hours. This film is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally gravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first hour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these surviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun hijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all pretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story point of view bar some small missteps here and there.",

    "reviewBody": "After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant.\nIt is the grande finale.",

I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel.",

It delivers on all fronts!\nThere were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.\nThere were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.\nThey tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.\nThere are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers: Endgame sticks the landing",
    "reviewBody": "Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before.",

    "reviewTitle": "when over the top is just right",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled \"Avengers: Infinity War Part 2\", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos?\nWhat role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play?\nWill those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life?\nWill Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space?\nWho will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's \"we hear you\" statement. Much of what we see is \"inevitable\", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'.",

Very good.Q: Did it feel like 3 hours?\nA: No... even though it was fairly leisurely paced for about the first hour or so, I never felt bored or restless.Q: Did it meet expectations?\nA: More or less- and they were high to begin with.Q: How necessary is it to watch the previous Marvel movies before this one?\nA: Very. This has the most call-backs to the previous MCU movies out of any so far, which is fitting given that it's an \"ending\" of sorts to the previous 20 or so movies.Q: Did you cry?\nA: No, but I'm jaded and wouldn't be surprised if other people did.Q: Did you laugh?\nA: Yeah it was pretty funny, without sacrificing the more serious stuff. Similar to how the humour was handled in Infinity War.Q: Speaking of Infinity War, was it better than Endgame?\nA: I dunno, hard to say right now. They're both about on the same level for me.Q: How was the Stan Lee cameo?\nA: A bit rubbish to be honest, especially if this is to be his last.Q: You gonna keep watching these Marvel movies after this one?\nA: Probably. If this is the last one I ever saw I think I could live with that. But if there are still interesting stories to tell and talented filmmakers who want to make them, then I'll be there.",

    "reviewTitle": "Most definitely the most anticipated film of the year.",
    "reviewBody": "Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general.",

    "reviewBody": "This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest I'll go in terms of talking about what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt, and that's performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know these characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see these characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldn't imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big screen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with not much knowledge about Marvel wouldn't make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of understanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must acknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours completely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22 movies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come to, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that I've ever seen. Make sure not to miss a single minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right choices, bringing an emotional tone we've never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny problems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to the point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just don't land, especially in one scene at the very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didn't really matter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesn't feel that long whatsoever, maybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers: Endgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America: Civil War right below it. There are many theories online, and I'm aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all of them aren't even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, there's no after credits, it doesn't matter how long you stay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene.",

    "reviewBody": "Well, this has been what we all have been waiting for quite some time now. 10 years in making, characters we grew find of and vast and complex storylines. They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening night and couldn't wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched almost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasn't blown away. The problem for me was that while I was enjoying the movie, I couldn't help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden I wasn't that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other Marvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I don't know whether they had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial that were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting. There were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart and lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have already had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale) should be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been following the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has been wasted in this way.",

The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.",

    "reviewBody": "This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great.\nI can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day.\nEnjoy :)\nI actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10.",

    "reviewBody": "Surely Forrest Gump must rate as one of the biggest dupes of all time. Quite how the marketeers managed to pass this off as a great film is beyond my powers of reason. Tom Hanks plays the intellectually challenged Gump and picked up his second consecutive Oscar for his over the top portrayal. A spectacular job considering the Academy do not normally fall for the same ploys as the movie going public. Even more spectacular when you consider that Morgan Freeman was nominated for The Shawshank Redemption. Gump was the Best Film winner as well, even though Pulp Fiction AND The Shawshank Redemption were nominated. I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years or Dazed and Confused, nice but nothing special. It's little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how it affected one man, namely Mr Gump. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gump's Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field is well cast as Gump's mother, beyond that there is not much to redeem Gump, the effects are very nicely added if nothing new and the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers. For the most part it's too mushy, way too sentimental and just not much above mediocre. In years to come the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump.",

I particularly liked the war scenes when it resembled many Vietnam War classics. But to put one genre summarising Forrest Gump, it has to be Romance, for the 40 year relationship between Jenny and Forrest has the most memorable scenes.",

However, it is rather well made, with very nice production values, and some appropriate casting, namely Sally Field. Hanks, however, doesn't do the moron thing as well as say, Bill Murray might have done it.

Among those is FORREST GUMP, which proved Tom Hanks as an acclaimed dramatic actor. The tale of a young man living through the life and times is among the many landmarks existing in cinema today. No one understood that the nostalgic visuals and props (plus the legless Gary Sinise) were actually real and not copied or duplicated, meaning an Oscar winner. It is both funny, serious, and heartbreaking for one entire movie, but it isn't labeled as a \"comedy\" like many have called it. The film greatly shows Hanks maturity after his comical heydays, and it continues on. It also shows the way past generations of time are reborn in this present, but disillusioned era. FORREST GUMP is a bona fide genuine classic that will stick around in future generations to come. I ADMIT IT!",

This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as \"simple truths\" much like its foggy-headed main character.  Not so.  It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues.

    "reviewTitle": "Stupid is as stupid does, and \"Forrest Gump\" proves it",
    "reviewBody": "I was surprised to find so many others who held the same opinion as I about the movie \"Forrest Gump\".  The nation laughed and cried along with Forrest throughout the course of the movie and through pure visceral emotion, resulted in Academy Awards out the wazoo.  If this movie evoked any kind of response out of me, I might say it made me cry... out of pure boredom.  I was disappointed in the ridiculousness of \"Forrest Gump\", a lot of the reason being because I hold Tom Hanks in such high regard and never once thought that he would be one to promote the patronizing American Dream theory.  It completely blows my mind that this movie received so many awards and so much hype when it is utterly unbelievable and absolutely unrealistic. The braces bursting from Forrest's legs, his unintentional football scholarship to college, his meeting the president (and might I add his only words to Mr. Kennedy were \"I have to go pee\"), his millions earned through ping-pong, his (how pathetic) running across America four times for \"no reason at all\", his \"inventing\" the happy face symbol by wiping his face on a towel... all this is just incredibly... stupid, if I may be so blunt.  The movie attempts to show that to succeed in life, one does not need to be overly intelligent, all one needs is a lot of heart.  Very touching, but dense all the same and the movie is so far out that viewers only see it as entertainment and will not derive motivation to make something of themselves.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job and is convincing as a mentally-challenged man, but the movie as a whole, the supposed \"story-line\" and non-existent plot are pathetic and hold no ground.  \"Forrest Gump\" deserved no awards in my opinion.",

    "reviewBody": "It never ceases to amaze me that many folks heap criticism onto this very simple and wonderful FAIRY TALE.  They look for complexity and messages where there are none, then cannot buy into the obviously fantastic and utterly improbable life of Forrest Gump due to the irrationality involved, and then somehow miss the entire point of the movie!Simply because it is set in modern times some look to this fairy tale for messages about right wing conservatism, the USA's role in Vietnam, the American Dream, etc.It's not about any of those things.  It's about a simpleton who knows what love, loyalty, family, and friendship are, and their importance in life. It's about those around him who come to realize that perhaps the simpleton has more of a clue as to what is TRULY important in life than they do.Hanks' performance is excellent, as is Robin Wright's and Gary Sinise's. The direction is also top notch, as is the sound track, special effects, and scenery.  Heck, it's just a pretty damn awesome movie.This movie will be remembered as the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" of our generation.Mark",

Surely this is not what the movie makers intended but that's the way it came across on me.Besides that I must say that Tom Hanks does an excellent acting job, and for that alone the film is actually worth watching...but not a classic.",

    "reviewBody": "Today I watched the original version for the first time, not having seen the German-dubbed version for some time. And I was really amazed how I couldn't hold back my tears. This movie is a masterpiece! I remembered that I had also cried the previous times I had watched that movie. But I wasn't really driven to tears by any movie during the last months and so I thought I might have grown kind of too tough to be really touched. And then I watched Forrest Gump again and at least five times a stream of water broke off in my eyes. Scenes like Jenny's return, Forrest naming his shrimps-boat \"Jenny\", the last conversation with his mother or the final scene by Jenny's grave - oh, and when he meets his son... Oh boy! I even started to cry before I saw these scenes because I already knew what happens and that sole expectation was enough to make me cry. I haven't experienced so MUCH and so TRUE and so INEVITABLE emotion in a movie for a very long time. I would go on enumerating all the scenes where I cried, because I love Forrest's pure love for Jenny so much, I love his relationship with his mother, I love his loyalty against Bubba and I love his friendship with Lieutenant Dan... I just love the movie!But of course a really good movie as it is, is not only built on water. It's also a very funny movie. You won't laugh half as loud as you will during movies like \"The Naked Gun\"(if you like them), but there is no less humour. The appearance of icons like JFK, Elvis and John Lennon and the - more or less honest - intention to chronicle American history from the 1950s to the 1980s belong to this humour. All these events are made ridiculous and dealt with as though they were rather unimportant, but they also make up the movie. Things look less disturbing, when you see them through the eyes of Forrest Gump! He doesn't understand what's going on and doesn't take it seriously. But would you hate him therefore? No. Do you think you'd have to pity him? No.All the characters are fantastic. Forrest, the moron, who is so wonderfully naive that he would deserve and obtain all the happiness of the world. The proud and unconventional mother, misguided but through and through good-hearted Jenny, dedicatedly silly-stuff-talking Bubba and especially Lieutenant Dan, who is such an interesting and wonderfully created character. Gary Sinise plays him as such a jerk in terms, but always likeable and understandable. All other actors are no less fantastic, but I don't want to extend this to far. My rating, of course, is a clear 10!",

And i've also got to say, that Sally Field and Gary Snise are the best supporting actors i ever watched. They are also very well.I love the Forrest Gump's script. It's very good!! And the direccion was pretty good too.Finally, i think Forrest Gump show us the american way in his best and greatest form; and this movie make us think about what is really important in life.

This film is absolutely phenomenal. I saw this in 3rd hour English today and this film just went and tugged at my heart strings.

    "reviewTitle": "Forrest Gump: The kind of Genius we REALLY need!",
    "reviewBody": "First of all, Forrest Gump was an excellent film.  The emotions was real, the action was real, the characters were real, and plausible, some coincidences were extreme, but did nothing to hurt the movie.People seem to be angered at the fact that the character of Forrest Gump attains so much success, let alone his lack of \"intelligence.\"  I believe this is the point that the author tried to make.  Forrest Gump may have had a childish, naive common sense, but he succeeded anyway, and with flying colours.  His innocence kept him from being tempted by greed, thus hurting himself and others. Honestly, if there were more Forrest Gumps  around, the world would be a better place (don't mean to sound sentimental).All the characters are used well to convey the image of the time.  Forrest's mother, and old-fashioned, good-hearted lady is typical of the time.  Jenny, falling into a drug crazed orgy during the seventies, pays for it by contracting AIDs a plausible fate for her actions.  Lieutenant Dan, a typical war vet, whom sees no reason for life without the ability to be normal shows us how to respect life in it's fullest.  Bubba, the sentiment character who is killed in battle at Forrest's side, leads to further events in the story well.The theme of success, happiness and awe of the world is well portrayed in the \"running\" scene where Forrest runs across america twofold.And possibly the most subtle, yet important theme of running away, is used with excellence.  From \"Run Forrest, Run\" to the scene with Forrest carrying Bubba from battle, to the football antics, and finally the \"Run across america\" scenes are genius.   Forrest was always a good runner, running away from his fears, running away from himself and running away from the truth. The one thing he did not run away from was Jenny, in fact he was running to Jenny. This emotional love-story may be a little \"storybook\" but it shows the power of love in everyone, even the handicapped.This film was excellent, I don't see how anyone could give it anything under 7/10 stars.I personally give it 9/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Stupid is as stupid does. So we do...",
    "reviewBody": "First, I'd like to say that this movie is formidably made. Referring to acting, storyline and the astonishing FX I couldn't do more than repeating things other admirers of FG have already said. It's got all in it: comedy, romance and the fuel a movie needs to work: the \"I wonder how it'll all end!\" that keeps (most of) the audience with this character throughout this quite long film.I can't agree with the points often critizised about FG. And, honestly, I think that the less subtle the critics are, the more hurt is their U.S. patriotism. First, If you wonder if something is realistic here, you should stop watching movies. One good thing about FG is, that it isn't supposed to be realistic, though it almost convinces you that it is, but it is far too overdone to be so. It is meant to be a fable, like Benigni's \"La vita e bella\".\"Stupid is as stupid does\" is to my mind the key word throughout the movie. Forrest Gump stumbles through world history (though only the United States are shown, but Hollywood usually supposes them to be the world so the movie has to be seen more in general than it's usual critics do) and what he sees makes only sense to a dim-whitted who doesn't let himself get stirred by events: Politicians are shot at(though no one elects better ones), Leutenants seek death in battle, \"running as fast as the wind\" is regarded as sufficient to get a collegue-degree and somebody who wants to change the world ends up in a terrible mess, having somehow missed the point. So we all do stupid often enough, society does and even America does like the rest of the world. Just Forrest doesn't.(Except towards Jenny, but that's a completely different thing, that's love.)He has only an IQ of 75 but he is the only one who behaves in a way we would like to expect from everyone (though we surely don't want them to talk like that). He has nothing to base his actions upon than his common sense and that shows us how far we've come apart from our ideal of rational behaviour.In the end one word to those who hated the film for Jenny's death of AIDS which they regarded as punishment,decreed by an reactionary movie: to my mind, Jenny's death is not ideology, it's tragedy, though it also conveys the basic idea of the movie. We won't get a better world by revolutions or drugs, we only achieve it if more people would do like Forrest, even when they have a higher IQ.",

This was even though he was working in Alabama at the same time when Forrest was growing up and it would be certainly more believable for Forrest to meet King than 90% percent of the celebrities he meets in his life.  I'm not asking him to meet Malcolm X, considering he was working in New York at the time.  Yet, King is ignored as if he didn't exist.Second, the cross country marathon screams of being tacked on.  I fail to see any humour in it and my eyes rolled how the media completely ignores in their reports that this \"mystery marathonner\" is an All American football player, a Congressional Medal of Honour recipient, a ping pong company spokesman and a millionaire owner of a fishing fleet.  You would figure this would make a lot of hay for any reporter writing this up about a man who can do all this and have a IQ of less than 75.",

Personally, I see that both Forrest Gump (FG) and TSR as the same standard of excellence. Both movies shows contrasting aspects of hope and how to adjust to injustices in the outside world. What made FG a classic and probably gave it the best picture Oscar was not only the special effects throughout the movie, or the brilliant appropriate use of music fitting the era, but the incredible acting and plot device. When I first saw FG I thought it was a good family comedy with immense amounts of surrealism. However after repeat viewing I realised that FG had one of the most thought provoking scripts ever committed to film. There are so many aspects of the storyline that has never left me ever since I saw the movie almost five years ago. Just like Life is Beautiful there is the external and internal images and story in this picture. The external is a family comedy that will make you laugh as many things seem so outrageous. However internally, FG is a movie about drug addiction, child sexual abuse, a true sacrificial love story with one way traffic, how a person can cope with disability without committing suicide, the nature of God when something terrible happens to you, prostitution and so much more besides. Tell me one other movie that can handle these subjects and still make you laugh throughout while telling you important moral lessons?Unlike other so called romance movies like Titanic, FG was not based on lust rather an understanding and fidelity of other persons' characters. If Forrest Gump is a bit dumb he makes up for it with his saint like character. What made this movie tragic is the long time span in which Forrest is in love with his girl and would do almost anything for her and yet she disrespects him because he is mentally disabled, he is not 'normal'. Yet the people Jenny hangs around with are spiritually and morally 'abnormal'. If people can't relate to this maybe it is beyond their understanding and comprehension as they have never been in that position.Forrest may not be able to verbalise the meaning of love, but his actions put 'normal' people to shame and some. Where else in a modern film do you see the hero being rejected by a gril or even genuinely wanting to get married, only in the old classics I suppose!! Forrest always has the hope of a better future, he teaches the audience that you should always have an aim to look forward to and that will help to keep you sane under misfortune, even if it's simply running down the road to owning a business. In addition, the movie shows that no matter what your disability you can still make a contribution to society and other people's lives. If this is not a powerful message I have never seen or heard one. Forrest knows that Jenny is the only girl he has got a chance with to be his wife, which makes the story even sadder as we see Jenny living a life on the edge. Even at the ending we are unsure whether Forrest is really looking after his son, but as long it is Jenny's and she is his,  he does not mind. Maybe this is a blind type of love, but he also loves Jenny like a biblical prodigal sister and he does not realise that he may have AIDS too. However FG gives hope to many millions of people around the world who are disabled and feel socially excluded in society. As the years roll by I still think about this movie which shows aspects of life which are heart wretchingly profound if you look beyond the external window. If this isn't a 10/10 movie I have not seen one.",

    "reviewTitle": "The greatest movie ever made - and why it won the Oscars!!!",
    "reviewBody": "A number of users have mentioned that The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) should have won the best picture Oscar over Forrest Gump (FG). This type of criticism is unjustified when you realise the various reason why FG actually won the Oscars!!! 1) The title Forrest Gump is a bit misleading as the movie is not really about FG as it first seems for the average viewer, rather it is about us the audience who are supposed to be normal but we act in real life even worse than FG. 2) FG is laughing at us as we laugh at him. We see him as abnormal, but when Forrest tries to understand us he finds out that normal people cause so much pain in the world towards other people. This is clearly shown with the short clips of political and social history throughout the movie which the viewing audience in the cinema failed to recognise. This helps to prove FG case against normal people. 3) The movie can be interpreted in so many different ways that every time a viewer watches it they get a different version of what Forrest sees and understands and what it means for human nature as a whole. Only Forrest seems normal in the movie, while others are killing pop stars and important people in society. Forrest can't understand why normal people do this, as for me personally I agree with Forrest on this issue. 4) While Forrest is telling his story of events in his life, many of the viewing audience thought it was literally happening, but because some of the events described are surreal in its feel many people thought the movie was silly. Yet it was the viewers who were silly as they see things through Forrest's eyes not their own. Equally the viewer misses many of the important aspects of the movies' message because they fail to go into Forrest's world and explore.Misinterpretation that the viewer makes: 1) The running scene though at first seeming stupid is in fact one of the most thought provoking scenes ever in the history of movie making, but the average viewer does not realise this, because he/she cannot think broadly. This scene shows that normal people are stupid to follow people in the media as icons thinking they are clever people because they seem to be doing something special. What Forrest shows is that famous people are just as brainy as every else. But we normal people worship politicians in vain and others stars to sort out our world problems. 2) When Forrest is speaking at a rally against Vietnam, again people in real life follow anybody who has a big mouth without really understanding what they are saying - so profound as well as funny. 3) Jenny only realises that Forrest is the right person for her when it is too late, you should not judge on appearances, rather the character.The Movie also shows how normal people bully others, rape and child abuse children, start wars, use people and discriminate others. Forrest does not do any of these things, yet we as the viewer call him abnormal. For me, this is the most innovative movie I have ever seen as it has duped the world to think it is about Forrest rather than themselves.",

    "reviewBody": "I've seen a great many movies, but when I saw \"Forrest Gump\", I was delighted.  I don't own it--I don't want to see it more than the two times I've seen it already, but this film was a valuable experience for me.It wasn't the best film of 1994 (that would be \"Pulp Fiction\"), the best directed (\"Natural Born Killers\"), or even the best written (\"Pulp...\", \"Clerks\", \"The Last Seduction\"), but there hasn't been a whole lot of movies that have been as emotionally rich or powerful as this one.  Robert Zemeckis has the power to exhaust me, whether it's my emotions (\"Contact\", this film), my visual cortex (\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"Contact\"), or my funny bone (\"Used Cars\").  His screenplay is responsible for anything positive that came out of Steven Spielberg's 1979 flop \"1941\", (except for that astonishing dance sequence).  Here he tops his past films and screenplays and has not done quite as good since then.I'll be honest:  sentimentality has its proper place and time, and must be done right.  This film has it.  I laughed and cried, and was struck dumb with awe.Its six Oscars meant that a few better films, performers, and technicians were robbed blind, but let's be real, folks:  they're Academy Awards.  It's a popularity contest, and as long as we see it for what it is, we can just sit back and enjoy them.  \"Forrest Gump\" wouldn't get any prizes from me, for the simple reason that any category would be won by another film.  But an Oscar?  Sure, what the heck.",

It's neat how they edit Tom Hanks in almost every major event from the 50's to the 80's. It's not really a movie about special effects but it manages to squeeze some in. I think what caught most people's eyes was that we understood Hanks. We could relate to his grief and rise to intelligence. For me, this will remain one of the greatest movies of all time. For others, sorry but you'll have to wait for another movie that touches your heart with gentle hands.",

With some films it's just best to sit back and enjoy the way it looks, and the way it makes you feel, this is one of them.",

This movie is also politically reactionary -- all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs, do drugs, beat their girlfriends, or die young.

    "reviewTitle": "Tom Hanks makes it work",
    "reviewBody": "Some of its critics say that \"Forrest Gump\" is little more than a right wing fable whose message is \"Vote Republican.\"  Yes, Forrest is the embodiment of \"traditional values,\" a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother, does what he's told, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed:  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what you're told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.  Once she settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with her.Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They maintain that \"Forrest Gump\" is simply a fable promoting such tried and true values as honoring your parents and your God.  It's the story of innocence uncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No matter how evil the times, goodness can prevail.I must say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do the arguments of those who champion the film.  It is with the latter group that I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since James Stewart has an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency. Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help you overlook the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" with John Lennon failed to convince).  I think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" but of all the people who took home Oscars for \"Forrest Gump,\" no one earned theirs more than Hanks.  I can't imagine another actor (a living one, anyway) taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he did.",

    "reviewBody": "A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's \"Zelig\", the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: \"S**t happens\". Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level,  \"Forrest Gump\" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous \"homage\") from such masterpieces as \"Midnight Cowboy\", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his \"stupid\" adventures.",

And the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. One thing that strikes me as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. Such as the filming of Bubba's ansectors and Lt. Dan's history of ansestors dying in wars. Even the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. These quick flashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and weren't even totally necessary to film, but they did anyway. That gives this movie an A for effort in my book.",

And, if you want to get picky about it, it's the only big blockbuster to make it onto the IMDB Top 250 in the past ten years, with the exception of \"Terminator 2\".  That just goes to show that it is not \"hype over content\".  Many people were turned off by the idea of a stupid person as the all-encompassing Everyman, but these were the same people who left the movie theater dry-eyed and continued on their very way, looking for advice from Madison Avenue, dumping their oh-so-liberal views on whoever would be genial enough to listen, and oh yes, condescendingly talking down to the local village idiot and then making fun of him behind his back.  Believe me, I have known people in my time described as \"village idiots\", and the personality with which Tom Hanks imbues Gump's character is dead-on accurate.  The film touched me in so many ways that my throat still lumps up every time the feather ascends to the sky with Alan Silvestri's BEAUTIFUL music playing in the background.  Zemeckis should be proud of himself for this one, which I think will go down as his masterpiece (and that's saying something from the man who made \"Back to the Future\" and \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\").  Forrest Gump may have been slow, but he was anything but a simpleton...those who denounce people like him and their naive worldview just envy the fact that their lives are built around a shimmering ideal brighter than all of the sexcapades and trivial pettiness of normality.  Oh yes, and for the person who commented on this film as \"The worst Best Picture Oscar winner of the 90s\"...obviously you haven't seen \"Shakespeare in Love\".",

The supporting actors deserve praise as well ( especially Gary Sinise).  The film editing was great as well.The movie itself did not move me like the Shawshank Redemption did ( both released in 1994).  The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award of the six Gump won).The story of a simpleton floating through life doesn't appeal to me. There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to want to create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and ground it solidly in realism, which just doesn't work.I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing. The other three should have gone to other films",

He sees beauty in its most natural form and only sees with his heart.  He seems to find himself meeting famous people but doesn't even know about it.  Gump just sees them as people.  He doesn't care if they're Elvis Presley or Lyndon B Johnson.  He sees through their fame and sees the people behind the face.  This movie can be summed up by a quote by William Shakespeare: Life is a tale Told by an idiot. And that is exactly what this movie has to offer.  Just remember to bring the tissues...",

    "reviewBody": "\"Forrest Gump\" is exactly the kind of film that has suffered from too much praise. As someone who genuinely loves this film, I am dumbfounded by those who hate it. But time after time, when a film receives high praise from a great number of people, it leaves high expectations for those who haven't seen it. The result is often disappointment.Some people object to its unrealistic approach. Suggesting that the involvement of Forrest in some of America's pivotal moments in history is not only ridiculous but misleading. Another argument I've heard is the fact that a mentally handicapped individual could never attain the levels of success that Forrest does. They've missed out on a truly charming, endearing fairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a simple one at that. And the dialogue is so inherently quotable, as the message behind it is so straightforward. \"Stupid is as stupid does\".Forrest is a purely innocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no fault found in him. It's the rest of the world that is realistic, impure, and flawed. And so, when Forrest hurts, we can't help but hurt for him, when he is successful, we can't help but be happy for him and when his heart breaks, ours breaks also.I can't tell if it's the music, the cinematography or the acting, but the scene where young Forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the bullies on bicycles, gets me every time. Every single time. I've watched this film more times than I care to count, as I feel as though I should be watching something I've never seen before. But this film just makes me feel good, and I'll no doubt watch it again.Now you see, I can't help but praise this film, and in a way I'm probably ruining it for someone else. My sister blames me for ruining it for her. It's not easy to forget what everyone's said, and the awards it has won. But if you haven't seen it already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and open your mind to a very charming film.",

The film shows how Forrest went through many important events, but the only thing he really wanted, Jenny, he couldn't have. This movie also shows that even though Forrest was slow, he had a lot of love in his heart. He wasn't intelligent, but he knew what love was.What Tom Hanks did in this movie is incredible. He made up a character that so unbelievable but is so realistic. He did an extraordinary acting job, and that is why I think he's the best actor.I think the best part of the movie is when Forrest stands next to Jenny's grave, and recites that speech. That part was wonderful. Especially when he says \"And our son, Forrest...He's just so smart Jenny. We go fishing together, we run together...\" It was great!",

Just the way that the film moves alone makes it great, you can toss out the story, performances and direction and Forrest Gump would still be miles ahead of the rest.Tom Hanks gives a great performance in the title role (although Morgan Freeman was probably more deserving in the Shawshank Redemption). Hanks portrays the man with an I.Q. of 75 like few actors could and maintains this throughout the film. Just the way that Forrest stumbles through all of the great U.S. events from the 50's to the 80's and thinks nothing of it is an accomplishment in itself.Zemekis did well making this film, just like the Back To The Future series. This film surely did not lack vision and all concepts are fresh and real for the time. Who would have ever thought that they could be placed in an interview with John Lennon? Well now thanks to Industrial Light and Magic, anyone can. Regardless what others may say about a weak or nonexistent ending, did the other 1994 favourite have one? Not really. This film is tied up about as well as possible with yet another coincedence.I haven't a bad thing to say about this film and fully recommend to all.9/10 stars.",

The dangerous thing about this movie is its sweeping generalizations and stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American history. Because the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to pull so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their revisionist version of the past few decades with little objection from the viewer.Yes, it's just a movie, but images like these shape the way people think. The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers, for example, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie. Using tiny, value-charged episodes to paint with such broad brush strokes, in settings that are designed to pull the viewer to Gump's side, is deceptive and manipulative.",

This is the sort of movie, like THE SOUND OF MUSIC, which cues its sentiment so strongly it's insulting.  It's interesting to take a movie like this and compare it with something like BIRDY (which has certain thematic similarities); BIRDY's premise is so much more far-fetched, and yet the movie has an authenticity GUMP can't manage.

    "reviewBody": "There are certain films that people should just enjoy.  Forrest Gump is one of them.  It makes you feel good.  It makes you feel happy and it makes you appreciate what excellent film making is all about.  Simply put, this movie is pretty much flawless and it is a movie for the ages.Pulp Fiction was deserving of best picture and so was Shawshank Redemption, but only one of these fine three films could have won that year.  It is like watching the two best hockey teams playing in the Stanley Cup Finals.  It is the seventh game and we are now in triple overtime and the score is tied at 2.  One team will win the cup, and not necessarily because they are better than the other, but because someone has to win.  That was the case in 1994. I loved Pulp, and I loved Shawshank, but I loved Gump too and when it won I cheered out loud.  Good for Robert Zemekis.What is so great about Forrest Gump is that it makes life a little more pure, a little more innocent.  Forrest never really quite understands what is going on around him and for that reason he lives life in the dark in some ways but in other ways, he sees so much more light than the rest of us. And his antics and the way he lives that life is an inspiration to the rest of us, or at least it should be.  And how can you not like the guy.  Is there a more likable character in the history of cinema?  I doubt it!Robert Zemekis took me completely by storm when I first saw this film. Back To The Future was a great film and he has always shown that he has a propensity for box office gold, but to make a picture that was not only phenomenally successful at the box office but is this sweet and fun and heart warming, was not what I expected from him.  Then again, he is a Spielberg cronie, so that must mean something.Zemekis is one of the strengths of this film, but the tour de force is really Hanks.  His adaptation of the character is remarkable.  He is ever so convincing and even though his work in Philedelphia was completely Oscar worthy, this is even a step above that.  I love him here and I will see anything that he is in from here on out.I love movies.  I love what they do to me.  I love that they can make me feel a plethora of emotions.  Even when I despise a film, I can still look back and say that if anything it made me feel something.  But Forrest Gump is a microcosm of why I like movies.  My world is little better after I watch this movie and for that I am so glad that this film was made.  And for the people that can't enjoy this movie, I certainly hope that in the years to come you can.  Because you just don't know what you're missing.",

He was arguing from a 'moral' (read 'conventional Western family-oriented' standpoint) but his argument also had a bearing on the bottom line. He reckoned that more 'nice' films would encourage more people back into the cinemas.Forrest Gump would appear to be the realisation of Medved's dream, to the extent that the movie also praises the virtue he left off the list, namely abject stupidity. Because that's what MM and his cronies really want, isn't it? Movies that don't challenge, don't irritate, don't ask awkward questions. Movies with no toilets (see Pleasantville), movies that operate on the assumption that a fortune-cookie-spouting dullard who loves his mom is some kind of embodiment of the American dream.Wake up, America. You managed to elect one Hollywood simpleton with a tenuous acquaintance to reality. Now you make movies about them. In the words of the greatest American philosopher, D'OH!This is a dumb movie, made by clever, cynical people, for other people who want to feel all warm and fuzzy and not worry about the fact that they lost all form of intellectual discrimination the day they took out that subscription to Reader's Digest.

The pop singer Prince once had a line in a song \"Life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last!\".From the passing of Forrest's mother to Bubba to Jenny Forrest outlived them all and was somehow a better person, a more complete human being for the experience.10/10 for a movie with heart.PS  The gunfire and napalm scenes in the jungle were brilliant!",

    "reviewBody": "The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'.  ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably `Quiz Show').  Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'.  I took this as a deep personal affront.  I took every undeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront.  It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just too stupid to succeed for very long.  Ah, well.  Life imitates art.Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue.  Gump is as innocent as they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing.  The trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply.  He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going on.  (If only a bomb had landed on his foot.  It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.",

    "reviewTitle": "Shallow, frequently offensive movie somewhat redeemed by Hanks and Sinise",
    "reviewBody": "FORREST GUMP is a vaguely picaresque story of a mentally retarded but good-hearted fellow who grows up during the 1960s and 1970s, serving in the Vietnam conflict, running a shrimping trawler, and pursuing a very unlovable childhood sweetheart.  He has no control over his life, but is not smart enough to realize it or care.  Gary Sinise co-stars as Lt. Dan Taylor, Gump's ex-C.O. who follows him around after the war like an albatross hung around his neck.It's been five years since I saw this movie, but I still remember how it annoyed me, chiefly by appealing to the basest, most jaded parts of the viewers' personalities.  The worst instance was when Forrest Gump tells the audience that his sweetheart Jenny's father loves her a lot, always hugging and kissing her.  In my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker rippled through the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement that Jenny's father is sexually abusing her, and Zemeckis later confirms this leap to a sick conclusion.  It is a truly sad commentary both on the entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very concept of fatherhood today is so disrespected that for a father to hug and kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse.Jenny's character is so despicable that Gump's love for her is inexplicable. Perhaps it is intended as an example of really \"unconditional\" love, and shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who clings to an abusive husband no matter what he does to her.  Her character hits rock bottom when, having abandoned Gump like a used-up tissue and taken his child from him without even informing him, Jenny refuses even to apologize to him because she was \"messed up.\"  Gump swallows this excuse with stomach-turning ease.Now I don't want to launch into some Pat-Robertson-like tirade on the decline of American morality.  American morality is better today than in the past in many ways.  Racial hatred has gone from being an accepted norm to being absolutely intolerable.  Rape is blamed on the victim less frequently than in bygone days.  Sexual double standards are being abandoned. Religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the upswing.  But in some other ways, American morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, \"I was messed up,\" is perhaps the best example.  Every kind of barbarism, from Jenny's cruel and heartless manipulation of Gump up to and including cold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase \"I was messed up,\" followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoer's misfortunes.  FORREST GUMP wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers' moral thought.  I'm not buying into it.  Being \"messed up\" may excuse viciousness against the person who messed you up; it should never be allowed to justify hurting innocent people.The movie's exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is also tasteless and vulgar (and yes, I will shamefacedly admit, I laughed at some of this exploitation).  I may not want a mental deficient like Gump for an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic decency and courtesy, which this movie doesn't; (i.e. where Gump, shaking Richard Nixon's hand, says \"I gotta pee.\"  This is funny?).The mitigating, if not the saving, virtue of FORREST GUMP is the acting. Tom Hanks' rendition of a speech impediment might not fool the parent of a mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly convinced me and the average moviegoer.  Hanks generates the innocence and pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my nerves a few times, it was bearable.  Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor is absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and cynicism from every pore.I also give FORREST GUMP some grudging praise for being one of the few movies to use the wonders of modern digital special effects to actually drive the plot, rather than distract from it.  TITANIC and JURASSIC PARK also broke some ground, but for the most part I think that most directors lack the imagination to get the most out of the potential of modern special effects.  Zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly than most directors have.I didn't really hate FORREST GUMP.  It obviously wants to be loved so much that hating it would be like kicking an annoying puppy.  But it's morally obtuse, shallow and vulgar.  The laughs are guilty laughs, and the philosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that God does indeed look after fools.Rating: ** out of ****.",

    "reviewTitle": "Suffers from directorial influence",
    "reviewBody": "The best thing in this movie is Gary Sinise. He growls, smirks, and spits his way through a terrific performance before his character is converted to Forrest's religion. Other than that, there's not much meat in this movie. I thought Hanks was pretty good as Gump, but it's not a role that you can screw up too badly because there's very little character to slip into.\nThe biggest problem with it is the artificial, plastic directing job, something that other Zamekis productions suffer from also. The sequence of dying Lt. Dan ancestors is particularly egregious - it's supposed to be funny, I think, but doesn't quite make it. I'm also at a loss to explain why we needed the Gump within a Gump voiceover narration. It only adds to the syrupy tone with the kind of pseudo-humor you see in many TV commercials. This story could have told itself quite well without this and similar directorial tricks.I was a little bit bothered by the right-wing sensibilities present, but not all that much. I'm used to the co-opting of counter-culture product to prove alternate ideals (like the idea behind John Lennon's \"Imagine\"). Using a false history as a dramatic device is OK with me, just do something interesting with it. Hollywood has a tendency to de-legitimize creativity as merely the accident of situation. Zamekis has done this before in Back to the Future, where Chuck Berry supposedly gets his inspiration for \"Johnny B. Good\" from one performance (instead of years of hard work). I hate it when this is used for a joke - and not a very good one, usually. Just like many things in this movie, it's pandering to the nostalgia of the audience. Similar things are done to Bear Bryant. But I digress.The best scene in the movie is when Hanks sees Sinise at the dock and runs into the water to greet him. It sums up both characters beautifully. And despite (or maybe because of) the heavy borrowing from other movies, other good scenes are the barroom scene with Hanks and Sinise, the orgasm scene, and the initial meeting of Hanks and his Drill Sergeant. I mention these because they don't typify the piled-on heavy sentiment that the rest of the movie employs.",

    "reviewTitle": "Going trough the motions",
    "reviewBody": "The first time I saw Forrest Gump, I loved it. On the second time around, I saw how terrible it actually is. There is not as much a plot as an idea. It's like watching \"Look who's talking\", where the writers thought that simply having a baby talk was plot enough to fill a hour and a half.You all know the premise of this movie. The life of a retarded man in 20th century America. He does a lot of unusual things, which all turn out ok and trigger key historical events. This is funny. Then the writers see that two hours have passed, and have to conjure an ending. They kill off Forrest's wife and have Forrest give a tearjerking speech like only Tom Hanks can. This is uplifting. There. Now go home and feel good.Some of my friends saw the film as plain all-american propaganda. In my opinion however, the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough to just be a vehicle for the American dream. In fact, Forrest Gump could have been a biting satire. As the audience is clearly supposed to laugh at Forrest's improbable success, the film could be seen as a parody. Mostly all the humour comes from the fact that the audience knows that the events are the exact opposite of what would happen in reality. The filmmakers could even have argued that recent history is so insane, that the events could as well have been caused by someone like Mr. Gump. The movie, however, doesn't have the guts to have lean to the right or left. Forrest's pivotal role in history is treated as a mere light-hearted gimmick, omitting all the possibilities for actual commentary.The film tries to have it both ways in many other scenes as well. Apparently it´s not PC to bully Forrest, but on the other hand the audience is supposed to laugh at his antics. Forrest as both a war hero and a peace advocate exemplifies this problem. This isn't being ironic, impartial or open to interpretation. Especially concerning the Vietnam war, the writers have obviously not wanted to offend anyone, now matter how derivative it will look. In the end, it only comes off as having nothing to say.",

    "reviewTitle": "The script is brilliant!",
    "reviewBody": "\"Forrest Gump\" Tom Hanks ( Sleepless in Seattle) is one of my favorite characters in all the movies that I have ever seen. That covers a lot of movies.  Every time I watch the movie,  I start talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump. His transparency, his sincerity, his naivete, his sense of commitment toward his friends is beyond what anyone could imagine. We watched the movie again when we were visiting relatives for Thanksgiving. Uncle Gene was cracking up. He is a WWII veteran.  He loved that line: \"I got a million dollars wound but so far I have not seen one cent of it!\" After two days of talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump,  my husband looked at me and said: \"now you sound like Katharine Hepburn.\" I think that one the reasons that I adore and understand Forrest is because he \"lived\" through my years as a young adult. The script is brilliant! Clever, clever, clever! The movie touches everyone. The older folks, because they lived through it as adults; baby bloomers because they lived through it as young adults; even the kids in my neighborhood will scream: \" run,  Forrest, run.\" Every time they see someone running. My favorite quote: Bubba Blue, Mykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) said: \"Anyway, like I was saying', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.\". My favorite scenes: Forrest showing his buttocks to the President. When he sees \"Jeannie\" (Message in the Bottle) in Washington, D.C., they meet at the pool of the ellipse. They were again briefly like peas and carrots! Forrest sees \"Lieutenant Dan\" Gary Senise (Apollo 13), he jumps into the ocean and his boat crashes! The little feather that flies at the beginning and end of movie. The music is great! This is one of the best movies ever made and that is all I have to say about that!",

    "reviewTitle": "Classic Film!",
    "reviewBody": "Spoilers!First, it was a classic film, which should have won all the awards it did. Second - it could have been better.Gump is a tall tale, a cliched tour, of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. One man, a slightly retarded individual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and/or is the cause of innumerable public events and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood Mac. It's a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back t-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - except:Except that as with any tall tale, the how, why, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized events, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (it's a slow point of the film). It's a joke, here, pathos there. It's a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and boring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black man - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington crowd - 'offing the pigs' while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set - bunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar were heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But it's not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as it remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which would seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.The pathos is suggested in Gump as the 'little child' of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the like. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dan's life, and presents the most emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny - and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.However, Gump isn't really a child. A while his acceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesn't know enough not to be naive. He doesn't have a choice - and it's not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is really a series of screenwriter's jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what he's done, or why. It's all a blur of events which he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. It's only to contradict the story so far when running man, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in Vietnam. It's like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one seen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset over a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple man more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.Ultimately, it could be the writers present a message they didn't intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even in desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that life is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that life is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature, friends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even to be pitied for it. It's a message film, to be sure. But the message can get lost in the humorous tall tale, because in that sense, it's almost two films, instead of one.",

    "reviewTitle": "Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar!",
    "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this movie.  It made me laugh and cry, but it also made me think.  Forrest might have a low IQ, but yet, he smarter than most people I know.  He knows it's not right for Jenny's boyfriend to hit her.  He's also very loyal.  Even though Lieutenant Dan gives Forrest a hard time, Forrest always stays his friend.  He also keeps his promise to Bubba, by starting the shrimp business.  Finally, he's always loyal to Jenny, the love of his life.  She changes with the times, but Forrest always waits for her.  Also, when Forrest goes to visit her grave, he leaves the note that young Forrest wrote to her.  He told his dad not to open it, so he didn't.  That too shows that Forrest keeps his promises.Just when I thought that Tom Hanks's performance in \"Philadelphia\" was his best, he comes out with Forrest Gump.  He is one of the best actors today, if not the best.  \"Forrest Gump\" is a movie you'll want to see again and again...it's a masterpiece!",

    "reviewBody": "The moment I saw that Tom Hanks made a movie called Forrest Gump, I knew it was about some person's life, as all movies whose names are the name of a person.But there was something different about Forrest Gump... This shocked me a lot, it was just different than other movies, and I could not figure out why.There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best performance. (In my opinion..) I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was simply spectacular.This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest, and you don't want anything bad to happen to him, and you feel good when he does something right, or when he gets good things, even by luck.It also had a bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were funnier than the whole Austin Powers movie).Forrest Gump really got into me.. It's a feeling that is a little hard to explain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention you'll probably find out how good this movie is, and how real things are.. This movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is someone out there just like Forrest Gump.When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the best Actor and best Movie awards.This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are rated higher than this.",

    "reviewTitle": "The biggest thief I've ever seen.",
    "reviewBody": "I know my one line summary might not be that clear so I'm going to explain it to you.  In  1994, we had classics like \"The Shawshank redemption\" and \"Pulp fiction\" who were in nomination at the Oscars and were stolen in every category in which they were nominated.  They were all stolen by \"Forrest Gump\".  These two other movies which were completely different in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked.  And the worst part is \"Forrest Gump\" is simply the biography of Forest Gump.  Also, it robbed every movie in the best actor category.  Of course it isn't that easy to play someone who is mentally ill but it's easier than playing just some ordinary person and playing it well.  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) lives with his mother and comes from North-West Alabama.  However, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for which he must wear a brace.  When he starts going to school, he is rejected by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named Jenny.  One day after school, while Forrest and jenny are hanging together, they are surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks at Forrest.  He tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get away.  This is the classic scene when Jenny yells \"Run Forrest, run.\" and as he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are unable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have bikes.  As the years pass, Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) go their own way. Forrest gets into the army and goes to Vietnam.  But one night in the camp, all the soldiers are in bed and pass on a Playboy magazine.  When Forrest gets it, he realizes Jenny has her photograph in it.  Further on during the war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named Don Taylor (Gary Sinise) but loses his best friend Bubba.  Also, his lieutenant is left legless because of the accident whereas the only Forrest gets is a bullet in the butt.  When Forrest gets home, he as many things to do.  On of them is to go over to Bubba's parents' house to announce to them he was killed in combat.  Another thing he does is try to find Jenny.  The movie is a kind of comedy-drama and is pretty good.  But I still don't think nor understand how it won best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks) and best director (Robert Zemeckis) at the Oscars. I mean, if it had really deserved those Oscars, wouldn't it get a higher rank than both \"Pulp fiction\" and \"The Shawshank redemption\" on our top 250 list?  I actually believe that the one who deserved an Oscar more than anyone else in the movie is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Don Taylor.  However, it was almost impossible for him to win that year because we had Martin Landau in nomination for best supporting actor in \"Ed Wood\" and he truly deserved the Oscar he won.  So all in all, this isn't a bad movie, it's just way too over-rated.",

    "reviewTitle": "At Times Fascinating and Informative but Also Considerably Offensive",
    "reviewBody": "Perhaps the most interesting aspect in Forrest Gump is its various alternations of certain historical events.  While these scenes (presented in the fashion of archives) which center on interaction with numerous past famous people essentially appears to be contrived (not to mention that the film also could have gone further with the satire), this can also serve as some type of source for information on the United States and are amusing and inventive. The storytelling in general, feels like a way to provide some type of information and history of the United States at a certain period. But the film as a whole feels bloated, and along the way, some considerably offensive material can be found here and there.  At one point, there's a feeling that the script is trying to lay down a stereotype people based on the type of states that they live in.  The script in certain areas takes some humor and/or tries to create satire out of people with various physical disabilities along with seemingly attempting to create some humor out of a racial slur based on misinterpretation from the title character.  Certain points in the story are brought up in a relatively low key fashion but we still can help to come to a foregone conclusion on the meaning of the particular topics that are discussed.  Along with that, Forrest Gump occasionally aims for absolutely low brow humor rather than providing more necessary satire.  While the musical score makes for a good set piece, the drama to a certain extent can also rub you the wrong way.  It at times breaks down and treads into sappy territory and can also get pretty manipulative.  Take for instance a small reference to AIDS which by itself feels tagged onto the story.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is a fairy tale, and its review of US history is oversimplified at best. But because the movie does not claim realism, these things don't bother me the way they normally do. The movie is light and mostly funny while you watch it, but what sticks is much deeper. It is a modern version of a classic literary theme: the idiot who is thereby wiser than the rest of us.  Forrest is too dumb to hate blacks.  He is too dumb not to keep his promises and give away his money. He is too dumb not to save Lt. Dan, twice, once in battle and later, through continued good will and positive attitude, from himself.  He is too dumb to give up on his hopeless love. One is left inspired by this modern morality play, inspired to try to be a little better person, in hopes that in real life goodness might have just a bit of the effects it has in this movie.I watched this movie with my kids, ages 10 and 13. It was more explicit than I expected for a PG-13, and halfway through I wondered if I had made a mistake showing it to them. But no, it was a very good movie for them, for the reasons discussed above.  Also for another reason: their knowledge of the times of the movie was limited, and their questions from the movie led to several good discussions.",

    "reviewBody": "'Forrest Gump' was an inoffensive and entertaining enough movie without being spectacular cinema. However, my comments concern one (possibly two) odd aspects of the moviePresident Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others except Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it turns out Forrest's actions were pivotal in the downfall of Nixon.There's another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is depicted watching American bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976, presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea 'for no particular reason'. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the assassination attempt on Reagan, from memory. This means that Forrest was running (remember, 'for no particular reason') for just about exactly the duration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest never met President Carter. Is this some sort of comment on the Carter administration (perhaps that America lost it's way under Carter - a dubious proposition at best) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same landscape featured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album. I don't think there's any sub text here, except that it's quite a remarkable landscape",

It's a fictious character and a fictious plot, but if I haven't known that, I would have said that I believe that the film is based on a true story with a few adaptions and plot point changes. Eventhough Forrest goes through the most unplausible situations one can go through.I doubt that anyone will observe life the same way after seeing this movie. A lot of them will say that the movie was stupid and overdone, but deep inside they'll remember it forever. The promotional tagline of the movie truly is the point of it and its message. That's what the creators accomplished, and in such an unexpected and unique way that you really start to wonder was the quality of this movie maybe reached by a complete accident. The tagline and the feather prove that it wasn't.I find `Forrest Gump' original, intelligent, wise, sly, balanced, complex, heartwarming, unbelievably dynamic, witty in one-of-a-kind manner, endlessly touching and enchanting, extraordinary and magical. And, for that matter, one of the best American motion pictures in the history of filmmaking.",

This movie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they too, without doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a \"success\" without trying.

Mykelti Williamson is memerable as Gumps kind of lugish friend Bubba. And Sally Field is great like always.Although this film is through the eyes of a very simple man, it is about a big question. Do we all have a destiny in life or are we all just floating like a feather on a breeze? Gump tries to find this out but all he finds out the only things important in life is the love of true friends, and family. Nothing else matters. Not awards from presidents, being a football star, or being a shrimping tycoon. Only being in the arms of your true love.This movie is superb in every way.

Let's face it, this guy Gump knew everyone, met everyone, and did everything, and there are pictures to prove it. He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a \"dull normal\" in IQ terms? He triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow, plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual. You will win in this technologically cut-throat world-wide competitive market by being nice. The meek will inherit the earth. Take that Bill Gates!",

    "reviewTitle": "The most ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life",
    "reviewBody": "OK, before I tear this movie to shreds, exactly HOW many Academy Awards did the stupid thing win? No, wait, don't tell me. I have a feeling the answer will depress me.This hype--er, movie--is a living testament to the fact that the baby boomers are incredible suckers. It's quite simple, really. You make a movie that romanticizes the '50's, '60's and '70's, and with enough publicity and a good enough soundtrack, no matter how bad the movie is, you have a hit on your hands. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the generation is stupid or shallow by any means; I'm merely saying that perhaps the haze of nostalgia that obstructed their view of the movie screen during Forrest Gump is what made this trash a hit.Because Forrest Gump is one ridiculous, unbelievable joke followed by another, and when Forrest isn't teaching Elvis how to dance, giving Lennon the idea for \"Imagine\" or, in an embarrassing scene I only WISH I could call \"forgettable\", wiping his face on a clean shirt and making a smiley face with the dirt by accident (\"Have a nice day,\" he says to the man who gave him the shirt, thankfully ending one of the \"clever\" scenes that surely had everyone rolling in the aisles); his life is taking another depressing turn that makes this less \"feel-good movie of 1994\" than \"number 1 movie of 1994 to commit suicide to\". He's born crippled with an IQ of 75; the neighborhood kids taunt and throw rocks at him; his \"girlfriend\" Jenny leads him on hopelessly while sleeping with every man in America except for him; his best friend dies in Vietnam and his superior has his legs blown off. Feelin' good yet? Oh, it gets better.But even if Forrest Gump IS depressing, that doesn't make it a bad movie. What makes it bad is, as I said before, the silliness. Sure, putting him in all those vintage newsreels is cute and even pretty cool to see. But the cuteness wears thin pretty soon, and is replaced by more ridiculous events in which Forrest inadverently alters NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICA, FOR THREE ENTIRE DECADES. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but not for me. For me, it makes the movie completely unbelievable, and what's more, stupid. This is not cute, and I certainly wasn't feeling good when I realized I'd wasted over two hours of my life listening to Forrest Gump's preposterous anecdotes.In the end, the movie's few saving graces--the good but predictable soundtrack (\"For What it's Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield in a Vietnam scene...great! Only 300 other movies before have done the exact same thing!), and the interesting effects with the newsreels--fail to rescue this bomb from the clutches of mediocrity. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can have Oscars coming out of their friggin' ears, for all I care...this movie will only ever amount to a 5 out of 10 in my book.",

    "reviewTitle": "Tom Hanks and Amazing Special Effects",
    "reviewBody": "\"Forrest Gump\" dominated 1994.  The film was a box office smash and won six Academy Awards.  Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated performance).  Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual effects and editing techniques.  \"Forrest Gump\" is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.  The cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later.  Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that was hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of \"Schindler's List\", may be the best and most important film of the 1990s.  The fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" just adds to the greatness of this outstanding motion picture.  5 stars out of 5.",

After viewing the movie again, I remember what a real tour de force this role was for Hanks. He was fantastic here, and the whole film remains extremely entertaining. When you've seen it before, you don't concentrate so much on the special effects putting Hanks into historical footage. Some of those effects were better than others, but it was a really cute trick. The best effects, however were the computer removal of Gary Sinise's legs. I watched closely and this was absolutely seamless, looked perfect on the screen. Robin Wright also deserves mention for a great performance, as does Sinise and Sally Fields.",

Well, it's to be rectified.Forrest Gump was an absolute favorite of mine for several years, it still ranks among the top ten movies of all time. It is brilliant, a true gem that will undoubtedly become a classic. It already IS a classic, actually. At least in my book.Though it differs from the book - or should I say it has nothing to do with the book by Winston Groom at all except for the name Forrest Gump and ping-pong - it has an almost literary quality to it: it's the kind of epic and insane saga one can find in one. The life and adventures of Forrest Gump are a modern equivalent of Munchausen, but this time around, the liar tells the truth. Forrest Gump is a perfect human being, a bit on the slow side, I'll admit - but he is honest, he is righteous and he never wants to do anyone any harm.This film is also a meandering look at modern American history, it's politics and society, and the distance that Forrest himself sets between the events and actually understanding them is the kind of distance we all feel sometimes - or want to feel more often. His ability to walk away unscathed from any happening is one I sure would like to have.I short put, this film is one I will remember for the rest of my life.",

And the story he reflects is of America and its journey through the late 20th century, its failings and its growth. It isn't a totally glorious story.  Nor is it the story of wealthy, clever people (and their shrinks) from the cities - that's for the Woody Allens of the world, and their admittedly important and valuable studies of interior worlds.  This is an expansive survey of what makes America what it is.  Zemeckis's answer is the nearest thing to Frank Capra's deeply democratic concept of America as a collection of ordinary, not-too-bright, people who are sometimes misled by their \"leaders\", sometimes beguiled into temptation, who make mistakes but collectively stumble and fumble to a generally benign destination guided by wisdom and good intentions that few of them possess consistently as individuals but which comprise the collective sum of their histories. Tom Hanks must be a genius to play the Everyman, Mr America.  It seemed to be the role Dennis Weaver was destined for after Duel; it's the role Dennis Hopper achieved once in Easy Rider; it's the role Gary Cooper and James Stewart filled in Capra's films; but none of them had to carry quite so much of a film as Hanks does here.",

    "reviewBody": "Six years have passed since we first saw Forrest Gump. At first is was highly praised and has since slowly died off. I believe that ten years from now, Forrest Gump will be regarded as an American classic.  The last time I watched \"Gump\" was about three years ago and it was wearing thin. Having watched it so many times, it began to loose its punch. You realize that it is VERY fictional and that it is not nearly as good as 1994's Best-Picture runner-up Pulp Fiction. But, having watched it recently I was able to enjoy it again, more than I did the first time, because of the great performances by all, and the unforgettable moments.  Forrest Gump is destined to become a classic due to its great, heart-warming story, and classic lines that will be repeated like those from Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, and other favorites. The main reason though, is that Forrest Gump is a lesson in 1900's American history. The sixties were a crazy-ass time, and I'm glad I didn't have to live in them(I'm only 20). Politicians being assassinated, Vietnam, drugs, and the Cold War all depicted in their actual footage. Actual broadcasts of Nixon's resignation, the Apollo landing, and newscasts of politicians such as Ford, Reagan, and Gov. Gorge Wallace. \"Gump\" is a great movie. One that WILL be appreciated even more through time.",

Jeez, it's shameless.\nNO WAY this is better than Shawshank! Morgan Freeman's performance both breaks my heart and fills me with hope (pretty much what Hanks tried and failed to do - and he won the friggin' Oscar).

Forrest Gump is heart-warming and spiritually uplifting in another words .Technically , Forrest Gump is a perfect motion picture . The cinematography , the music score and script are ones of the best , if not the best . And the special effect and sound are the best I have seen . Immaculately done computer generated graphics are totally genuinely looking and even unbelievable today . It deserved all the 13 nominations it garnered although it got only six as it competed with many strong entries in technical fields ( musical , art direction , cinematography and etc ) .I totally hate Pulp Fiction which many people here prefer over Forrest Gump because it's such a pointlessly violent film which makes foul language sound cool . The Shawsank Redemption is a fine film but not as great as many people have claimed . In any light , Forrest Gump is a classic , a box office success ,  award recognizing film that has a place in American Film Institute Top 100 films of all time .",

Forrest Gump is a good movie but it isn't in the same league as TSR or PF. Will the academy ever apologise for this mistake and many others? I think they should.Tom Hanks was good, but the real winner was Morgan Freeman. Robert Zemeckis did a great job, but what Quentin did.....WOW. Forrest Gump is a wonderful film, but in this year against Pulp and esp. Shawshank it shouldn't have won.This (Forrest Gump) is a great indication that the academy awards don't always get it right, this comes mainly through the hype which surround some movies therefore maybe the oscars should  be held a year later when the hype is gone. (Titanic vs. L.A. Confidential another example) Then the real winners will win hopefully.1994 was a great year but the academy got all the main oscars wrong (best actress was Natalie Portman for Leon), what a shame.Nevertheless my rating for Forrest Gump is 8/10",

    "reviewTitle": "2 points regarding the power of this film",
    "reviewBody": "I want to make two observations that I have not seen in the over 160 reviews of this film that I just read on this site.1)  One thing that Forrest does not embody, something which our culture is drowning in, is sarcasm.  (For accessible examples, read many of the reviews for this film!)  That is one of the reasons people find it surprisingly moving.  If you watch a lot of popular movies, not to mention sitcom TV, you might think that sarcasm is the natural idiom of communication.  But then, when someone actually asserts something and takes a stand for something (other than self-seeking sex or egotistical domination) without a whiff of sarcasm, the effect can be stunning.We have forgotten that sarcasm is parasitic on somebody actually asserting something.  To cut through the garbage of life we should be able to distance ourselves from the false parts of it, and that is what sarcasm does.  But sarcasm cannot assert anything except its derision of someone else's assertion.  It is derivative and parasitic.  To see someone who is without sarcasm, as we see in Gump, can be an eye-opening and truly moving experience, opening us to a vision of life where there is something to believe in, and not just something to mock.This is not a question of Gump's (low) intelligence, though our culture often likes to think that sarcasm is the sine qua non of intelligence.  It is about a desire to commit and risk.  Sarcasm falls silent in the face of life honestly lived in adherence to values worth striving after.  Hence, all we are left with are tears when we see someone without sarcasm and guile who lives a life of loyalty and love.2) The recitation of recent history may seem a frivolous excuse for a few jokes, but the whole point of it detonates in the penultimate scene where Forrest talks to Jenny's grave.  He asks \"Is it Lieutenant Dan who is right, or is it Momma?\" (or words to that effect).  He is asking if we are all fated in a predeterministic way or if we are truly free to make our own destiny.  His answer--\"I think its both\"--rings true for many people, and hence is a powerful comment on all of life.  Both the capriciousness of history and a sense of something coming from it are acknowledged, and that speaks to me.The feather seems to be blown around randomly, but it comes to rest in strategic places.  God's grace works within the context of our human freedom, and, in the end, this is a film about grace.",

    "reviewBody": "After all the hype surrounding this movie and its subsequent showing at the Oscars, i thought i knew enough about this movie to know it wasn't going to be my type of flick. \"..feel-good fodder for the dumbed down American masses...simple boy leads extraordinary life in an over-simplified excursion thru post war America.... over-hyped, over-rewarded.. lacking realism and believable characters.\"that would have been some thing like the review i might have given prior to watching this film.having now seen the film ( thru a rather sad of anything else to do on Saturday night)i would not change much about what i've already said about the film except to say , if possible it was even worse than i feared.Not once did i feel any pathos for Gump. his low IQ was mainly used as a convenient plot device to explain all the unbelievable things that happened to him. Who can believe a guy who runs across America for 3 years just because he felt like it all of a sudden? If all the things that happen to Gump really happend to one person, that person would be a national celebrity if not an icon. Yet Gump seems to end the movie as a relatively anonymous character. Some might say this adds to the charm of the story, that this guy could be involved in all these extraordinary happenings without really knowing the consequences of his actions and what was going on around him. I think this merely adds to the flawed nature of the film. SPOILER ALERT Having said all of this, the movie maybe has one redeeming feature.My girlfriend was in tears by the end when Jenny dies. Maybe this works as a love story.  But i wouldnt watch this film just on that basis. In fact i won't ever watch this film again unless someone offers me a serious amount of money, which lets face it is about as realistic as most of this movie!",

As a native southerner, I'm sensitive to 'South/Idiot' allusions in popular media, and instinctively braced myself for either sentimentality or stupidity as that feather began its gorgeous journey.

Driving Miss Daisy, Dances With Wolves, Chariots of Fire and Titanic were all Best Picture winners, and if you ask me were all given too much credit. In the future, no one will remember FORREST GUMP.

    "reviewTitle": "Not worthy",
    "reviewBody": "I am surprised that `Forrest Gump' made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together.When I first saw the film, I didn't understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some places. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 IQ. I'm no expert, but I don't see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. This is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on TV.I'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film `Being There', Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler. However, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.Next up on the docket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I don't like heavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon' or `Apocalypse Now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As for the aftermath, Lieutenant Dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voight's character in `Coming Home' that I would sue for copyright infringement.The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan. Robin Wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the film's Best Picture Oscar, I can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction'.`Forrest Gump' has highlights however. The bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you.Make your own decision, I'm playing it safe with a 5/10.",

But through all these things that you could that would make this sound like an awful movie, there is one thing that you cannot deny.  This movie moved people.  Told from the naive and Simple-minded Gump, it trawls through Vietnam, the US Hippy Age, and numerous events at the Whitehouse, showing that Gump has had a far more interesting life  than he would ever let on.  It is essentially a love story, as he continues in his mission to win over his childhood sweet heart.  It is told completely in flash back until the last few minutes, and as a brilliant Tom Hanks unravels the story for his audience, delivering line after line of unknowing yet amazingly poignant statements, you sort of realise just how good it was to be totally ignorant things.  Maybe this movie was not as great as everyone said it was. In realisation, it did not deserve the heap of Oscars it got.  But for two hours, this innocent guy reminded us what it was like to be youthful in mind, totally free of cynicism. And I for one, have got no problem whatsoever with that. *****",

    "reviewTitle": "A remarkable adventure",
    "reviewBody": "I have seen this masterpiece several times, and I can honestly say there is no other film quite like it. The plot is now familiar to all - Tom Hanks plays a man with a lower-than-average IQ whose life becomes intertwined with the major events and people of recent U.S. history.In the film he: - inspires Elvis how to swivel his hips - see Governor George Wallace attempt to stop high school integration - becomes a phenomenal college football player - fights in the Vietnam war and rescues several soldiers - speaks at a huge anti-war rally - becomes a millionaire philanthropist through shrimp fishing and wise investments - witnesses the Watergate break in - runs across America several times - meets John Lennon - creates several well known sayings - becomes a ping-pong champion and travels to China to compete - meets three U.S. presidentsWhat's fascinating is that as amazing as these accomplishments sound, they really don't mean very much to Gump. His only need is just to be with his life-long sweetheart Jenny. His pursuit and ultimate winning over of her is really all that matters to him. It is the execution of this simply story against the vast events of history that makes this film absolute magic.Everything about this film works, and works well. The cinematography, the music, the script, direction, and of course, the acting. The special effects in this film are also remarkable, but they are used fairly sparingly, and act more as a supplement to the story, rather than becoming the story itself, as in many other films. Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors, and this film will probably be remembered as his magnum opus.10/10",

    "reviewBody": "OK, unlike some of you, I am not going to slam this film out of anger just because it beat out \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" on the 1994 awards circuit.  Yes, this film was made with broad eyes and simple minds.  Yes, it partially served as a candy-coated time capsule for those narcissistic baby boomers.  Yes, as usual, the film is loaded with Zemekis' right-wing ideals clumsily disguised as cuddly Hallmark Card sentiments. One thing that may have bothered people is how American this film is.  It is SO American, so much so that I ask you to think of a recent film that is so American that isn't completely set in some military environment. Nonetheless, I loved the epic scope and reach of this film.  It restored my belief that people still want to make \"magical\" films.  The breadth of this film is as close to an old MGM musical as we're going to get these days.I don't think Tom Hanks was playing over-the-top (that endeavor belongs to Al Pacino), he hit the note just right with his mix of innocence and morality.  Gary Sinise got damn lucky with this film.  Like Richard Gere, Sinise suffers from the John Travolta syndrome; they're all good actors who have a habit of picking bad movies.  But Sinise must have known how juicy this role was, his poker-face reaction to the New Year's party is just incredible.  Robin Wright-Penn also gave a great performance, and you have to give credit where credit is due; The role of Jenny is one of a few female characters in film whose purpose of existence is not defined solely through the male lead (although her story is chronicled on a separate timeline than Forrest's).  The Bubba character was given a good dose of sympathy to prevent him from becoming a Southern country-boy caricature.  And his friendship with Forrest demonstrates an indifferent towards American racism that only a child is capable of (also remember, these two guys are from the South).  I was most impressed with the song medley they concocted for the running sequence.  The scene takes place in the late 70's, and they choose all these classic 70's songs that have themes of movement or travel (\"Go Your Own Way,\" \"Running On Empty,\" \"On The Road Again,\" \"Against The Wind\"). It is all edited together quite wonderfully.  I'm not a huge Zemekis fan (I think his Spielbergian tendencies are a little obvious at times), but this is a beautiful film.",

A story of a simple man's triumph over life's obstacles in his quest for his true love. \nTom Hanks gives the best performance of his career, surpassing his first Oscar winning performance in Philadelphia.  The entire cast turns in brilliant portrayals of their own, from Robin Wright to Sally Field, with several \"scene stealers\" from the talented Gary Sinise. \nEric Roth's screenplay (based on the novel) was nothing short of genius and it kept you riveted to the screen as the story unfolded, waiting to see the next chapter in Forrest's unbelievable life.  Even after countless viewings, I am still mesmerized. Through the wonders of special effects, the life of Forrest Gump is intertwined with a string of historical events resulting in a poignant journey of life through one man's eyes.  Through all that happens to him he never loses sight of the one thing that is missing from his life - his Jenny.  His love for her is the backbone of this movie and is one of the most moving love stories I have seen on the big screen to date. \nAll in all, the Best Picture Oscar was more than deserved.  While its competitors were all excellent movies in their own right, Forrest Gump offers a complete movie going experience - romance, action, comedy, history, brilliant direction, a unique screenplay and outstanding performances. What more could you possibly ask for?  A refreshing piece of film-making genius that is sure to become a classic in years to come.",

I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.\nWatch this film and ask yourself \"What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?\" Forrest seems to have made the \"right\" choices and been at the \"right place at the right time\" for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?",

The plot might have been a little shaky and it might have dragged on a little bit but it was so good and so loaded with drama and adventure it didn't bother me at all that it dragged on a little. The people I know who didn't like it didn't like it mainly because they thought it went a little overboard with all his achievements but I think it was to bring out some important things in history and what a way to do it. By sticking a made up character through it all. It got my attention. I love the soundtrack to. I day before I saw this I had said Tom Hanks was a bad actor boy did those words come back to haunt me. I had never seen such good acting in my life at the time. Not only do I think everyone should see this movie I think they should own it and the soundtrack. Matter a fact I'm gonna go watch it right now.",

Everyone involved with this monster should be ashamed of themselves. Ditto for the geniuses who showered this piece of dreck with honors. Worst irony of all: this awful film beat out the superb 'Shawshank Redemption' for Best Picture! Yikes!",

The altering of the old footage was so masterfully done and the incorporating of historical and social events almost convinces you that Forrest Gump was a real person.

Tom Hanks is one of the best actors that I have ever seen and his portrayal of the slightly dim but warm hearted Forrest Gump is just one of the many examples of this. The plot is very cleverly interwoven with very memorable historical events making us relate and love the character Gump even more. To say that this film is over-rated is to be blind to the pure genius that is the whole story. If it is such a bad film then why would it have been nominated for so many awards? Why did Tom Hanks win an oscar for it? Finally, why is it repeated on TV all the time with thousands upon millions of viewers tuning in to watch Forest's trials and tribulations, slowly but surely falling in love with his character and watching with disgust at Jenny as she fails to notice this sweet, kind and caring man infront of her and chooses the guys who will only let her down time and time again. When I see that film, I always cry, and call me sentimental if you want I can't help but relate to this poor boy who just wants the simple life without having all these people entwined with him, many presidents, Elvis, Chinese world ping-pong champions and the first ever black people to be allowed in white schools! Even through all this, anyone who has a heart can not fail to be touched by, even though this guy has everything that anyone could ever want, all he wants is Jenny.",

    "reviewBody": "I adore this movie. The casting was exceptional, especially Sally Field and Robin Wright Penn. The soundtrack fit perfectly. The only thing is, I don't believe many people actually understand what Forrest Gump is about. Many see it as a sentimental story among the backdrop of the late twentieth century, complete with events like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the Disco Era, the AIDS scare, ect. Actually, this film is a spoof on reality. I came up with this theory the first time I watched it, and have since heard similar comments from the director, Robert Zemekis. It is absurd how a man from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled in American history - becoming a war hero, meeting several presidents, playing ping-pong in China. It's really a comment on American life. In a way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman. That, along with everything I have already mentioned, makes this a brilliant and wonderful film. If you have never thought of this before, try watching the film with this theory in mind. I promise you'll see it in a different way.",

    "reviewTitle": "I can see why people might dislike this film, but...",
    "reviewBody": "... I gotta say, I love it!  Whether you agree with me will probably depend on whether the whimsical tone of the film is likely to make you want to smile or puke.  As I said, I'm in the former camp, but I can well understand anybody who disagrees.  This film is certainly a devisive topic amongst my friends and I, faintly dodgy politics and all (more on that later...)Before I offer my critique of the film, I just wanna touch on two issues that are vaguely related.  Firstly, the IMDB lists \"The Deer Hunter\" as a recommendation to those who like this movie.  What??  Let me assure you, two more movies that are so totally different as these pair would be hard to find.  There is a VERY tenuous possible link with Vietnam, but aside from that we're dealin' with chalk and cheese.  I recommend cinema and/or De Niro buffs check out \"TDH\" for completist sakes, because it's good, but IMHO vastly over-rated (I know people will say the same about \"Forrest Gump\"!). Anyhow, the tone of the two films is completely different, so in my estimation a slight error within the IMDB there...Secondly, I know people complain because there was a crop of other good movies to get a Best Picture nod in '94, and \"Gump\" beat them to it. Most - if not all - of the films nominated that year would have been deserving winners.  It just so happened that the Academy plumped for Gump (sorry about the excruciating rhyme...)  This does not devalue Forrest Gump against the more dramatic pictures any more then it reflects badly on the runners up. It was just a very good period for film, and all us cinema fans should be thankful for that...Now that I've got that off my chest, back to the film in question.  I feel that Hanks' performance stays just on the right side of cloying sentimentality, always threatening to tip over the edge, but never quite doing so.  This must be testament to Hanks skill as an actor, as with many other actors in the role the character could have become fiercely irritating during the lengthly running time.  Again, I'm well aware of the arguments that say the character was annoying from the START, but I never felt that to be the case.An able supporting cast serve to back up Hanks, and there is a wonderful turn from Gary Sinise as \"Lt Dan Taylor\".  His character ALMOST threatens to inject some edge into the character's ultra-PC universe, but maybe that reflects the fact that the other characters are so wholesome rather than that he is nasty.(SPOILERS)It's a fun jaunt through some 40 years (I think...) of history, refreshingly not confined entirely to American culture.  John Lennon makes an 'appearance' at one stage (You could argue that he represents 'cross-culture', but I'm claiming him as one of our own, even though I'm not a Scouser but a Manc).  To those who think part of the fun in watching a movie is predicting events, this one won't provide you with much of a challenge.  I recommend sitting back and allowing yourself to be drawn into the movie universe.As other users have pointed out before me, the film can possibly be seen as having a 'reactionary' viewpoint.  Having the main female character die of AIDS as a consequence of her earlier hedonist actions seems depressingly intolerant if it was intended to convey some sort of message to the audience.  I have no idea if events in the book are the same.  For those of you looking for deep subtextual material, it's certainly a juicy bone of contention, but the film can be enjoyed just as well on a purely simplistic level.  I don't think the political bias is strong enough to ruin the film. As for my view on whether any such connotation was deliberate, let's just say it wouldn't surprise me...(SPOILER END)To close, many of my friends voice much the same objections about the film that I have seen on this site.  If the potential for nostalgia combined with goofy fantasy doesn't sound like it will be your thing, then by all means avoid.  If, however, the concoction I have described sounds suited to your tastes, then enjoy; because I guarantee you won't find many better examples of this type of thing around.",

    "reviewTitle": "Surprisingly enjoyable",
    "reviewBody": "There's something of a tradition in fiction of using the idiot savant to hold the mirror up to society and reflect its foibles. The figure of the Good Soldier Schweik was one I remember being introduced to in my early years at university. Forrest Gump is also a soldier for much of this picture's duration, but the satire is diluted to no more than a few bum and fart jokes in the presence of the great and the good.Maybe it's this evasiveness that caused this film to attract such a storm of criticism from the Left when it first appeared. Seven years on, it's hard to see the film's reluctance to take on biting social satire as something it deserved to be damned for. More likely, it's the film's unflattering portrayal of the counter culture of the sixties that made its baby boomer critics touchy. For the most part, it's a gentle and appealingly whimsical picture. Australian - and more particularly, Melbourne - viewers will recognize in it something of the spirit of Michael Leunig's cartoons. In keeping with this spirit is the one aspect of this film that could be regarded as controversial, which is its scepticism toward causes.\nTom Hanks is excellent. It says something about the rest of the world's stereotypes about American culture that one of America's biggest movie stars can hold the screen for hour after hour while remaining the most self-effacing of actors. There is charm and real emotion in his performance. If the film sometimes veers into sentimentality (and it does) it is not Hanks' fault. The film isn't a masterpiece. As I say, it does sometimes lapse into sentimentality, and it annoys me that, like Rain Man, it can't acknowledge disability without conferring on its disabled characters superhuman talents of one kind or another. And, as I'm sure others have pointed out, the trick shots involving Gump's encounters with various historical personages had already been done - to much sharper comic effect - by Woody Allen in Zelig. However, for me the film's greatest specific failing is that it doesn't do more with the character of Gump's love, Jenny, who doesn't do much more in this film than turn up every half hour or so and look beautiful. I thought there was scope there to explore the nature of their mutual dependence more deeply, and to illuminate both characters in the process. To some extent this does happen with the character of Lieutenant Dan, a nicely drawn character who provides the right sort of counterweight to Gump.I don't expect that I will want to see this film again and again, the way I keep going back to Leunig's cartoons, which have a kind of natural wisdom-in-innocence that Zemeckis' film sometimes visibly strains to achieve. It's not a film that particularly goes anywhere, not that it really means to. But, a little to my surprise, I did enjoy watching it.",

I guess \"Jennay\" forgot to tell that to Forrest before she died.  GET TESTED, FORREST, and RUN!I don't mean to be abrasive, but after a second viewing of \"Forrest Gump,\" I noticed this glaring omission.  Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have included something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.  To me, this is a giant hole in the film, and one that needed to be addressed.And regarding the film itself...Personally, I'm in the middle; I don't love or hate \"Forrest Gump.\"  The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the film, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable and humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.  In the end, the good outweighed the bad slightly, and I came away satisfied but not totally pleased.  Zemeckis has made better films (try \"Back to the Future,\" \"Contact,\" and even \"Cast Away\"), and so has Hanks.I recommend \"Forrest Gump\" marginally because it has a good heart and a good, interesting story...but it also has its fair share of flaws.  \"Pulp Fiction\" and especially \"The Shawshank Redemption\" deserved the Academy Awards, but oh well...don't complain over something so trivial...awards don't mean THAT much.\"Forrest Gump\" can have a 7/10 from me.",

Forrest would actually be teased if not killed for being this dumb in the deep south but add a soundtrack of hits, catch phases, and Tom Hanks' bad 'tard impression and a tear jerker is born. Duh, ignorance is bliss.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Film, Horrible Message",
    "reviewBody": "I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship  and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn)  but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump  he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish  in fact, a few are downright noble  I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.",

Forrest Gump is just about a simple man living through his life. It's not a historical documentary it is a movie, and a masterpiece movie.Tom Hanks, yet again is as perfect as ever and rightly enough won the best actor oscar. (Anyone who doesn't like Hanks I don't understand, what is there to dislike about him??!!) The supporting cast, especially Gary Sinise, Sally Field and Robin Wright are also magnificent and together they all put the cherry on the cake for this movie.I agree that it is a (sort of) American movie but that doesn't make it a bad or wrong movie. It wasn't overrated in the slightest because it is such a great movie and I believe that it deserved all of the credit and awards that it receievd.If you love movies and Tom Hanks (like moi!) and are willing to watch anything with an open mind then do yourself a favour and see it. I gurantee that this superb best picture oscar winner (and rightly so too), it will not disapoint you.Thank you all for being patient to read this, I'm glad I got that off my chest!",

Not the soundtrack, which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious exception.Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but this movie seems made only for them. Forrest Gump shouldn't have been premiered in the rest of the world. I don't think most of the audience outside the States certainly liked it, though it was a smash everywhere. More probably they went to see it because the word had been out that they had to.I ussually like US movies, but not the silly and patriotic like Forrest Gump. It's an annoying and stupid film whose subject matter is that in the US even a dumb bloke like him may hit the big time.Five out of ten, and that's being too fair.",

It's not because I wasn't liking it but they could've made it shorter.  *Next paragraph is full of SPOILERS* The woman \"Jenny\" I didn't like her at all.  To me, she used Forrest all along.  First, she should've never accepted to take his medal of honor the first time (although later she gave it back).  Second, she left him many times and didn't want to marry him. And then, she took him back & wanted to marry him ONLY AFTER she learned that she was sick.  IMO, she married him just so that he takes care of her & son.  I just thought she didn't really love him and only acted in her own interest.Anyways, it's a good movie if you like the type.",

    "reviewBody": "About 6 months ago I saw a picture of the set of 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' featuring Keanu Reeves on horseback shooting at motorcyclists. It was such a great looking shot that I have been waiting eagerly to see how it looked in the actual film ever since. It did not let me down. The style this film possesses is insane. It is one of the best looking action films I have ever seen.The pacing of this film is also incredible. It starts the action immediately and almost never lets up. I can't wait to see what the death count was in this film because it will be truly enormous. The only problem is when the death count is that high the film can struggle to keep the originality up. After a while each death starts to look very similar to the last, and the 50 before that, and it can even become a little tedious to watch.The only other flaw I came across with the film was that John Wick is on the defence too much. Instead of being angry and on the hunt like the first two films, for the majority of the Chapter 3 he is in survival mode. Still very fun to watch, but it isn't quite the same as seeing him take brutal revenge.And the film is brutal. I could be wrong but I don't remember the first two entries in the series making me cringe in terms of violence as much. There were some very hard things to watch at times in this movie even for me, and I pride myself on handling those sorts of things fine most of the time. One of them early on got an audible gasp from the entire audience and I saw multiple people having to turn their heads to the side.'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is two hours of your life that will pass by very quickly. This is as non-stop action as films get. I think this is the third best action series currently producing movies (after 'James Bond' and 'Mission Impossible'). Will it get a third one? The first entry on the trivia page suggests no, however the end of this movie suggests yes? I guess we will have to wait to find out. For now enjoy the hell out of this one.",

    "reviewTitle": "Pure, delirious joy in the form of yet another exhilarating thriller",
    "reviewBody": "Following on from two deliriously entertaining, visually gorgeous and blissfully simplistic thrillers, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum keeps up the franchise's unique appeal in stunning fashion. Complete with electrifying action, beautiful cinematography, a pulsating score and a great sense of humour, the film is pretty much as purely joyful as action thrillers get, and proves two hours of brilliant entertainment.Before I get into all of that, though, one of the greatest things about this franchise is just how simplistic it is. You may have seen John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2, you may not have done. Going into this third film, however, it's all pretty irrelevant, and while the first two films are certainly worth your time, absolutely anybody can go and watch this movie without any prior knowledge, and simply sit back and watch the fireworks.The plot is effectively laid out for you in the first ninety seconds of the movie. John Wick is excommunicated, and there's a $14m bounty on his head. That's it. Following that brief bit of exposition are two hours of beautifully simple yet endlessly entertaining action, and while the film does keep you engrossed with its sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding this world of allegiances and deception, it's the thrill of the chase that really matters.In that, there's almost never a moment where storytelling takes precedence over action thrills, with the movie bursting into life by way of an exhilarating opening act. However, much like the first two films, not every moment is fighting and shootouts, with the mystery, the tension and the intrigue all playing a part as John Wick encounters numerous people from his past in all manner of different scenarios.There are moments in its middle portion that do drag a little more than others, and where the story perhaps gets a little self-indulgent, however there's no denying just how slick and purely entertaining a thriller this is regardless.Of course, the action itself is brilliant as well. The opening act is astonishing, filled to the brim with insane action that features seamless fight choreography, brilliant camerawork and a fantastic sense of self-awareness that allows you to laugh at the most ridiculous moments. From then on, the film continues to burst into life with mad, energetic and dazzling action sequences again and again, only furthering the sheer entertainment appeal of the whole affair.Also, there's no getting away from just how good-looking a movie this is. The camerawork in the fight sequences is certainly excellent, but it's the film's kaleidoscopic colour pallette and slick cinematography that makes it a feast for the eyes, pulling off the style of a pure pulp thriller in brilliant fashion once again, and with a pulsating, intense score playing throughout to boot, you'll definitely be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum isn't much different from the previous two movies. It isn't the world's most intricate or intelligent thriller. However, with brilliant energy, dazzling visuals, stunning action and an invaluable sense of fun, absolutely none of that matters, and it instead proves a solidly entertaining, manic and dizzyingly joyful thriller throughout.",

While the action, the choreography and cinematography are better then ever, it feels John Wick is out of stories to tell.\nI don't expect much story from a movie like John Wick, but a little bit more emotional stakes or a goal would have been nice. Because the movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes long, only action and no narrative makes the action repetitive and boring. The ending also felt really cheap. The promise they made in the second movie is only prolonged by a similar ending in this one. What will likely be John Wick 4, should have been the second half of this movie. I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. But I was overall a little disappointed.",

I hope that those people have a break so that they can find the best ideas for a second trilogy. Unfortunately, this movie will help Avatar stay on top, a complex action movie and a gorgeous screenplay, find out John Wick's real home and see how he was physically injured twice, and the second which was brutal and unexpected (I am referring to the end of the film) I was shocked and satisfied because now he has another reason to take revenge.",

    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the first two productions of John Wick, really looking forward to the third one. Overall it was enjoyable but felt a little flat towards the end. Keanu Reeves was great as usual. I am not so sure about Halley Barry's performance, felt too forced at some point, though, she fought just as well. I wished the story would have revealed more about the world of the characters introduced rather than just en passing, have less but sharp action sequences but more of the story development on the different factions. The best fight sequences are in the beginning, after that it seems a little repetitive. Some parts of the actions felt confusing. One example is when John Wick faces two opponents in the Casablanca alleyway, while holding onto one knife attacker to fight the other, the first opponent remains inactive far too long to be unrealistic. It feels like the director compromised with that shot. Another scene in the end fight where two attackers with turtle neck sweater and jacket, both intentionally look similar going up against Wick. Wick kills one of them, but the other never reappears. I will have to watch it again to make sense. I will hold out on the third one giving it the benefit of the doubt as it leads to the fourth installment. I hope there's a better payoff. My 2 cents take on this one.",

Its been a long dam time but this was an awesome performance on her part.The real letdown here is for all the amazing use of practical effects and wonderful action and choreography, the minimal and limited CGI used, was outrightly terrible.Every gun shot had CGI blood splatter, and they looked terrible. If they had just used no blood splatters at all, that would have been even better. Some knife play scenes where the knife went into a person's body, looked super fake. The terrible CGI really took me out of the film.There is a major climatic scene where John falls off of a very high building, Its obviously CGI, and terribly so.For one of the few major scenes where a lot of CGI was used they could have made sure that one scene looked as good as possible.But they didn't.",

John Wick 3 is as you would expect jam packed with action, great scenes and even builds upon the world that we already know in a very, very good way.The fight choreography is absolutely amazing and John is as usual utterly bad-ass, beautiful locations come into this chapter that we haven't seen in the previous two and there's a reasonably good level of over the top \"wow\" moments to the point of the audience literally laughing at how insane it is however......something was not quite right with this, I love that it is not what you expect and it hasn't fallen into the last Jedi or game of thrones trap or subversion yet there were, in my opinion, some severe issues with the third act of the film.While I can agree that there is a serious amount of poetic license and suspension of belief required to enjoy the John Wick franchise it kept it to a level of agreeableness in the first 2 films, it gets somewhat outlandish and rather ridiculous unfortunately in this chapter.Overall it's a good film, well worth seeing and the action is fantastic but the ending is to me very, very odd, the final fight sequence is not great (the first 30 minutes is by far the best part of the film) and some of the characters really don't quite hit the mark, especially, and unfortunately, Lawrence Fishburne as the Bowery King and Halle Berry as.... cant say due to spoilers.It's the weakest one of the three but it's still good, enjoy the action, and enjoy the (majority of) the characters, at the end though I fear you will be a bit lost to it all, certainly not a great ending to what is otherwise the best action movie trilogy for a long, long time.",

Yes there are elements which are a straight continuation from the first two films, but what impressed me is that the film didn't rely on them. There's new ideas here and they were well executed (pun intended).Standard brawls and mini fights are a plenty but as I say the film didn't over rely on them. There was nothing goofy about these, they were quick, intense and they moved you swiftly through. The more showpiece fight scenes really do show off a higher level of choreography planning but also the actual execution of both audio and visual was immense.Even the plot impressed me. I don't think anyone really watches John Wick films for the plot but in this one there is a bit more substance to it. At times it does catch you by surprise.There are seldom trilogies that improve with each film and depending on how you feel about the first two, this might be one of them.",

    "reviewTitle": "Promising start and then...",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick is no longer a small start-up movie that caught our eye and re-energised the revenge genre. The producers of John Wick, with both eyes clearly on building a profitable franchise, have decided to do a Mission Impossible with The Syndicate and 007 with Spectre, and create a super organisation - The High Table. And with it (roll eyes moment) rules, regulations, protocol etc which are all becoming too often and too much these days.What this means is, we get an all out action-packed opening of 20-odd minutes before the show becomes a platform for product placements and poorly choreographed fight scenes where you can see Keanu 'acting' more than fighting and in fact, struggling to keep up (and not because he is injured or has been thrown about). The fight scenes, many shot wide angle, do not have the energy and intensity of the opening sequences and there are many, many moments where you feel 'oh come on, John's whole body is open for attack'. Laurence Fishburn, Angelica Houston and Halle Berry are wasted and don't even get me started on Asia Kate Dillon - she is annoying in Billions, even more so here. I am a big fan of the first John Wick, was ho-hum about the sequel but this third one, haiz...can't say I'm looking forward to a 4th instalment. There may be a High Table but there's nothing inviting on it.",

    "reviewBody": "PROS: Nice action for most part, although having John Wick killing everybody for 2 hours leads to some repetitive death/fight patterns and yawns. Very good photography and some cool visuals.CONS: No script whatsoever, almost no dialogue (and when there is some it seems like a 7 year old Stallone wrote it, plus almost all lines are delivered badly by the cast). Makes zero sense (they had so many chances to kill off john wick but left him alive only so that wick could kill them instead) . Has no plot! Just fights and fights. Should end sooner, can't make a two hour movie with kicks and shoots only. I regretted buying a ticket for this.",

    "reviewTitle": "A masterclass in action movie making!",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 ParabellumSo the easiest way to sum up JW3 is that if like me you enjoyed the first two instalments then this third outing for Baba Yaga will be right up your street.\nThe plot is thin and simple.\nJohn is on the run from every hitman and assassin on the planet and he must come up with some rather creative ways in which to stay alive.JW3 is a masterclass in action movie making.\nI truly believe stuntmen and women should get Oscars.\nThe work gone into making this sequel is groundbreaking in terms of practical stunts and effects.\nThere also should be a category for best performance in an action role. In which Keanu Reeves would win hands down.\nIn my review for JW2 I said the film left me fatigued with too much repetition.\nOnly after buying the Blu-ray of that movie did I truly appreciate it.\nJW3 on the other hand isn't repetitive in terms of the action sequences.\nThere's some real creativity gone into developing every action scene.\nInventive and impressive are words that can be used to describe each set piece.\nThe opening fight sequence involving a rather tall gentleman and a book sets the tone.\nThen we are treated to knife fights. Fights on horseback, Fights on motorcycles,Fights with guns. Lots of guns!\nOh and there's Halle Berry's attack dogs which are awesome!\nSpeaking of Miss Berry. She's fantastic and really sells her action scenes.\nSadly though she's a little under-utilised. Her part isn't as big as the trailers would have you believe.\nThere's strong support from 90's straight to video star Mark Dacascos.\nIt was nice to see him again. He's an accomplished martial artist who never really got the recognition he deserved during his heyday.JW3 is going to be a fine looking movie when it makes its way on to 4K Blu-ray. I believe the HDR in this film will look sublime.\nThe film projected well in the theatre and often cinema screens can look a tad murky.\nIn terms of sound design this film sounded amazing.\nThe final shoot out was truly spectacular.\nEach different gun having its own signature sound.\nBass was really punchy.\nEvery punch, kick and cracking bone could be heard to earsplitting effect.In terms of plot and storytelling this is where the film stumbles a little. My score for this movie kept fluctuating due to the convoluted plot.\nI think the scriptwriters have tried to build a franchise out of the first films simple premise and it is always apparent that it seems forced.\nA minor gripe because in terms of the action genre all the John Wick movies must be regarded as all time greats.\nThe JW franchise will become classics of the genre unlike the tripe certain over the hill action stars churn out. (I'll name no names but a fat guy with a goatee and a ponytail springs to mind).\nJW will be a classic because they're inventive, well shot and expertly made.\nEvery punch, kick and shot to the head can be seen.\nThere's no shaky-cam. No choppy editing hiding the fact that the actors can't do the business.\nThe audience are treated to a visual chaotic feast of violence.\nIf indeed this type of thing is up your street then JW3 is going to be one for your Blu-ray collection.\nA film that if judged solely on its action set pieces then it's the best of the three.\nHowever overall as a movie we the audience aren't emotionally connected to JW3 as we were with the first film.\nIt has a over convoluted plot that expands on the second films flaws.\nStill I'm up for John Wick: Chapter 4, I'll be there opening night.",

    "reviewBody": "I loved the first JW and saw it as a crazy fun return to the 90's action flicks such as The Rock, The Matrix,etc.. The sequel was heavy on the close quarters combat, the tactical gun play between pistol, shotgun and rifle and mostly delivered though some of the character development or just quality of actors was not on par with the first.The third instalment starts out well hitting hard with great successive action scenes including the knife fight and the great horse shoot out. Somewhere after this things started to lag. I think it was the moment the adjudicator character turns up to be fun police. That's how it felt. Along come the rules to curb the crazy balls out fun we loved in the first instalment.The rest of the movie is a bit scrappy and although we have high velocity action pawn all over the place it doesn't quite hit the spot.I was left puzzled at the end and gave up on ever caring about the next instalment.",

It dragging on for too long, I think those time could have better used for the supported characters. I want to know more about Sofia past, the old lady at the ballet theater ( I forgot her name), the 'Elder'... Well, maybe that's for the part 4. There definitely will be a movie number 4.\nThe shooting scenes are freaking awesome. The blade throwing fight at the beginning are super hilarious.\nThe betrayal at the end is not much of a surprise. But seriously they buffed John Wick a lot, he had been shoot, bleeding a lot, took a lot of beating and falling from that high and still alive? Oh, this movie got lot of glass shattering, I got really bored after that thing repeated for the n+ time.\nOverall, I can't wait for John Wick chapter 4.",

    "reviewBody": "It is nice to see that Parabellum has not reality concerns and this approach suits to John Wick series anyway. But when it comes to build up a \"mythologic\" ambience; some religious, historical, and political facts should have been considered.(1) Continental's real life equivalent seems to be NATO but judging by the heavy emphasis on Christianity, it is most probably Schengen. So the top dog who is claimed to be higher than high table should have been Greek, not Egyptian. Ancient Egypt concept would have been appropriate if Continental was a Jewish organisation.\n(2) It is nice to see that Continental is open for former European colonies and have no religious concerns but as I said before, due to the organisation's heavy emphasis on Christianity, a non-Muslim country such as India would have been much more appropriate than Morocco.\n(3) Even though Parabellum is a Hollywood product, John Wick trilogy has no problem with having a protagonist with Slavic origin and a Russian \"not-so-bad\" antagonist. So, Continental would have been spreaded over Balkans as well. It would brillantly suit to Continental's cosmopolitanist nature.",

    "reviewTitle": "Finally an action franchise than doesn't lose its touch!",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.As with the previous 2 installments, John Wick 3 is where Keanu Reeves is at home. This role was just made for him, and watching him stand toe to toe with powerhouses like Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Huston, not only shows how good he is as an action star, but as an actor in general. He hasn't been given a role this good since the Matrix, but those movies never showed how good he was just at acting. He sells this movie.The supporting cast is all amazing, and I loved how they left their character's hanging, giving us hope of seeing them in future installments. I also loved how more in-depth the movie spent on world-building. The way it brings in different cultures into this assassin guild is done very well.John Wick 3 is an amazing action movie that never loses its steam throughout, and its 2 hour run times flies past, because of non-stop action that is directed and choreographed to perfection. I can't wait to see if they manage to pull off the 4th like they did here.8.8/10",

No risks at all.Fightwise, the only novelty we have that is now already a brand is our character's damage that somehow transcends the challenges. So don't come for the action. Come for the world-building.It is astonishingly compelling, extended from the 'Godfather' tradition of 'rules and consequences'. It is comically extreme but consistent and logical. I can recommend this because of the thought that went into the creation of the world and the elaborate setup for the next film. That setup is tantalising.The idea that what keeps him going, pushes him through is personally attractive. He wants to live to remember his wife.",

    "reviewTitle": "His legacy lives on!",
    "reviewBody": "Para bellum - prepare for war (Latin - English). John Wick is back for more than two hours of hardcore violence with a hint of comedy spiced with exhilaratingly exhausting chases all over the globe. Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an epic pandemonium, made to satisfy fans of this franchise, but also to surprise the non-believers with his superbly choreographed fight sequences.This chapter starts where the last film ended. Wick is running out of time and in less than an hour he will be excommunicated from the global community of assassins and can't use any of their hideouts or facilities anymore. Every assassin in New York will be hunting him down - since the price on his head is a staggering $14 million.If you really think assassins have the patience to wait until the High Table (the global organisation of assassins) tells you the hunt has begun, you're in for a surprise. There's killers everywhere and Wick bumps into one very tall man early on in a library, for some close-up combat with books. It doesn't take long before the next battle starts in an antique store where cabinets get shattered to start a lethal knife throwing sequence with deadly consequences.Our man knows he can't keep battling an entire city of assassins forever, he goes looking for a way out and this is where we get to know a bit more about John himself. Anjelica Huston plays a cold-blooded woman who knows John from a previous life. After handing her a talisman he once earned for doing something terrible, he's here to ask for a favour - sneak him out of the US. They owe him that one thing, and Wick is off to Morocco to get rid of his death sentence.Once arrived in North Africa, we get another look at Wick's lost past we know so little about. He has another marker/medallion in his pocket, to collect another favour. This one is destined for Sofia (Halle Berry, reminding us how bad ass she still is), whose daughter he rescued from an unspecified danger long ago. She has a pair of German shepherds who steal the show as bad guy's genitals butchers. The cinematography here is breathtaking, especially when we get to the Sahara and see Wick climbing the dunes in his suit. It's an action packed act that makes you ready for what you're about to witness back in New York City.A representative of the High Table has already arrived in the city and is here to punish those who helped Wick break the rules in the last film. The \"Adjudicator\" (Asia Kate Dillon) gives both the king of the Bowery's bums (Laurence Fishburne) and director of assassins' hotel The Continental, Winston (Ian McShane), seven days to put their affairs in order before they're removed from their roles. Whatever that may mean. While Wick was on his way back, the Adjudicator visited some sidewalk sushi bar and hired the chef/hitman to lead a crew of assassins that will make an end to John Wick's legacy once and for all.Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his crew, are fans of the legendary Wick. While they fangirl in between throwing him through glass walls, they're still here to finish him off. This final showdown happens in Winston's all-glass administrative offices, where nothing is what it seems. Playing with cold glass walls and neon lights has never been more impressive and fun. Even when everything gets smashed to smithereens.With every chapter, this franchise gets bolder and more impressive. This bares the question if they can keep this level of excitement going like other successful franchises, or if this is Reeves' magnum opus as Wick?! I'd say \"dulce periculum\" and keep them coming. Let his legacy live on!",

    "reviewBody": "REVIEW - JOHN WICK 3Ok let's be honest and say it exactly how it is, those of us who have seen the 2 previous films know from start to finish what happens in these films, blood, shooting, stabbing, even more blood and lots and lots of hand to hand combat and all over a car and a dog.This film continues literally where the previous left off, with John given an hour to get out of New York.I would never have thought there would be so many assassins in such a small area but it seems in New York they are quite literally everywhere and everyone.Again let's be honest, for me this was by far the weakest story of the trilogy and in places was quite silly with huge plot holes which you could drive a HGV through but we don't go to see John Wick for a social commentary or an in depth story with twists and turns, no we go to see John Wick purely for the fights etc.I must admit the stunts in the film are exceptional!In essence don't expect any character development, don't expect a great story but you know with this film what you're going to get and get it you do, from the start to the end (or is it, no spoilers).Rating 8 out of 10",

    "reviewTitle": "A solid continuation of the title character's story",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the third entry in the John Wick action thriller series. Once again directed by Chad Stahelski and starring Keanu Reeves in the lead role, it is a solid continuation of the title character's story while adding even more to the world building element set up previously.Immediately after the events of John Wick: Chapter 2, former assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is on the run after killing a member of the High Table at The Continental hotel in Manhattan. With a $14 million bounty now on his head, Wick must find find a way to safely escape New York City, while avoiding death by other assassins from all parts of the world.As reliably action-packed as it is great to look at, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is so far the best installment of this ever growing franchise which serves to remind us that Keanu Reeves is deserving of his place back in the spotlight. Wick is still the \"one man army\" force to be reckoned with, and Reeves again adds that trademark nuance to his performance to help things along nicely. However, the film also introduces Halle Berry's character Sofia as a helpful accomplice of Wick, showing that she too may also have potential for an action star comeback. It's a shame she does not feature in the story as much as she should but there is hope she will return in the near future. Like its predecessors, the fight scenes are beautifully shot, owing to director Chad Stahelski's creative use of lighting and cinematography, giving them a noir-like vibe. In addition to this, the film also has some surprisingly funny moments of dark comic relief, which certainly helps ease the tension after some graphic violence. Even though the film does take the predictable route of sequel-baiting, I am definitely on board for any future follow-ups we may having coming our way.I rate it 8/10",

    "reviewTitle": "near non-stop bone-crunching action",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Worlds are colliding! No, no ... not in the way of \"The Avengers\" movies, but it's kind of hard not to smile when Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne share a scene (or two) in a mini-reunion of THE MATRIX. Mr. Reeves and director Chad Stahelski are back for a third time, and somehow they manage to raise the bar yet again on the fight sequences. And let's face it, the fighting and action are why so many are drawn to this franchise. This latest entry runs 2 hours and 10 minutes, and almost every bit is a frantic chase scene or violent fight ... or both.The film picks up mere moments after JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 ended. If you recall, John had killed a member of the High Table inside the Continental Hotel, an unforgivable break in the treasured rules. Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the hotel, has given his friend a one hour head start prior to issuing the \"excommunicado\". It's that order (and the $14 million bounty) that sends every assassin on the planet on Wick's trail.No need to wait for the good stuff ... the film's first two fight sequences are extraordinary feats of stunt coordination, and consume the first 15-20 minutes. Here is what John Wick (and we viewers) are in for: Guns (many kinds), lots of knives, a hatchet, swords, a book, enough broken glass to fill a recycle center, horses, motorcycles, cars, every martial art known to man, highly trained dogs, a public library, a museum/collectibles display, a stable, and a ballet theatre complete with dancers. There is even a current NBA player, 7'3\" Boban Marjonovic, who battles John Wick and ultimately learns books can be used for something other than reading.John Wick's background is revealed, and his general level of tiredness reaches exhaustion, which actually adds an element to a character who is quite efficient with his conversation. There are a few people who are called on to help Wick, in particular we have Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Anjelica Huston as the Ballet Director, and Halle Berry as Sophia, a former assassin who now runs the Continental Hotel in Morocco. See, even an underworld crime syndicate promotes from within. The segment with Sophia is one of the most fun, and it's not because of Ms. Berry. Rather her beautiful and highly-trained dogs are scene stealers who are devastating in their commitment to carry out orders.Other characters of interest include Asia Kate Dillon (\"Billions\") as the Adjudicator, one who enjoys doling out punishment; Mark Dacascos (Wo Fat in \"Hawaii 5-0) as Zero, the ultimate Wick fanboy who wants nothing more than to be the one who kills him; Jerome Flynn (\"Game of Thrones\") as Berrada, the senior official who doesn't negotiate fairly; Said Taghmaoui as The Elder from the High Table, who listens to Wick's proposal. Other supporting roles are filled admirably by Robin Lord Taylor, Jason Mantzoukas and Susan Blommaert. Of course, some of the most fun occurs again at The Continental Hotel as Reeves' Wick interacts with Lance Reddick and Ian McShane.From the department of \"Give 'em what they want\", the film has a very similar look, feel and tone to the first two, but director Stahelski (a standout stunt coordinator) and writers Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Mark Abrams keep it fresh with new characters, new props and some terrific set design. The early model computers are contrasted with the high tech gadgetry of the Continental, and with a body count likely higher than the first two films combined, this entry can best be described as brutally entertaining ... is that even a thing? The violence is vivid and excessive and non-stop, and if that's not your style, you should at least know that the title is taken from the Latin \"Si vis pacem, para bellum\" - If you want peace, prepare for war.",

    "reviewTitle": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum - 9/10",
    "reviewBody": "Parabellum is an absolutely outstanding and genre-refining film. It's been a long while since we had seen any movies that redefined the action genre up till Mission Impossible: Fallout. Not to say that this is better than that, but this definitely did what no other action movie could since then. It's films like Parabellum that make me love action, the kind of movies that I think about when I hear action. Keanu Reeves has absolutely killed it with this role. He is insanely good with action and he just seems to never get too old for it. Halle Berry is incredibly good, and was very good in all her action scenes too. The action in this movie is by far the best part. It looks extremely realistic, and is brutal, fun and ruthless in every single way. Cerep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian are back again, and they make some very lovable scenes for Indonesian audiences, back with the jokes and incredible stunt acting. The theater was gasping in the first big fight, shocked and slowly realizing what they had actually came in to watch. It is extremely well choreographed with everything being realistic. When there's action, you know what's going on, and you are locked in to whatever's happening. The story is excellent, and just makes so much sense as an excuse for tons of action. The title \"Parabellum\" suits this film very well. This world is out for John Wick, as all his comrades learn to pay for their mistakes. The whole world turns on him, and this is a plot that's just executed extremely well. The issue with this movie, is that there's a lot going on, and it leads to a small bit of pacing issues. The movie can feel a little bit lost at times until you see what happens after the certain scene. There's also a little bit of bad voice acting in a scene, but other than that, not much to complain about. The action shows that the genre can be varied masterfully. We don't need magic, superheros or bombs to have a good time at the movie theater. Parabellum is a replenishing, fun and insanely entertaining movie overall. It stands strong as the best John Wick movie so far. This movie is totally worth a watch. If you don't like gore, this is likely not for you. For anyone who has seen the previous films and loved them, this is definitely for you and it's the kind of action the film industry has missed for 2 years. You also do not need to see the other ones to understand this, but I suggest just knowing the basic plot of the first 2 films.",

    "reviewTitle": "There is more to it than just mind-blowing action!",
    "reviewBody": "This is the definition of an action film in all of its glory!! I am amazed that this \"franchise\" has done it again with another good entry, only this time the action was turned up to 100. If you thought that the other two \"John Wick\" films had great action, this one blows them out of the water and puts them to shame. Some parts of this film are truly insane.......However as a mentioned in the title this film is more than just action set piece after another, there is an interesting continuation of the story.The first piece of praise has to go to Chad Stahelski who has directed the living heck out of this film, in some ways I cannot believe to imagine the headache and joy this film must have been for him. The amount of detail that has gone into this film is something that shouldn't go unnoticed just because it an action film. Even though the film is very action heavy Stahelski has managed to still careful weave an interesting story throughout that definitely keeps you guessing. He has created the perfect blend of the familiar whilst also introducing new things into the series. Absolutely fantastic from his side of things.The cast all round is fantastic and might be the most solid one out of all three films thus far. The biggest shoutout obviously goes to Keanu Reeves who once again just kicks ass in this film whilst still managing to show us this very complex and damaged character. I have heard that Reeves tries to do as much of the stunt work as possible.....i could be misinformed.......I hope this is true. In certain moments I believe it is because you see his face........yeah I know they could CG his face but.........I will give him the benefit of the doubt. All in all he is fantastic once again.\nOther shoutouts should be for Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Lance Reddick who are all great either new or returning characters.Now the biggest positive of this film is the fight/stunt choreography. To put it mildly it is jaw droppingly brilliant, I don't think I know enough words in the English dictionary to describe it. It was pure action brilliance on display......this is why the Oscars needs a stunt category. The level set by the previous two films has been completely destroyed and new level has been set not only for this film but action films in general. Every single action set piece is unique whether it be featuring a different location, weapon or personnel all of them show the versatility of action and they seamlessly fit into the film. To be perfectly honest I was shocked at the level of gore as well in this film which was definitely not as prevalent in the other two films. Mind-blowing!!!Lastly the villain was actually quite good in this one, not like the last entry which wasn't great. It is someone you can completely understand there motivations and intentions as to why they are doing things, its a good performance from Asia Kate Dillion.Overall this film is good, its so close to very good unfortunately there are a couple of minor things that didn't work for me. Its just certain character decisions and a scene involving a roof, I won't spoil it, you know what I mean. 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10, I've only given it this score because thats the same score I gave the other two films. I'd say this one is better than Chapter 2 but not quite as good as the first, from a story and emotional standpoint.Saying all of that you will not be disappointed walking out of this pure action blockbuster entertainment from start to finish.",

Definitely owe it to yourself to watch Parabellum if you're a fan of Keanu Reeves and love great action movies. It is my favourite of the trilogy. It was truly spectacular",

    "reviewTitle": "Flawed but extraordinary at the same time.",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is good but suffers from its eccentricities. It is a very well made, interesting and flawed. The main problem with the film is it feels like it 'jumps the shark' a little and whilst this isn't full 'jump the shark' it does go far enough over that the thread of believability even in a stylised world goes to pot at times.So you have 2 options to ignore the silliness or just go along for the ride. Fortunately, there is a lot to ride on and the film never gets boring or dull.The action is excellent and the fight scenes are stunning, occasionally slight over gruesome and often very funny but always exceptionally well done.The new characters are a mixed bag, with some far more successful than others, with Halle Berry's character standing out above all, in what is her best action role.As for the main protagonist, Mark Dacascos is interesting and at times odd and I am not not sure the humorous touches quite work.The more established characters such as Winston and Charon, have more to do in this film but several of the other characters from previous films do go missing in this film.As for Keanu Reeves, he plays John Wick in a very similar way to the first 2 films.The directing and cinematography are excellent, as has been the case with the last 2 films. Chad Stahelski plays to the films strengths and there is very little time to step back and relax.So despite my problems with the film I did enjoy it and would recommend it to others who enjoyed the last couple of films.",

The humor is still one of the film's strong points, with a lot of witty comments from the characters through out its playtime. The characters, old and new, are just as interesting as in the previous titles. As we dig even deeper into the universe, from which Wick was molted by, we truly get an insight of just how powerful the organization is, and how long it stretches.All around a fantastic action film, that through well thought violence, slick humor, and interesting characters keeps you hooked all the way.

John killed someone important and now he is on the run - from EVERYONE.When you have an unstoppable action hero movie, it always feels difficult to keep raising the stakes, but they surprisingly manage to do it a 3rd time.Does it have the same feeling as the first John Wick? No.Could anything else replicate that? No.Are they trying to achieve that? Also no.The movie is solid on its own. It employs excellent basics from great music to great visual composition, a nice selection of henchmen to be dispatched of by an ever increasingly angry John Wick and a nice cast of supporting characters showing up and providing more glimpses into the dark world that John Wick inhabits.There are parts of the movie that unfortunately felt a bit repetitive, but I wouldn't detract any points as at this stage it is difficult to find new and inventive ways of murdering people (they still do btw!), but this means that some scenes might feel a bit old. Despite this, each action scene is beautifully shot, the camera is still as ever and the feeling of force, violence and impact shines through the screen.From brutal takedowns, to great gun fights, horse chases and everything in between, John Wick 3 ups the stakes from all points of view.A lot more to say but doing so would spoil it. Watch it!",

    "reviewBody": "I'm not much of a reviewer or anything, but I really don't have many complaints in-regards to the film as a whole. The production team, directors, stuntmen etc. keep upping the bar with every John Wick entry and somehow surpass the previews scenes. Not to spoil anything but some of the kills were especially brutal to watch (ie. book... that is all)The story does what needs to do with some revelations at the end - the script was quite witty and kept the interest when there's no action sequence going on, but be rest assured, the whole film's an action sequence with occasional breaks.So yeah, watch this as soon as you can. If you were a fan of Chapter 1 and 2, this is a fine addition.",

While most action movies adopts high-tech fightings with lots of hacking and nerdy conversations, JW is one of the few movies that did the opposite and succeeded. It has all the action scenes that you could ever ask for, both within and beyond your imaginations. The middle of this movie might seem slow to certain audiences, but trust me, its ending will be worth your wait!!!Btw, seeing Keanu Reeves in a fancy suit and does all the magical actions, it's hard to believe that he's 55 already!!!",

They are also just brutal and seems so realistic in someway.When that is said the story isn't great but is isn't bad either. But this movie is more about the action scenes than the story.The acting is great from all the actors in the movie. Halle Berry does a great job playing a strong woman and Keanu reeves plays the role of John Wick better than ever.So if you like action movies you NEED to see this movie",

    "reviewBody": "The best way I can describe the production of the John Wick films is slick. Everything from the direction, camerawork, fight choreography, set design, music and lighting is superbly polished, making it gorgeous to watch. John Wick: Chapter 3 carries this on very effectively.It's just glorious action cinema from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is just a living legend at this point with how he commits fully to the role. Stahelski also rightly gets much praise for how he handles the fight sequences with such grace.Somehow the action has managed to keep on improving from the first instalment, and the brutality is also upped as well, which I didn't think would be possible after what was delivered in Chapter 2.The additions to the cast are also pretty good. Halle Berry is solid, although her character is not involved nearly as much as I thought she was going to be. Mark Dacascos was also great as Zero, who was a worthy foe for John to take on in hand-to-hand combat. The introduction of Asia Kate Dillon as the Adjudicator was also intriguing, as it gave us our first glimpse of the mysterious High Table, which undoubtedly will be explored in further films.Also the world-building is once again on-point, slowly revealing morsels of information about the society of assassins. However, this is also the film's greatest weakness as it expands the world so much that what story there is becomes unfocused.I adore these films, and whilst this is certainly the weakest of the three, it's still a highly-engaging piece. I can't wait to see what they do next, as the prospect of John teaming up with the Bowery King to take on the High Table sounds great in concept.",

    "reviewBody": "Once again Keanu has given us an unfortunate consequence to not passing on a RIDICULOUS script. This movie would have been lower if not for the decent action scenes. Now by all means is it not a clean action scene where you Won't tell it is a 50+ Keanu walking through a very choreographed fight. Sheesh! 75% of the shots were clear as day when telegraphing a strike.\nHale Berry was an unnecessary addition. So was the first act. This script is all over the place. I wasn't sure whether any of the exposition was important for his ties to a Russian smuggling ballet/sombo/smuggling ring since it only showed 15 minutes then was just tossed out like nothing. The over used \"dog\" line felt redundant and unnecessary. World building clearly was a thing Lionsgate is hoping for. Rather than rush details about the \"high table/under the table\" universal rules lets break it down at some point.\nThis movie was too soon, it clearly needed a better script/screen play/ stunt work/ story line/ and laws of what is capable.I liked the first John wick. It provided an almost mystery as to who this guy is and why it was a mistake to double cross him. They took that entity and made him the god damn terminator!!! Literally no risk to reward ratio. So the pay out seems predictable. Stabbed 15 times and no possibility of injury, falls off ten foot ceiling and gets up with no problem.\nJust an overall disappointing addition to the series and it seems like it's taking the place of what the \"Die Hard\" series once was, but it quickly follows that same train wreck.",

    "reviewBody": "This universe, created without any source material, had to develop and expand itself in every new film. The same fiction can not be made for each film. We don't know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.This film offers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of is included in the third film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, there is even a horse escape scene. There's so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer. Only action-oriented films can be considered empty. We can say that John Wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action for 2 hours and 10 minutes. But in doing so, it doesn't forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of John Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe.Stahelski has very impressive shots.The main venues preferred for the main fights were especially appreciated. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Keanu Reeves and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Stahelski deserves great praise.The film also brings new characters. One of them is Sofia, played by Halle Berry. Obviously the audience will love Sofia. Halle Berry has done a great job. Mark Dacascos is one of our main villains; He portrayed the character Zero in the film.Among the action films, it was both a strong story and an ambitious way of action. I think that the action-lovers will be pleasure separated from this film. 9/10",

    "reviewBody": "Sequels normally get worse as they go on... Not John Wick. John Wick movies get more intense with each movie. I don't want to spoil the plot or give away any spoilers but after the first 20 minutes or so i was glad that everything calmed down a little, for a little while anyway, because I was thinking to myself, \"it can't go on like this, I'll have a heart attack\" talk about an adrenaline rush... luckily we got a break from the intense action after around 20 minutes..What a fantastic movie. Yes you do have to suspend disbelief, every other person's an assassin and regular people don't seem to care or react when people get murdered nearby, but that's movie world I suppose. I'll take this over realism any day....",

    "reviewBody": "First let me say, I loved the first 2 films, but they seem to have run out of ideas & storyline. This film is just John Wick on the run with the world's top assassins after him, no other story or character development. From the beginning, it is just dozens of assassins popping out of every doorway, long choreographed fights with JW attacked by a half-dozen goons at a time, lots of shooting & knife-throwing in which he kills them all. That's it. It becomes boring after 20 mins, but goes on for 2 hours of the same with barely a spoken word. The occasional spoken line is delivered woodenly & tiredly. Like I said, absolutely no story or depth of character. Boring.",

The stunt team did its best work of all three movies. Keanu Reeves, Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and all the other stunt men were just beyond great, simply incredible.The story was pretty simple as we got what we expected but also so much more, a bigger/detailed look on how big and unique the world that Derek Kolstad created back in 2014 truly are. It's a perfect story and world for an action movie and the filmmakers behind the movies show it once again here; an unpredictable, suspenseful, terrific and entertaining ride filled with great characters, writing and fight choreography.",

    "reviewTitle": "John Wick is back! Bigger, badder and better than ever before",
    "reviewBody": "If you thought super-assassin, man of few words, dog fan and one man punching bag John Wick had run out of energy after 2 weeks of carnage across John Wick and John Wick 2 then think again, as Wick (aka 54 year old Keanu Reeves) is back bigger, badder and madder than ever to wreak havoc across New York City (and the world) in the Hollywood action romp of the year, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.It's incredible to think of where the Wick brand has come from, from the surprising success of the first film that no one thought would be worth much of a look, through to the more excessive and large-scale 2nd installment that expanded the lore and universe that Wick is a part of, to now full-scale Hollywood budget and flair, John Wick just keeps getting bigger and better.Re-teaming with stunt-man turned director Chad Stahelski, Reeves and his directing partner have ensured that Parabellum (a title that will make sense once you watch the film, trust me) is a film like no other with its completely over the top and highly unbelievable antics needing to be seen to be believed and if my cinema experience is anything to go by, prepare to be wincing, laughing and clapping your way through their gloriously energetic and thrill infused imaginations.With more headshots than a police database, more devilishly entertaining acting turns from a returning main cast plus new additions such as Halle Berry (and some bloodthirsty canines), Angelica Huston, Saïd Taghmaoui, Jerome Flynn and a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos and a collection of actions scenes that involve such things (as I kid you not) classic novels, underwater fights, motor cycle chases, shotgun rampages and horse riding through a busy New York street, there aren't many films like John Wick or many that could even dare to be it.Starting out much the same way as the 2nd installment in the franchise, Parabellum begins in breathtaking fashion with its opening 20 - 30 minutes stanza some of the best your likely to see in 2019 and while it's hard for the film to maintain this hyperactive energy over a two hour plus runtime, it's great to see Stahelski and his leading man maintain a relatively consistent pacing throughout that despite some mid-section slow down, ensures that as it turns the corner into its endgame, we won't barely get a moments respite from the action delights coming our way.At the end of the day everything that happens in Parabellum is unbelievable, silly and often outrageous but John Wick embraces this and runs with it, it knows what it is and is proud of it and this beautifully shot, carefully choreographed and often thrilling exercise is the best example of a Hollywood action film your likely to get, with enough gas left in the tank to suggest that a 4th John Wick adventure is a more than an appealing proposition.Final Say -Once more anchored by a great Keanu Reeves turn and elevated by some incredible feats of action ballet, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an absolute blast from start to finish that further solidifies John Wick's placing in the very best action film franchises of all time.4 library books out of 5",

Here in Wick III Parabellum, we are introduced to acting juggernauts such as Angelica Houston, Halle Berry and action superstars like, Yayan Ruhian From The Raid 1 & 2. The talent in this movie is a cornucopia of true unadulterated actors that obviously want to be part of this franchise. And we the moviegoers are all better off for it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Rating: A-",
    "reviewBody": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise's outstandingly choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.And it's precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What you see, it's what you get.Nowadays, viewers already have their eyes set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I'll never forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of \"of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how can you believe that?! You're such a moron!\" They were roasting one of their friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won't realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.Yes, it's over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge of physics in a few particular moments. But that's the thing: if you're pumped to watch a third film of a franchise, you're a fan. You know what it's about and what's its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound by. It's a bit messier than the first one, but it's still a blast of entertainment.Parabellum has the best of both installments. It has the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work I've ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren't always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don't think they really belong in this saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don't fit this world.Besides that, I don't really have much to complain about. The cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia's dogs are deadly cute, and they steal the show.Regarding the action stunts, they're all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two's mirror room to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect. I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame. You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It's kind of like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it's what my memory triggered. In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences, accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins' world. Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast. Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been the best action movie of the century. \"One of the best\" it's still one hell of a tagline.",

How badass is that? I'll tell you how much: ALL of the badass.Parabellum begins the action almost immediately and doesn't let up. Even when it does slow down, it doesn't feel like it, because it does a deep dive into John's backstory; but since the filmmakers are masters of \"if you can show it, don't say it,\" even exposition & world building flows right along with the full throttle pacing of the rest of the movie.Halle Berry steals the show, 100%. I want a full movie solely about her character, Sophia...no...I want a complete trilogy. She's so incredible in her action scenes, that she makes John's feel almost boring. She's just as good as John Wick, but boiling over with ferocity, and with an added skill that trumps John completely.Asia Kate Dillon's character, The Adjudicator, is a force of nature; a storm that brings death & chaos everywhere they go. While they may not be a fighter, they are an insane villian that'd fit perfectly in a Batman movie.The action itself is filmed with such precision, with long takes, that you feel like you accidentally walked directly into the mayhem. It's a sight to behold.The John Wick universe is far from over, and I couldn't be happier.",

    "reviewTitle": "Really Good If Not Quite Great Wick Outing",
    "reviewBody": "Undoubtedly a big money franchise there is also something compelling about John Wick. He's the most un-defeattable underdog I've ever seen. Sorry Luke Skywalker. We don't really know what his power source is unlike you. So in the third installment we pick up with Wick being marked for deletion with a huge bounty by that mondo organization whose thing is robot-like loyalty.It doesn't take long for the action to begin as it should since this isn't \"On Golden Pond\". And when it begins it just keeps coming. This is playing a bit to lowest common denominator because its the scenes in between where this film really is interesting. The characters of Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne, Lance Reddick, and Angelica Huston make the story rise above the fights which honestly are so plentiful and well staged they kind of get lost after a while. Then there's two special characters that doll out the ominous decisions from which everything kind of springs forth. They are \"the adjudicator\" and \"the elder\". The elder, though interesting is milk toast compared to the imposing adjudicator played by Asia Dillon. You kind of hang on and hope for the up-commence of her character as she imposes the rules and regulations of fealty with evil impunity. This is a good performance.I'm tiring of the fights although I must say it hasn't been done better and the motorcycle scenes are truly over-the -top. It's all a big video game like to a kind of generic middle-ground Sci-Fi/drama thing. Still impressive. But past all of the action it's the character who make John Wick still a thing. In spite of the technical prowess I'm pretty much just in for the characters and the fact Wick seems to be unable to die. We are hit squarely with an ending that promises another installment. I do recommend this but I want more of the character and story in the next one please - because I know I'll get the action as that is a given.",

Someone appears to have forgotten to write a storyline except he's on the run with a £14M bounty on his head and has to kill as many people as possible in as many different ways.I've had a cinema unlimited card for the past 2 years and seen about 130 films (normally 5/6 a month) and I've seen some rubbish in those 130, but nothing quite as bad as this and I reckon it will be a while till I see something as bad again.Even Halle Berry and Ian McShane couldn't save this one.",

    "reviewBody": "A few minutes after the movie began, John is in a narrow hall full of antiques fighting an infinite amount of people and throwing antique knives. The scene is so kinetic that raise your adrenaline level and keep you holding your breath (quit difficult thing because on top of the ultra violence, the scene became darkly funny and force you to laugh). This is just one scene of the many action pieces this movie has. It is not the most spectacular but is going to blow your mind and body. Do not expect to find anything remotely close on a Marvel/Disney movie. This is really excellent action, play by real actors not the boring and (really bad) digital fights on the Avengers movies.\nAs much action and violence this movie has (which is more than all this year's movies combined) the script department was a bit disappointing. I was really expecting a little more development. I am glad anyway they leave it open for Chapters 4; but I comes faster than Chapter 3.\nIn terms of acting; Keanu, Ian McShane,Lance Reddick, Fishburne deliver their characters with great charisma and wit. Halle Berry is always excellent as an action star and I hope her character comes back. Marc Dacascos still has the moves but deserves a better written character. But the stunts and doubles are the best ; they really deserve Oscars even when their faces are rarely shown.\nIn brief; minimu story (which basically was the norm this year with most of the blockbusters), but extremely well crafted cinematography and action scenes with a bit of fun.",

The second movie went downhill and seemed to be just an excuse for staging way too many improbable fight sequences. And now with the final movie they've decided that a plot isn't really necessary as long as there are lots of fight sequences. It's one of the few movies I wanted to get up and leave, but I stuck it out. I can always tell if I'm bored at a movie by the number of times I check my watch to see how much time is left, and I did that way too many times for this movie. This is definitely my last John Wick movie...",

    "reviewBody": "\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" proves that this franchise is untouchable. A master-class in action films. Keanu Reeves keeps getting better and better.In this third instalment of the action franchise, John Wick is on the run after a 14$ million price tag is on his head, and everywhere he turns he is being hunted.A thoroughly violent, gritty, mind-blowing film that will have you howling at the screen. \"John Wick 3\" is beyond fast paced and features epic kills and I've never loved dogs so much as I did in this film. Your jaw will drop. The action choreography is gold on its own; you've never seen anything like it. What else is there to say? Reeves is a God and cannot he stopped. It looks like a bright future is ahead for the John Wick franchise and I can't wait for more. Go see it.A must-see action extravaganza.",

    "reviewBody": "As of 5/17/2019, I can confidently say that \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is easily my favorite movie of 2019 so far and it's become my favorite film franchise; there are so many ways they can continue this story and I wouldn't be surprised if a few spin-offs come from this...they've essentially built their own universe and I can't wait to see were it goes from here. I've never been a HUGE Keanu Reeves fan (I don't hate him either) but, man, he was born for this role. I loved everything about this film: the fight choreography (AMAZING), the story/world building, Halle Berry, the camera work, the use of lighting, the set pieces, Halle Berry, the chase scenes, and Halle Berry (did I say that already?). Even the animals had a moment in the spotlight (when you see it, you'll know what I mean 🐕 🐎). If you're in to fast-paced action films as I am, you do NOT want to miss this...I strongly recommend this film.\nNote: Make sure you watch the first 2 chapters because it's all connected.",

    "reviewBody": "The third Chapter is utterly incredible. Like the second film, Chapter 3 expands on the mythology and world-building, opening up the world John inhabits even wider. The more we learn about this assassin underground, the more preposterously complex it grows. And yet, there's always thought put into things, to the point where even the grandest absurdities have their own kind of logic. It makes for a highly enjoyable world that we want to spend more time in, and learn more about. That's the true brilliance of this franchise. To just have John killing off people, with no real meaning, would get old fast. But by constantly expanding this heightened reality, we can't help but get drawn deeper and deeper into this Wonderland, tumbling down a rabbit hole, waiting to see where it all goes. By the time John Wick: Chapter 3 ends, you'll be almost as exhausted as John Wick himself. And just like him, you'll be ready to come back for more.",

    "reviewBody": "A perfect action film.Each instalment of John Wick has been an improvement on the last but without deviating from the winning formula that makes the films stand-out from everything else being made at the moment and they hark back to the great action films of the 80's/early 90's.\nI know that mindless action films aren't for everybody and I certainly wouldn't recommend the John Wick films to everybody but for fans of the genre classics such as Terminator, Commando, Die Hard, Kickboxer, Point Break, etc. The Wick films are clear spiritual successors that will be cherished by fans of any of the aforementioned films and I can't recommend them highly enough.\nCheck-list for a classic action film:-\nA plot that can be summed in one sentence? Check.\nOne-dimensional characters with clear motives? Done.\nAction? Check.\nMore action. Check.\nA love interest who gets only enough screen time to humanise our unstoppable. revenge/justice seeking, death machine? Check.\nAnything else? More action.\nIf the above list doesn't appeal -- Then don't watch John Wick. There are plenty of other films out there.\nIf you want depth, character development and story-telling then read a good book, it's a better medium for it and they bog down the pace of a good action film where pacing is more important than depth, choreography is more important than character development and the story is only used to get the hero from one set-piece to the next.\nParabellum is a relentless, switch-off your brain and have fun film. It's ridiculous in the best ways, loud and violent from start to finish and I enjoyed it immensely.\nIf you haven't seen the first two, I'd recommend catching up before watching the newest instalment but I'm fairly confident newcomers to the series will pick up what's going on, or they won't, I don't think it's integral to revel in the majesty that is John Wick.\nIf you've ever watched 'Commando' or 'The Running Man' and thought to yourself 'They don't make films like that anymore', I can assure you...\nThey do.",

    "reviewTitle": "A \"Threequel\" With Extraordinarily Choreographed Action",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick is back, and the third film in the franchise combines impressive action and world-building to create a unique blend of neo-noir thrills that fans of this series will probably really enjoy. \"John Wick: Chapter 3--Parabellum\" is not without its imperfections, but the film has much to like about it. The film picks up pretty much just after where the second film left off, as Wick is about to be designated \"excommunicado\" with a $14 million bounty on his head for killing someone in a Continental Hotel near the end of the second film, which is strictly prohibited if blood is spilled in the hotel. This film contains incredibly impressive and visceral action scenes that incorporate all types of action techniques, from bare-knuckle fights to gun-fu to motorcycle chasing and more. The action is so intense that you will leave the theater a bit exhausted (in a good way,) and the last time I felt that way after watching a movie was back when I saw \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" in theaters four years ago. Thankfully, the film's trailers don't spoil much of the best action that the film has to offer. The sheer stylization and choreography of all the action is truly astonishing, as is the film's inspirations that manage to span the globe--which include traditional Russian ballet all the way to \"The Raid\"-style fight sequences from Indonesian cinema.Also impressive in the film is the sense of world-building present, as the mythology of what it's like to be an assassin in the \"John Wick\" universe is fleshed out here in far more detail. The scenes set inside the Continental are stunningly shot and lit, and helps provide context surrounding the action that we see. Occasionally, the film's narrative can almost be too reliant on its action sequences. This is not a huge burden on the film given just how impressive the action is, but it still does work to the actual plot line's detriment in some way. The other criticism I have of the film is that it could have used dialogue to further develop the characters and plot more. While the \"John Wick\" films have always been known for primarily focusing on action over dialogue, the writing that exists in the film is often somewhat redundant in nature when you consider that key plot details spoken in the film's dialogue are often clearly conveyed during one of the many action scenes. That said, those who enjoy this franchise will certainly get a genuine thrill out of watching this film on the big screen. 7.5/10",

The only thing it gets 10/10 for is being worse than John Wick 2 if that was possible ? Well it was and they succeeded !So if you like your films to be an unintelligible tattoo convention with shoot em up first and third person shooter video game then this is the one for you - good luck .If you like gratuitous violence you'll love this - lots of knife throwing , lots of exploding heads and very little dialogue , plot or cohesion - then this is for you .The influences were clear - add the cast and more than a touch of matrix , a bit of blade runner , a big Wolfenstein 3d , doom and you've got it .There were however a few minutes of actual calm where you felt - yes this could get better - but they didn't last long .It is possible to make a video game film actually enjoyable and with a plot take Assassins Creed for example - and the first John Wick film was good but this was bad and if you didn't like John Wick 2 you'll hate this as it's worse .But maybe it's a marmite film like Blade from 20 years ago with Wesney Snipes there are people out there who loved it - I thought it was awful - we can't all like the same films - if this is your type of film enjoy - I'm sorry but I had to walk out it was just going nowhere for me .Pad.A 2/10",

    "reviewBody": "When the original came out in 2014 it was a sleeper hit for sure. It had fantastically choreographed gun play that you could tell was directed by stunt men. It was stylish, cool, and had an air of ambiguity about the world John used to be a part of. The characters were fantastic, despite not fully knowing about them.The second one was a bit of a let down overall. It had some decent action, but the drive behind the movie that the first had was lost and I didn't care for it from a storytelling perspective. But it was still enjoyable from a non-stop action standpoint. The story with John owing that guy a favor really wasn't as intriguing as the first's set-up of the universe. The 2nd almost showed too much of their secret world.I wasn't as interested to see the third after the previous one wasn't as compelling. But I figured I'd see John Wick to the end anyways.This one is definitely a step up from the second movie, but it still lacking the narrative to make it fully compelling. Sure, these movies AREN'T going to be a storytelling masterpiece. These movies are about the practical action and pretty much that.The story in this one is essentially John is on the run after breaking the a cardinal rule of the assassin world. He goes to various people from his past to get help, but in the background a messenger from the controlling board of the assassins visits each person who helped John throughout the past movie. It's a compelling enough story to help showcase the amazing action scenes, but it's not as interesting as the first movie was.There is a lull in the middle where John goes to the desert to find a special person that just seemed so unneeded. They could have cut that out and made the movie a bit more compact. Especially when he agrees to something, then literally goes back on the agreement 10 minutes later.This movie is about the action set pieces and it excels in those. Many of them I still have no idea how they did them. It is a masterpiece when it comes to that aspect. Some of the fist fight scenes do feel like they go on a little too long, especially one towards the end with a duo of Asian actors.Most of the fights you have to leave realism outside before watching them, but they're still really entertaining in the long run.JW3 continues the streak of having some of the best movie action ever filmed, so see it on that merit. I still think that JW1 is still the best overall as it has a much more compelling plot and better set of characters.",

Yea, story or Keanu as an actor arent the gold masterpiece of acting/writing (personally i dont like how Keanu is speaking, how he interacts with people - he is fair but he isnt so much enjoyable in dialogues. But i love Keanu as a human being). But the WHOLE movie is absolutely staggering. This series is destroying every boundaries and its obvious this is Stahelski´s lifetime project. He became an absolute supremo of so called \"Modern B action flick\". Stahelski isnt boring, isnt cheap. He thinks, he brainstorms, he WANTS YOU TO HAVE FUN. Parrabelum is SO MANY MILE AHEAD from the second chapter. As expected , deeper background of EVERYTHING (backstory of Wick himself, High Table, universe expansion).\nChapter 2 was the worst from this trilogy, third part is the best because is not so linear , predictable and non-enjoyable (for multiple viewings) as second or first part. Technically, its the best action movie ever since Matrix (in way of inventive elements.)\nMUST SEE..",

What works in film's favour are breathtaking action sequences, especially a scene in a horse's stable and on a bridge (overpass) with Wick fighting off bikers. It is expertly directed and edited. John Wick is still as mean as ever. What doesn't work in film's favour is the following: nonexistent script or a poor attempt of a story and the fact that it doesn't end as a trilogy. There is a scene that I would've made differently, when Wick is in a desert looking for a way out, in that particular moment he would start hallucinating because of dehydration, be under illusion of seeing his dead wife Helen, looking gently at him and as soon as he'd reach his hand towards her, she'd disappear. When this film first came out, a sequel was obvious and expected. I have been looking forward to seeing this third chapter for a long time and now after watching it, I only hope for a better developed screenplay and characterisation in a fourth chapter.

    "reviewTitle": "It's Not A Masterpiece, But Keanu Is Masterful In this Role",
    "reviewBody": "The John Wick franchise, like Fast and the Furious is one of those franchises you have to grade on the quality of the action rather than the quality of its story. Neither of the first two John Wick films had a remarkable story, so the John Wick experience is really about enjoying one of the greatest action stars of his generation doing what he does best in the most creative of ways--killing bad guys. Killing lots of them.For the third installment in the John Wick franchise, Keanu Reeve's and Halle Berry guarantee you will not survive any drinking game based on their character's kill counts. If you thought John Wick killed a lot of people in the first two movies, then you're going to need a calculator for this gun-fu ode to Bruce Lee's Game of Death. Keanu continues to master the art of injury-limping through his films and finding the energy necessary to eviscerate one guy after the next. He's done it so much throughout his career that you sometimes fail to appreciate how talented he is as a real action star during some of his scenes--you expect it. That's not a knock on him, that's a tribute to how good Keanu is at these types of roles.What was a surprise was Halle Berry's fantastic sequence of kills that looked like the spawning of her own franchise with the intensity and length of her fight sequence. Anyone who's ever tried to collect alimony from Halle Berry should seriously try to reimburse her after seeing this. She was gloriously vicious in this movie.The opening scene's kill in the library was without a doubt, the movie bad guy kill of the year in a movie full of award-winning fatalities (if there were such a thing). It's a franchise brimming over with mind-numbing violence that still finds ways to always make you squeamish.One of two problems with John Wick 3 is the organizational structure of the fight scenes. You expect a movie to open strong, settle down, and build to a crescendo. Unfortunately, some of the best fights happen earlier in the film, leaving the ending fight filling a bit anti-climatic. The other is a lost opportunity to use to more moments of humor to liven up a movie that occasionally becomes so repetitive that you're just waiting for it to end. One of my favorite scenes from the first John Wick film was John killing multiple guys in his home and having the police stop by and totally ignore it like it was just another day in this neighborhood. Moments of levity mixed with action are the hallmarks of this franchise. This movie gets it half right and that's not an entirely bad thing, because the other half is what John Wick fans came for--Keanu Reeves reminding you that he is the best action star in the world.",

    "reviewBody": "The man. The myth. The legend. Will somebody please, get this man a: pistol, shotgun, throwing knife, belt, sword, book, motorcycle and a horse. Because in a year of lacklustre releases, John Wick has come to save the day yet again. Oh yes! Being declared \"excommunicado\" results in a barrage of relentless well-choreographed action sequences that rivals its predecessors and action milestones such as 'The Raid 2', whilst also providing an in depth exploration of the assassin world that he resides in. Stahelski's franchise, from a revenge thriller to action extravaganza, has progressed substantially. For the better, might I add. Immediately after the events of the second film, John Wick is on the run from an endless wave of assassins after a ludicrously rewarding contract is put on his head.He has overcome vengeance, broken the rules of The Continental and is now succumbing to desperation. The clock is ticking. The assassins are preparing. Ready yourself for one of the best first acts this year (or any year for that matter!). Stahelski immediately injects his neo-noir aesthetic within the immediate second of John Wick running for his life. Vivid neon lights refracting from the harsh rainfall. The suspicious activity of passersby. Six o'clock hits. Showtime! The sheer ferocity of violence welcomes Mr. Wick as he is sublimely throwing daggers into skulls, destroying a jaw with just a book and politely using a horse to kick the absolute excrement out of others. Ooh. Aah. Ouch!Stahelski's signature eye for stunt work is unparalleled. Exhilarating long takes showcasing Reeves' physical prowess as he throws himself into every exciting sequence. Utilising various different pieces of equipment to inventively slay the opposition. An absurd amount of bone-crunching, skull-mashing and eye-popping that is enhanced due to the brilliant sound effects team. Even the gunshots made me clinch my chest, fooling me into thinking a bullet penetrated my heart. A refreshing sequence involving Berry's Sofia, an assassin who must help Wick, proves that Stahelski can balance multiple characters in the same action sequence. This also includes two vicious dogs that tear the enemy apart. A symphony of violence, where every component comes together perfectly.Both Reeves and Berry give physically demanding performances, with the former looking exhausted by the third act (a subtle detail I really appreciated), whilst also presenting a nuanced set of emotions. We all know Reeves is no Day-Lewis, and the writers avoid the sentimental moments for a more angered approach instead, working in his favour. A plethora of other characters, ranging from assassins to members of the High Table, are well introduced and remained memorable throughout.Is the third instalment perfect? Unfortunately not. Naturally in an action film, there are down times where the story simmers and allows the audience to catch a breath. These moments lulled too much in my opinion, considering the extensive runtime, and should've been shortened to keep the pace tighter. A sequence involving John Wick traversing a desert seemingly paused the film for a somewhat unusual part of the story that felt out of place. Then there's the ending. You're either on board with it or not, especially the plausibility of a certain fall. For me, I'm more inclined to tilt towards the former but understandably it will divide viewers. Occasionally the CGI can be noticeable, and will take you out of the action for the minuscule of seconds. However admittedly I'm nitpicking here.John Wick has to be one of the most consistent franchises available. Each instalment attempts to increase the carnage and stunt work. And it works. Whilst the lengthy runtime is questionable in places, Stahelski's third chapter is definitely \"preparing for war\" and I cannot wait to see how the story progresses. Reeves is the man. But John Wick is the hero!",

    "reviewBody": "Just caught this movie! Man!!! Keanu walks the walk, talks the (Keanu) talk and fights the fight! I loved this movie! The editing along with the stylistic screenplay tailored to what makes a Keanu movie \"Keanu'esque\" which makes his fans enjoy his movies is a formula, I believe, has been thoroughly perfected by the John Wick Franchise. Special praise here for Derek Kolstad who wrote the screenplay (I believe with two other writers?). What may be well known is that Kolstad wrote the script for John Wick (little trivia: the title character is named after Kolstad's grandfather, which Keanu suggested) The choreography of the fight sequences - man! Keanu nails it. Even though most look like straight out of graphic novels, its polished and sharp. I was so glad to see Halle Berry (its been a while since I last saw her in a movie) but man! She's still got it in her! Just like Keanu, Halle too appears ageless!! She's superb and amazing in this movie - loved her action sequences. Keanu was a revelation! He carries off that detached wryness with a zen-like poise that's his trademark signature with an unmistakably effortless style. I personally feel John Wick 3 is the best in the series, I liked it more than the previous two. So for which, I feel this movie definitely deserves a full ten stars!!",

    "reviewBody": "The movie starts off strong with some great fights, but then it drops off into what seems endless story. When the action picks up again the fights seem to go on way too long, and are very repetitive. Some of the long fights at the end are amazingly choreographed though. I will say this as, I hated it when in a fight the guy(s) can kill John they stop and give him another chance to kill them (not die) it happens several times. I also hated that at one point John basically begs for his life - John bows to no man who threatens him. In the first two movies the fights are exaggerated but have a strong sense of realism to them (that's what makes them awesome), this movie (in the end fights) begins to slide towards the ridiculous. I think this franchise should've ended here, got a real feeling the writers are trying to squeeze out more than they should from this storyline. Definitely my least favorite of the three, I think the forth one will not be any better.",

Oh yes it is:\nWick(ed) will be served to you, and Wick(ed) will be at your service.The premise of the movie resides on two clean-cut rules and absolute categories:\n1. Follow the rules, or otherwise face the consequences (when referring to the system i.e. association of underground organizations)\n2. Love thy loved ones, and be ready to suffer for them (when referring to the values of oneself i.e., the main hero, John Wick).But, clean-cut rules work perfectly only in games and strategies.\nIn real life all is fair in love, and especially in war. In times of war, anything goes. And the absolute rules can result in catastrophic consequences from (somewhat) bizarre mistakes (like getting all fussed over a car scratch which is a reference to the second sequel). This becomes evident throughout the movie (not that the movie carried for plots and consistencies). And it is demonstrated in such a brutal, visceral, yet artful way. This Wick(ed) esthetics of binding together two contrasting categories (i.e., violence which can best be described as \"a beautiful mess\") evokes conflicting emotions. Those feelings will evoke lasting memories and this is guaranteed success for the billboards.",

The fight choreography is fantastic and creative in its choice of weaponry (including the use of some animals in unexpectedly awesome ways). This is a threequel that's as thrilling, over-the-top and gratifying as fans of John Wick could hope for. I'm thinking he's back.",

    "reviewBody": "The movie started right where the last one ended. There was no time wasted and we jumped right into the action. If you're a fan of action movies, this is for you. The movie moved along quickly. The story was there but it was barely holding everything together. Mainly this movie was about great shootouts, and fight choreography, mixed in with small moments of dialogue to keep the party going.\nThe shootouts were great! The fight choreography was also great... in the beginning. Then something happened halfway through where it felt like the fight choreography was happening in slow motion. It was very noticeable, to the point where the fighting was starting to get predictable. What I mean by that is that the fights started to become less fluid. In Jackie Chan's films everything is high speed, tight, and fluid. Here it felt a little clunky, as if the actors were waiting to get punched or thrown.\nOne of the strong points of this movie were it's sets. Every set was full of color, and detail. What I mean by detail is that every theme looked just right. If you take a moment to look at all of the objects on set, or the buildings, everything looked like it belonged. It was perfect no matter what location John Wick was. One second, it's dark and seedy, then next the screen is filled with bright and warm colors. They did a great job creating themes based on the locations.\nSo, should you watch it or skip it? If you like action movies with crazy shootouts and fights, little to no story line then I'd say WATCH IT! This movie is definitely for you. I give it a solid 7/10. Would I buy it? nah. Would I rent it to see it again? Definitely.",

He gets some limited help at certain times, but overall John has to fend for himself.More action than you need in any one sitting, I'm rating John Wick a 8/10. Would have been 9/10 if not for some pretty big inconsistencies in Continental providing amnesty to John (unresolved, there are aways... consequences... but we don't find out), and the one other criticism is the motives of the combatants in the drawn out final fight is extremely unclear. Are you killing each other or not? Other than that, John Wick Chapter 3 is one bloody gory ride that meets expectations if that's what your looking for.",

It has way more set pieces than the pervious two movies and puts Wick on the defensive for 90% of its runtime. Keanu deserves a ton of praise for the success of the movie as his physical dedication to the character is turned up to 11 for this movie.Halle Berry gets to show off all her training even if she plays a smaller role than I would have thought. The cinmetography is surprisingly great. Overall this movie is 9/10 and my rating scale does not cross genres, so as an action movie this is a close to perfect as you can get. My only complaint is the ending but I won't spoil it here. So if you like the first two you will love this, so sit back for 2 hours of beautiful mayhem.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is not romance, drama, sci-fi. Is pure solid non-stop action. Do You like action movies? you cannot miss this one. I really like the first chapter ( oh! ) but this sequel was so good that takes the crown of the trilogy. Terrific choreographies, very nice rythm, very good music score and right amount of humor. A masterpiece of action movies. Good enough to get from you smiles of joy. How many times you can say that from an assasins movie? Very few for sure. A bonus: Do you like dogs? You'll be sooo happy.",

    "reviewBody": "There is nothing that you would not expect from the movie with Keanu Reeves. Quality acting. The extremely well-done fight choreography. Funny and cruel jokes/kills. The last part sometimes it feels like you are watching Mortal Kombat fights with an epic \"Finish Him\" sequence, around almost every corner. And the specific fight/gore humor is at the same sadistic level as in previous movies. They might even push it up a notch or two.If you are a fan of the previous John Wick movies. Go watch it. You will not be disappointed. I feel I am a bit spoiled with the epic proportions of the Avengers last movie. So I am bit tempted to rate it less than 10. But the movie is really good and it stands it's ground firmly.",

It's an action movie so your expectation are not high, but still the movie started as expected with a bang, lots of action and fighting and even more violence than before. All is well, but at half the movie I think they had a revelation, that they can milk the cow some more and then is when is all going downhill, the action is just repetitive and boring and at the end you just feel annoyed that yet again, they added fillers just so that they take your money one more time. And no John Wick, I will not be coming for the fourth,fifth whatever chapter. So final thoughts, 0 story, with that story the actors couldn't do much so you can add bad acting to the mix and lots of action, after the first half John is so bad at fighting his enemies are waiting for him to enter the fight.",

    "reviewTitle": "Parabellum : Reviewed",
    "reviewBody": "John Wick 3 Parabellum : Reviewed\nThere is something helplessly alluring about the way Keanu Reeves moves while fighting. He is not very fast like the traditional Asian martial artists; yet he is just so un-friggin-believable. And that's what the whole John Wick franchise rests upon so heavily; Crazy and impeccably well choreographed fight sequences (Which is like a symphony of sorts for a martial artist buff like me) and Keanu performing them. Like a breeze.\nThe 3rd installment of the Baba Yaga (John Wick) universe titled Parabellum (simply means 'Prepare for War') takes us a little deeper into the world of assassins and the High table (The global underworld) which was touched upon in the 2nd part. The movie begins right where the 2nd film wrapped up. John wick is the most wanted Man in the world with a booty of 14 Mn USD on his life. And he evades that. He kills his way through countless number of master assassins to stay alive. The body, blade and bullet count here will drive you nuts.\nThe world of the continental and the High table gets a lot more alluring with the addition of a few more characters and locations. We are introduced to 'The elder one' who is above the High Table who has his base in the deserts of Morocco. Then there is an adjudicator. Well, who adjudicates. And we are introduced to a manager of the Continental Morocco (Halle Berry, Sophia). That apart from the old characters. The Dog. Winston and ofcourse, the Doctor.\nParabellum goes all Guns blazing with it's extreme action choreography; something Chad Stahelski loves to do. The writing is crisp keeping in mind the subtle humour and minimal dialogue for Mr. Wick.\nThere are horses, dogs, bikes, swords, knives and ofcourse, armour piercing shot gun rounds. Several East Asian guys are added to the mix to offer us mouth watering and awe inspiring fight sequences. And Mr. Wick kicks ass. You can't help but go bonkers about Keanu Reeves.\nThis is also a reunion of sorts for The Matrix team.\nThe climax is deliciously twisted to keep everyone guessing.\nAs the movie comes to an end, the words of Mr. Wick from the 2nd film keep lingering around; 'Tell them. Tell them all. I will kill them all'.\npsk",

John Wick 3 is a stunning movie, with great action scenes almost all the time, leaving no room for boring talk and uninteresting narratives. It has all the good traits of its predecessors, and adds new ones. The scenes seem uncutted, and Keanu is just awesome as always. The sound editing makes the shots, kicks, punches and knife cuts even more interesting, specially with the non-soundtrack fight scenes. An adrenaline packed movie for those who want a truly action experience. We want a 4th one!",

Few of them are really long and feel like going on and on and on but damn who is complaining. Bring it on. The climax hand to hand kung fu fights are freakin brilliant. I thought this one was the last in the triology but they set up the premise for another sequel in the climax and i can't wait to see the next chapter.

    "reviewBody": "Chad Stahelski has officially established himself as a prominent director. As expected, the action scene choreography, camera work and the semi-cyberpunk atmosphere are a solid step up from previous instalments. Unfortunately for the fans of the first John Wick movie, this one does not establish John as a semi-realistic and vulnerable character: while the ongoing fight-scenes are a great fun, the suspension of disbelief really kicks in after the second act. The acting is good, the writing is mediocre (it serves just one purpose - to drive the action scenes of the movie, nothing more). The flaws of the movie, however, are greatly compensated by the great overall technical execution of the film.\nIt seems that Lionsgate decided to turn this franchise with its main character into a cash-cow, postponing the conclusion of John Wicks story-arc for the future films, which is not a bad thing if they manage to keep the quality at this level.",

Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.",

    "reviewTitle": "Anorexic Weak Mess",
    "reviewBody": "By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. It's hard to determine, but maybe \"Morbius\" won the prize for the weakest film in SSU (Sony's Universe) and honestly it does with ease.Leto is \"okay\" in the role of Michael Morbius, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. Matt Smith is the one who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90% similar to the previous two \"Venom\" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.The effects are pretty...how to say it...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Let's not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in 2020, initially before \"No Way Home\". However, I'm not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra 2 years time, because...well I'll leave that to you.The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to understand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, don't expect too much, because you'll be disappointed.Morbius is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly. Unfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the \"Venom\" movies. Honestly, I don't have high hopes for neither \"Kraven\" or \"Madame Web\". The standard is pretty low.The film is mediocre and feels like something straight from 2006, with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some dollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.I can say that the best...or rather the stupidest they have left for the end. I mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.",

The Amazing Spider-Man had good bits, and Venom was fun, but Morbius experience came across as a chore.I thought Jared Leto wasn't bad, and actually held himself back a bit (unlike say Tom Hardy who went all out with Venom). Matt Smith looked like he was having fun also.Visuals were patchy, but had some interesting parts.

    "reviewTitle": "Oddly, Logically Reasonable Superhero Story",
    "reviewBody": "It's pretty rare for me to see superhero movies with a great logical explanation for their superpower through sci-fi. This Morbius (2022) has a lil bit blown my mind with their scientific explanation and great delivery which is convincing enough to think if Morbius's superpower is possibly happening. One of the Greatest Scientists and a Nobel Prize Repellent, Dr. Michael Morbius struggle to find the cure for his incurable disease for his fellow sufferer. Then, he has found the cure through bat vampire blood with great superhuman power but costing uncontrollable body and mind. Long story short, this movie is about the introduction of Morbius's superpower and most of the storyline is about controlling his superpower.The pros are suitable pace which is not too fast or too slow, great logical explanation through a Lil bit of sci-fi, and a clear storyline through simple story explanation. My odd POV, I thought this movie a lil bit reminded me about the chars from The Twilight Saga, especially The Volturi. The Volturi char seems to have a similar appearance to Morbius through the same haircut and vampire ambiance lol. The cons are incomparable to other superhero movies and standard quality for overall including visual, ex: CGI. This movie didn't about a superhero typical plot in which superheroes fight the villain from a threatening world. It even didn't about fighting a very difficult or a very strong villain which makes this movie didn't qualify enough as a superhero movie. But both of that reason is typical of Sony Spider-Man Universe like Venom movies. This is also the main reason why Morbius has been made to synchronize with Spider-Man, Venom, and upcoming movie through the different universes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) which consist of the Avengers.Overall, this movie is just good and okay. It's worth it if didn't expect any expectations of a superhero movie. Maybe it felt like Venom movies but tbh I'd rather choose Venom lol. Lastly, there are two post-credit and pretty important if wondered how the universe collides with the Spider-Man.",

    "reviewTitle": "Boring",
    "reviewBody": "Some scenes can be potential and should be developed for the plot but the execution feel rushed. That's what makes this movies's duration is kind of short and even boring. Jared Leto's acting is quite helping this movie. For the others looks quite descent. Maybe because they don't get much portion for thier roles. For CGI, They did great things\nfor the fighting scenes but for special effects on actors faces looks basic. I quite love the scores, especially Michael Morbius's theme. Rating is also big influence for some scenes in this movie. With PG-13, some scenes seems lost lot of atmosphere. Morbius should be depicted as scary and sadistic. In this movie, he depicted as less than in the comic. As happened in the previous two Venom movies.Overall this movie is \"light\" and just an filler movie for another Sony's big project in the future. I don't know what they plan next but Morbius is part of their plan. Let's hope Sony learns something and fix its for their next movies. I'm not recommend this movies but if you are fan of Morbius and Sony Cinematic Universe, you can watch it.",

    "reviewTitle": "I'm BEGGING you, please make Rated R movies",
    "reviewBody": "Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: \"The action was gibberish.\" You couldn't see anything.I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be \"a good guy,\" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have to ask, what were they thinking?",

    "reviewBody": "\"Morbius\" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that \"Morbius\" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",

    "reviewTitle": "two of us against many",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who has devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born with. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who previously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past work tells you what you need to know.An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around the water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire bats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure. All of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their deteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr. Nikolis (Jared Harris, \"Mad Men\").Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as \"The Living Vampire\", so we kinda know where things are headed. It's a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his characterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and Morbius' love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). You've probably guessed that the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI agents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to the high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and it's the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the 'hey, I like this superhuman power' Milo.The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the story, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in years. Sure, the film's release has been delayed a couple of years, but that's no excuse for what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his scenes. We do wish for more of Martine's story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of the SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. It's clear this film's mission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, I believe it's fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication where the sequel is headed.Opening in theaters April 1, 2022.",

    "reviewTitle": "Moody Jared and Manic Matt",
    "reviewBody": "Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) and his friend Lucien a.k.a. Milo (Matt Smith) first met twenty five years ago in a hospital where they were both being treated for a rare blood disease. Their doctor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) noted Michael's exceptional intellect and sent him off for further studies. Presently, Michael has become a brilliant doctor and scientist who had been able to develop life-saving artificial blood which earned him a Nobel Prize.Working on the anti-thrombotic elements of the saliva of vampire bats he had collected from Costa Rica, Michael invented a drug which could cure the affliction he (and Milo) suffered from. However, because human trials were illegal for such substances, he conspired with his girlfriend Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to inject the serum into him on a ship on international waters. The terrifying effects were not what they were expecting.Morbius was a character from Marvel Comics that I had no idea about. This was a Sony release, like the original Spider-Man and adjacent characters like Venom and Carnage, and so it won't be directly connected with main Marvel Cinematic Universe which is under Disney. There is controversy among fans how Sony was confusing the story arc of the MCU, like seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the closing credits of \"Venom.\"Being his origin story, we see how Morbius met his best friend and blood brother Milo, and how his bold experiments had brought their friendship into the next level. Jared Leto played Morbius all moody, broody, and mired in his moral predicament, in sharp contrast with Matt Smith (best known as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor in \"Doctor Who\" and Prince Philip in \"The Crown\") who played Milo all loud, gleeful and manic.Aside from the vampiric transformations, CG effects ranged from subtle (like his ear wiggling for echolocation) to bombastic (like his high-speed wave forms tinged with bright colors from his clothing). Director Daniel Espinosa effectively created an atmosphere of dread and horror, but kept things within a PG rating. A character last seen in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" appeared in the closing credits scenes hinting a Multiverse connection. 6/10.",

Matt Smith was great in his role and Leto was decent in it too. Stop hating it just cause of the company that produces it (remember they made no way home!) they changed a few things regarding Spider-Man stuff from the trailer but they seem to have a plan with it all and I'll trust them till I see the future of it cause I'm not small minded.

    "reviewTitle": "Thoroughly entertaining, unfairly criticized",
    "reviewBody": "I'm shocked by the negativity surrounding this movie. This is an engaging, entertaining time. Don't believe the harsh criticism. This movie is a fun, thrilling and at times pretty scary addition to the marvel universe. Jared Leto is surprisingly good in this role and I'm optimistic about how Morbius will be integrated in a larger Spider-Man story. The poor critical appraisals are reminiscent of Venom, which did very well at the box office and has many fans. I actually loved this movie and can't wait for a sequel. I'd wager 90% of the hate being spread on the internet is coming from people who haven't even seen the movie. Overall a fantastic introduction to a fascinating character. The 2 mid-credits scenes were very unexpected and affects the long term box office viability for the SSU. What I do find interesting is the multiverse implications and whether or not Andrew Garfield will be the SSU's Spider-Man, facing off against Tom Hardy's Venom/the sinister 6. The formation of the latter was hinted at in the mid credit scenes of Morbius. While there clearly seems to have been some production/editing/delay issues, it didn't feel like a soulless cash grab, at least to me. There does seem to be a larger payoff that's being built towards, which is cool. Now that a larger Spider-Man story has been alluded to, the interconnectedness of the movies will drive Spider-Man fans to see every release regardless of the criticism, similar to the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Why we still give any credit to Sony Universe?",
    "reviewBody": "This film might have been considered interesting sometime in the beginning of this century, but now it's nothing more than a basic superhero plot with no intrigue whatsoever.So what we are dealing with?1) Main charachter's goals and motivationDr. Morbius is a genius of his generation, whose goal (at least on paper) is to cure himself and his friend from a disease that involves constant supply of blood. He finds a cure, but it comes with some drawbacks. Basically the doctor will now have to kill to stay alive. I believe this was a basic promise for this movie. However when we first see Jared Leto I can't help but think, that he was an awful idea for this role. His character doesn't show any regard for human life and if he has to deal with life-or-death situation he seems to save lives out of necessity and not because of his moral principles. That's why when he finally has to kill (at the end of the second act) I don't get any emotional feedback for his deed. Usually this kind of action shows us how far has the main hero fallen and why they should be considered an antihero, e.g. Remember how unconcerned Lou was when Rick was killed (Nightcrawler).2) Interaction between characters.In the second scene of the movie two of our main characters meet each other and the \"eternal\" friendship begins. The only act of care for each other happens exactly in this scene, when Morbius saves Loxias's life due to morbius's unprecedented genius. After that we don't get nearly any scene that shows Matt Smith and Jared Leto being friends. Why you ask? Because movie doesn't have time for this. A few moments later Matt Smith's character already becomes the bad guy and well is now to be stopped.Basically the same transpires between Morbius and other side characters. There's no chemistry between any of them.3) And finally the awful third act consisting of a lot of CGI mess and some questionable decisions by the main antihero. This finale is so basic so I can't even be bothered to describe it, you have seen it some many times already, so you know what's going to happen before it all even begins.Epilogue: a few years ago this movie might have been considered \"quite good\", but for 2022 it's an awful movie that thankfully will fail at the box office.4/10\nJared Leto won't be appearing in any cinematic universe soon 🤷‍♂️P. S. I think the only way to pull you to the cinemas to watch the movie may be Michael Keaton's appearance. However it happens only in the after-credit scenes and remains ambiguous.",

    "reviewTitle": "A profoundly bad movie. Sony is 100% guilty of false advertising. Early review.",
    "reviewBody": "This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.",

    "reviewTitle": "Overdone CGI and editing aside- I enjoyed this one",
    "reviewBody": "Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10.",

    "reviewBody": "Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

But it's still not that bad how some people make it seem it is.Definitely worth watching and seeing it for yourself before being scared off by reviews that are not even slightly accurate.Just my opinion :)",

The long takes of certain single scenes were so exhilarating!! It even did some horror scenes really well!!And the acting by Jared and Leto and Matt Smith was Soo good!!I really enjoyed it!And the post credit scene got me SOO excited as well but which ended up being kind of underwhelming though..",

It was a crazy letdown with a messy script, bad writing, uninteresting characters, VFX that varies between really good and just awful, a terrible final battle and a really abrupt ending.

    "reviewBody": "UNDERRATED. AS. HELL. Morbius does not deserve the hate at all. People in the Internet read the first reviews of critics and started spreading what they were saying, so suddenly everyone was saying how bad this film was without having even watched it. Now they have watched it and nothing's gonna change their minds. It's a snowball of hate that grows and grows and it's completely uncalled for.Jared Leto is getting the same amount of hate he got when he portrayed The Joker; sure, it was a very \"out there\" portrayal, but still unique and original. I believe the same thing happened back then. Which I don't understand, because the guy is a tremendous actor (and a great freaking singer too, but that's besides the point). Maybe people have something against him? Maybe he did something bad that I don't know about and got \"canceled\"? In any case, the fact stands: he's a really good actor.Watch Morbius without reading too many reviews and make up YOUR mind. That's the only way to actually see this movie for what it is - a dark adventure that does its best to serve as a connection between universes, but also a great origin story for one of the most underrated Spider-Man villains ever.",

Great action, non stop humour, really great story telling, and excellent acting. I really loved it, this beats everything marvel have put out prior! What are the bad reviews from critics even talking about? I am almost emotional writing this due to how absolutely breathtakingly awesome it is! It's like the perfect pizza, with all the toppings and you could eat and eat that pizza and every bite is an orgasm for the pallet. I will think about this film for the rest of my life, and will watch it again and again. Move over batman, move over every other film that we all thought was the greatest film ever, all the films throughout the years that you think aew excellent, and classics, forget it mate! This is what cinema is, this is what an amazing flawless remarkable piece of art looks like! Yes! Go see this absolute outstanding, totally insane fun rollarcoaster ride of delight!! If there's one thing we live behind that years and years later someone goes \"we did something right!\" it'll be this gem.",

It was pretty forgettable over all, especially the action sequences, which isn't a good sign for an action movie, and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few characters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships, and then it just kinda ended without me being ready for it.That said I was never really bored in the theatre. It was an interesting enough premise, I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout. None of these actors are gonna win any Oscars for their work on this movie, but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance. Over all an OK night at the theatre and I would rather re-watch this than anything Disney/Marvel had put out post Far from home, except No Way Home, and even that isn't super good IMO, it's just special to watch because of all the returning actors. Try to pitch that movie but have every returning character from the other universes be played by different people you'd end up with something properly stupid.",

I think people are so use to the Jokes after jokes after jokes these new marvel/Disney movies they have been producing where every marvel character is funny. So when you see a darker toned movie from them that's not family friendly people don't like it. I think the pacing was good I was tuned in. Its also the fact He's not a big name like Spiderman/Thor. However for a standalone movie it wasn't bad, but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos of others like blade etc. Or they should of had him introduced into someone else's movie first like how Black Panther was introduced in the avengers movies. I think you should see it for yourself everybody has their own taste. I like the darker side of Marvel like Blade, Spawn, Ghost Rider, Punisher etc.",

This film doesn't seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding amazing film, it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that it's building up to something bigger. My opinion would be ignore the critics, go watch the film yourself, watch the to mid-credit scenes and make up your own mind.",

Eye rolling even.It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it was super underwhelming and lazily crammed together.I couldn't say I'd ever tell someone they need to go see this, out of fear they'd want to strangle me. LolIf I didn't have an affinity for the character from reading comics my whole life, I think i would have absolutely hated it but that love got me through it.I wish I had better things to say, but it's a pretty mediocre film that deserved to be better. Leto deserves it to be better as well.The end credits stuff is more entertaining than the actual film. At least they left me with something.Kinda bummed.",

    "reviewTitle": "Decent film with lots to be desired",
    "reviewBody": "Average film at best, the opening 30 mins were actually pretty good but it then just steadily declines in the final two acts. The chemistry between Leto and Smith was nice to see but I just wish their characters were more fleshed out as there is so much lacking in their development. The cinematography was really nice and the overall plot was predictable but not the worst I've seen on the other hand the cgi in this film is awful and completely stopped me from being able to fully submerge in the story. This film had some strong potential for a newcomer in the Sony cinematic franchise but just ultimate falls short. The other main issue is the writing; most characters just make stupid decisions such as the detectives and it's hard to watch whilst trying to suspend disbelief. It doesn't deserve the current rating of 4.6 as believe me I've seen much worse films but it just doesn't hold up compared to the other films in Sony's world.",

Movie felt rushed with underwhelming fight scenes. Movie's theme is supposed to be dark, maybe you shouldn't make a dark themed movie with a PG rating, you know? Otherwise, something like this is likely to be the result. It's like making a PG rated slasher movie. Batman did a better job at being dark despite the PG 13 rating.

    "reviewBody": "From when this movie was first announced I was hesitant as Jared Leto has been an actor who has been rather hit or miss in the last few years, Sony as a studio has been notoriously bad with solo superhero movies in recent times and this movie has been pushed back more times than I can even remember. But I still walked in with an optimistic mindset.Wow was I proven right to be hesitant. This must be one of the worst superhero movies put to screen and one of the worst cinematic experiences I've sat through in a very long time.This movie from the first 10 minutes immediately felt off, scenes jumped from moment to moment without much context in-between. Each scene felt separate from one another and the lacked much connection or through line. Which doesn't help this already thin excuse of a plot as Morbius checks all the typical boxes as it tells a story about the generic science experiment gone wrong, to a man who deals with (insert medical condition), who must learn to control his powers and fight a villain with the same powers.The acting from all the cast felt bored and sloppy, the only actor who was putting in any work was Matt Smith who saved as many scenes as he could as he looked as if he was having the most fun during this film.The CGI was laughably bad, looking like an early 2000's movies and the third act left me looking at the screen and audibly ask \"Is that it?\"Don't waste your money on this movie, wait till it inevitably ends up on one of the numerous streaming services available and instead go and see The Batman again.",

    "reviewBody": "I had high hopes for this movie. For what it is, it is good. If you are a comic book fan, then you are going to be disappointed. I am ranking this at a 7 because if you are new to this character and just watching it with no bais then you are going to like this movie.For action, there is a ton of it. It would have been greatly enhanced if it had been done in 3D. No sex scenes, and mild cussing, allows for children of most ages to see it. However, with the onscreen CGI transformations it may cause nightmares.This aside. The story line follows a fast paced \"jump in\" style of story telling. You feel lost in the first few scenes of the movie and then gain footing about 20 minutes in. The best scenes sadly are what is shown in the trailers. That being said. There is a romantic side to this story, as many movies have. It is a man with a rare blood condition, who is above averagely smart who happens upon a formula crossing the DNA of a Vampire Bat with that of a Human, causing a hybrid al a Bruce Banner/Hulk. Dr. Michael Mobius is able to take on supernatural/superhuman abilities such as flight, sonar, and strength, as long as he feeds on a blood substitute that is slowly losing its ability for him to survive without drinking human blood.His one and only friend, a boy named Lucian \"Milo\" who happens to have the same type of blood issue as Morbius is his benefactor and pays for the controversial and state of the art treatments that leads to their mutual transformation into Vampire hybrids. And as any story arch goes, you have one who is good, and one who turns bad with the new found power. It then turns into a superhuman fight throughout new york with Morbius's love intrest getting caught up in the middle.",

I bet you Leto improvised that .Spoilers ahead\nNow as a movie far away comes cinema, standard this movie is a nightmare. Cgi at times looked good but all the other times it looked bad . Plus who wrote this ?Character doesn't have grief,pain, sorrow, A doctor killing innocents after innocents (?) , Goons are in the protection of a ship (?) , Dr Michael works with one assistant, just one(?) , Horrifically done younger story, unnecessary (?) , Someone edited dark knights score in to this (?) , There's no police wide manhunt for him (?) , Only Two fbi officers are in charge (?) ,\nI could go on but at this point i don't think it deserves more writing & i am writing this review only seeing half of it . Some people supporting this are trying to be rebels because of its actors , seriousness & edgy horror ; its understandable but know this , these three doesn't change the fact its a badly gutted long movie forced to cramp in 1 hr 45 mins of time .\" Probably this is how covid spread ; A lackluster job \"Stop letting studio executives edit movies .

The story seemed out of place with too many holes. Could have made better choices in several areas of the movie.The biggest was probably the too earlier of a reveal of what Morbius was underneath. They should have done it classic. Show him struggle after the serum but come out of it like the experiment was a success. Having him discover his powers along the way and possibly might want to use them for good until the artificial blood didnt work and the beast inside started to take over. Having Matt Smith all of a sudden know where the serum was in the lab when he was only in there a short amount of time and didnt really understand what was going on.That was the biggest problem. Too rushed and missed opportunities with character development and story. The SFX in the movie werent great, they should have come up with better way of showing his powers that must make it a trailing blur. Needed to stretch it out and make better decisions, could have been a good one.Gave it a 5 because I have seen worse. They can maybe reinvent the character when the Blade movie comes around.",

Both Lucien and Morbius take the serum to save their lives. Morbius prevents Lucien to get the serum as he warns him. Morbius was asleep when Lucien took the serum inside Horizon Labs. Morbius fights Lucien and Martine played by Adria Arjona is the assistant was kill by Lucien and Morbius revives her turning her into a vampire. Adrian Toomes appears in mid credit scene for the reshoots that is transported to Sony-Marvelverse recruiting Michael Morbius to fight Spider-Man. But Tom Holland Spider-Man is not in this universe.

It seems not necessary! Overall I think this is a nice movie and I don't think I wasted my time to watch it.",

    "reviewBody": "I have seen the overly-delayed: Morbius, and this isn't a huge dumpster fire like the reviews have been calling it, but man, it's bad. It's not a good movie by any means, but it does have some cool fight scenes and horror aspects that boost it from a 4 to a 5. Matt Smith's villain is really interesting and his performance was probably the best part of the entire movie. But the story was so out of place, and some of the scenes felt so rushed and the CGI could use some work here and there. And obviously the worst part was cutting out the Spider-Man references and putting Adrian Toomes's scenes all in the Post-Credits. I stayed for the Post Credits Scenes, and they were just stupid. Overall, I would wait to rent Morbius at home, or wait until it's on streaming, because overall, it's not good.",

There was the filler plot of the antagonist and the pacing of the movie that set my. At the same time there were mentions of the boat scene that were involved in the origin comics that pleased me a bit.As for the visuals I enjoyed them. From the slow motion to the sonar ability. Few scenes stood out from the occasional wonky edited background. (Pretty normal for action-based film). Like I said before I was satisfied with the visual effects.All in all it was a pretty average film for Sony. I would definitely watch it again and maybe check out the comics for Morbius. 😉",

The problem is that morbius has no connection or conflict with spider-man. The comics had morbius use spider-mans blood to become a monster, they stripped that away. This was clearly an experiment in disjointed spider-man side characters without using spider-man. It also fell hard into the dark and grungy trope of modern movies trying to be batman.This got a 2 and not a 1 for two reasons: it did mostly adhere to the morbius character arc, and atleast its not Eternals.",

    "reviewTitle": "When I tell you this was the worst film I've seen, I mean it...",
    "reviewBody": "I'll give credit where it's due, the cat was flawless. SPOILERS: Did it need a voiceover for 5 min explaining things we had just seen? No. Did we need scenes that led to nothing (ex. Taking the lab from the men and then literally 5 min later being back at his OG lab, Matt Smith dancing for 3 min attempting to make being a vampire cool or sexy)? NO. We saw no real turmoil from any of the characters when they realize they have to MURDER TO SURVIVE. And we saw no learning to gain control of powers from Morbius's character, it quite literally went one second from Morbius killing people on accident because he needs blood, to him getting vicious at the sight of a TINY cut, then to him being completely fine with blood when with his dying sliced open mentor, all in a span of 10 min. Continuing with that point he didn't need any trial and error when it came to anything he did. One second he had never flown, to the next second he just felt the airwaves and was off. The plot was so fast pace I genuinely felt like Fantastic Four (2016) was paced better and that film was catastrophic. There was no cohesiveness when it came to any of the scenes (ex. Bancroft being in her apartment being watched by Milo, to the next scene she is out on the street somehow aware the police are following her). The ending was extremely flat with no real battle which I expect when going into any film characterized as \"action/adventure\". Also Slo-mo fights DON'T MAKE FILMS INTERESTING, it wasted the time needed to develop the plot. Next time use those extra thirty seconds and budget into making a better storyline. I also can't tell how the end credit scene makes any sense as to how does Toomes somehow get transported to the wrong universe (thanks to No Way Home) and how does he get his suit, which I had assumed wouldn't have been transported with him. I believe the changes from the trailer and what was shown may have been done due to reshoots but at least make the reshoots more visually interesting and exciting than the trailer shots. I'm not a huge vampire fan, with that being said I am a huge Marvel fan, and this film had me in pieces the whole time. Scenes that were meant to be serious ended up being hilarious because they were so pointless. I understand origin stories have a lot to pack in a short time frame, but they have been done well as shown by Venom and the majority of the other Marvel films which had much more intricate and appealing plots.",

It was great!To me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the charisma, he was proficient in this role but nothing more than that!I really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared, moved, flew, glided and transformed the rest was unremarkable.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10, it was well worth a watch even if in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story.",

Matt Smith is undoubtedly the standout, completely over the top and clearly enjoying it.The CG is extremely messy and distracting, especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible. The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact, made worse by a lack of blood and over relicance on slow motion.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's okay, and you'll be okay.",
    "reviewBody": "FIRST OFF: I scrolled down through some of these reviews, I understand, and agree with some of the criticisms I see about this film, others.. well I can just see you really want Spidey & Company back at Marvel & I do believe it does help cloud the judgement just a bit & I get it, now am I saying this movie is perfect? NO. Is it good? Well, no. But it's okay. To go to the extreme that this movie is the second coming of Fantastic Four (2015) is an extreme to me, and If you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but I will just advise you to go rewatch it again.Morbius is a cool little movie, that I see as a bigger risk than any of the previous spider-man related projects it has dropped, while I, being a comic reader for most of my life wasn't jumping for joy when it was announced, I threw my respect for trying it at least. The product was what I pretty much expected; the films' story does what it can with what very little it has to work with, it's not groundbreaking, but I will say I was able to look through it's basic dialogue, and story errors to see great performances from both leads (Leto, Smith) The CGI, I believe was worth my price of admission, and I RARELY mention that as a positive on any review, I was pretty impressed and had no reason to be. The action scenes are really cool, have some fascinating shots, and feel somehow immersive, leaving me with this feeling like I almost was there seeing him experience some of the beauty in some powers. There are a few moments that story wise you will scratch your head or ask yourself if you missed something & I believe I fault that on the runtime and I also question what may have been left on the cutting room floor as I had noticed a couple of scenes from the trailer missing from this movie, which I really hope didn't happen but I understand this is a typical studio decision, even though 2 hours is average for a blockbuster. An additional, and final criticism I do share with some is that this absolutely should've been rated R, no question about it, and it probably would've hit better, but then again the budget cut would've probably gave us worse looking CGI.At the end of the day, check it out if you're thinking about it, if you're on the fence, just don't.The real lesson is... Film Studios.",

    "reviewTitle": "Morbius Needs A Doctor For Storytelling",
    "reviewBody": "The Make Up/Effects at Points:\nWhen they are investing and putting effort into the movie, the effects are not bad in Morbius. While not really achieving what Disney has perfected, there are times where the pale, emaciated figure of Morbius is rather shocking to see and I applaud the ability to make his disease look realistic. Once the vampiric powers start to arise, there are times where the effects are looking pretty cool, and hold some edge of cool for me in the way they designed the transformation features. Seeing his eyes transform into this blind like state was my particular fate, but other eye color changes, the warping of the face at times, and even the cool finger effects of his claws were elements I thought were done well for this film. It's again not the most unique or jaw dropping experience we've ever seen, but it works for me.The Special Effects:\nAgain, there is a lot of room for improvement, but at times Morbius manages to shake some things up for using technology to make some moments pretty cool. At the lower level of likes is the dash like speed force he has, managing to be actually fast, but not too slow-motion madness like Snyder likes. As more powers arise, there are some cool moments that help make you feel like you are in for the ride (like a virtual coaster), and the sonar is pretty cool in those opening moments. My favorite involves the use of critters, and the nice use of lighting and sound effects to really give you that element of dread, darkness and superhero abilities that we love to hear/see in the theater.The First Part of the Story:\nThere is a nice opening to this movie as the first act unfolds for Morbius' place in this crazy mixed up universe. A nice touching moment between the two main characters, some engaging medical drama moments that match other searches for the cure, and some other set ups got points for engagement for me in this film. If only that quality could have been kept for much of the film, but that opening showed great promise for this series.The First Action Scene:\nIt's not the most put together scene, but I did like the angle they took with the first fight on the boat. Morbius' dive into his powers leads to a predator like moment that held some dynamic angles and approaches to taking on the extras. A few first-person moments, mixed with fleeting glimpses of him in the shadows felt like a hardcore Batman Begins scene that works with this savage nature of Morbius' tale. It showed promise for the rest of the film, but that did not quite pan out.The Acting:\nIt's not the best by far, but there were moments where the actors were able to salvage some of the movie with performances that could have been capitalized on. Ariona is stunning on many levels, a combination of beauty, smarts, and spirit that makes for a more interesting supporting character for this film. She held a lot of the logic and goodness of the city, but always had the ability to challenge the rules that made her perfect to help with Morbius' plans. I'm going to skip over the other top billed actor due to their low involvement, but Matt Smith as Milo had moments that would have worked had they reigned some of the writing back. Smith's non intense moments do have some heart to it, and that first act again shows the promise of a complicated character. When he is forced to go to other extremes, there are times his mannerisms are perfect for the role, and other times a little too much. Still, I enjoyed the performance he brought to some degree. Leto is of course the star of the film, and he tried to do as much as he could with what he was given. Leto's first act is strong, and his second act is not bad, but there is just some missing direction or planning that gets lost to the weaknesses of the movie. Overall, there is some decent and good chemistry, but it's lost to a lot of other things in this movie.DISLIKES:The Weaker Acting Moments:\nI never expect Oscar roles in these movies, but I've had enough quality to know stronger acting roles in a superhero movie. Morbius has a lot of shorthanded acting moments, many being cheesy, flat, or just ludicrous with the material given. As the movie progressed, the acting quality continued to worsen until it was just a messy finish that was humorous at times and lacking on others.The Writing:\nI don't know what's up with the dialogue, but the movie's quality in lines also degrades over time. That strong start, engaging dialogue with realism and panache are practically absent at the end, and things just become very simplified and cut to be almost not needed by the end of the film. Other lines and attempts to be clever find their marks, but most are straight misses for this reviewer, lost to all the over-the-top visuals and lackluster second and third acts that have too much in them.The Comedy:\nIs very limited for me to be honest. The movie's jokes have become stale from the multiple trailers that they have very little bite to them unless you have missed those trailers. Other jokes are very forced on you, and for me (and most of my audience members) did not generate too many intentional laughs. I hate to say that, but I just did not laugh as much as I have at other superhero movies in this film.The Action:\nSony used to be awesome with their superhero action, giving me those high-flying Spiderman moments that to this day still get me stoked for what they did. However, Morbius' darker atmosphere offered some chances to tear into the fighting again as he explored the nature of his powers. While some of these effects did accomplish this, much of the action was lame for me, quick bouts of overexaggerated moves that were over before they started. No coordination, no titanic displays of powers, just a few quick blurs into slow motion snarls don't make for the most entertaining battles for me. Throw some choreography, a bit of fun moves, and some other tropes and this could have worked. And as a plus, drop the Snydervision antics down a peg if possible.The Visual Effects: The Other side:\nSome things look awesome and others are showing the limitations of Sony's group and the impact on budgets. I can't say it's the worst, because they can still do better than me, but the cheesy visuals dilute the vampiric mode they were striving to design. During the creature moments, prosthetics could have helped with this, while also tightening up the CGI to not look so fake and artificial. It's nothing that destroys the movie for the most part, but Disney again has proven their merit in this element.The Story:\nThis is the weakest element of the movie for me, and the part that I think weakness many of the other elements mentioned above. Morbius' first act actually is not bad, a little predictable, a few extra cut moments, but sets the stage for ethical dilemmas that will be tested in the coming hour and a half. And then comes the second act where suddenly things pick up pace, lots of elements are pushed in, action scenes get muddy, and build up/testing is rather low, dropping all that preparation. The movie tries to fight quality and speed at this point, and the thing that suffers is suspense and character utilization, which is very poor in this movie. Big name actors, and roles get various levels of showing up on screen, most of which feel very weak to the promise being made. Once the third act hits... the movie is rushing to not only wrap up this chapter with an \"exciting\" climax, but also set up for the next movie if they get greenlit. Unfortunately, this failed miserably for me and felt like a sweep under the rug. Unlike Venom, the after credits scene could not redeem the ending, and even these scenes don't quite make sense or have the punch I think was envisioned. Had the story been balanced and not as much crammed in, perhaps all these dislikes would be likes.The VERDICT:\nMorbius is indeed one of the weaker installments of the Marvel series, and it all comes down to planning, writing and balance, which this movie lacks. Sure, there are moments that do work for me, the first act in particular being the strongest part, alongside some effects and fighting do work for me. The acting does its best with the material, but it can only do so much with what it was given, which is not much at times. Where the movie fails though is that the visual effects are lacking at times, alongside mundane action sequences that utilize little of the imagination Sony once held for their hero flicks. It's really the writing and story though that just have everything collapse, a rush mess that seemed to take hits with each delay, including the hasty wrap up and teasers that they are trying to lure you back in with for the sequel that may come. It's too much in one movie and it really pales in comparison to a lot of other things in this category. Thus, the effects may be the only worthy theater visit quality, while I give a strong nod to seeing this at home if you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Horror: 5.5\nMovie Overall: 4.0-4.5.",

    "reviewBody": "This is not a bad movie. The reviews so far must be DC trolls or from EU bureaucrats. But neither is this a very good movie, mainly because it feels short, or incomplete. I saw someone complain over studio interference, and if so that make sense and would explain the short run time and what feels like cut-off scenes.I have 3 major complaints about this movie.The first being what I already mention that the movie feels too short. I got the same feeling as when I was the original JL movie, you can tell that it was unnecessarily and weirdly cut down. Here it feels like the studio cut out 20 min or so. The second complaint I have is that the filming is too dark. I get it is bats, superheroes and things that hide in the dark, but you do not need to make everything muddy and unclear. The third objection I have is that this is very standard. They took no risks whatsoever. What you think this movie is, that is exactly what it is. This is almost as generic as BlackPanter was, and this movie follow almost the exact same pattern as that movie so without saying anything more you now know 95% of the plot of the movie just by reading this sentence. They could have taking this bloodier R-rating, or at least taken a few turns that is different to all other similar movies.With those things out of the way this is still decently entertaining. We got a bit spoiled with great superhero movies the past couple of decades so this is nothing special, but if this had been out in the 1990s it would likely been celebrated as one of the best superhero movies of all time. Morbius is definitely worth a watch and worth the movie ticket. You will not be bored, the acting is great, music and costumes spot on, CGi is mostly great (a few misses) and the movie has good dialogue and a good ending. I am not sure why people complain.I give this a 6/10, but I will upgrade to a 7/10 to offset all the negative reviews.",

Entertaining, fast pace, lots of action, very nice effects, good connections to the spider verse and Sony's monster verse.Sony is building their own franchise of monsters with venom, morbius abd the likes. It will pay dividends in the end. Some would even suggest they make better movies than the Disney marvel.Don't believe the critics. This one is a must for the fans.",

    "reviewTitle": "Even with Low Expectations, this Marvel Movie Disappoints",
    "reviewBody": "I have been a fan of Marvel films since I was a kid and I always try to look for the good in them first, simply because I don't enjoy disliking them. When a superhero story is told very well, they're some of my favourite stories out there. When Sony began to branch out their Spider-Man universe and make villain films, I was very worried. I had some fun with both Venom films, but neither were great by any means. Well, the latest Sony/Marvel villain film, Morbius, has just hit the big screen, and it's not good, which is saying a lot coming from me.Trying to cure himself of a rare condition, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) discovers that there may be a cure hidden in the blood of bats. After injecting himself to find out, he morphs himself into some kind of vampire. From here, he begins to lose control, creating casualties along the way. His best friend Milo (Matt Smith) also has this condition, so I'm sure you can guess where the villain storyline comes into play here. So now that you have the just of the premise, let's dive in.Firstly, I'm not going to ignore the elements that worked for me overall. I'll admit that this is the best I've seen from Jared Leto in a while and the chemistry he shared with Martine (Adria Arjona) was absolutely a highlight of the film. The tone suits what's going on and I enjoyed the look of it overall, but the tone and slow pacing eventually grind the film to a halt on a few occasions. I'm also all for a darker hero/anti-hero story in the Marvel universe because we haven't had much of that, but there just wasn't enough of a good story being told to back that up. There was an effort here, it just didn't work for me.So, why didn't this film work? Well, I was instantly turned off by the first scene, as the discovery of the bats is literally the opening sequence. Just a couple of scenes later he's already injecting himself and the cure begins to work. It's almost like the first act of the film was condensed to five minutes. Moving along, there are many scenes of dialogue that drag on, while the important plot points seem to be brushed over as bullet points. Morbius is so focused on getting to the good stuff, but it's sacrificing its characters in the process. On top of not really caring about what was going on, the finale just felt like another CGI fight that lasts for about 20 minutes. Those sequences can be tolerable or even great if they're part of a good film, but I just found myself rolling my eyes this time.In the end, Morbius is a film that takes place in the same world as Venom (maybe?) and Spider-Man (maybe?), but I was too confused with the conclusion of the film to really know where it takes place. I'd almost say it takes place in its own world. Morbius is a movie that clearly feels tampered with in post-production, and not in a good way. I do like Jared Leto as this character so I will gladly sit through a film that includes him, but I really don't care to see a series of films based solely on Morbius. Once the credits rolled I had no desire to recommend it to anyone and I can't see myself revisiting it, unless necessary. Morbius, even with low expectations on my part, sadly disappointed me.",

I think that given a sequel it could only get better because all the basic character development would be out of the way.2.) It's a vampire movie, not a marvel movie and I feel like that threw people off. It's different.3.) It's hard to stand out when you're released so close to movies like Spider-Man, Venom 2, and Batman.

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel's Gothic Tale Of Vampire-Fame Superhero Will Drain All Your Blood",
    "reviewBody": "Morbius (2022) :\nMovie Review -Marvel means superhero. But is it completely true? Can Marvel be something different too? Yes, it can be. Can it be something related to vampires? Yes. Here's Morbius to give you all the answers. You see, this concept of failed experiments (of scientists or doctors) or side effects of experiments is way too old in Hollywood. James Whale made some iconic films like Frankenstein (1931), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935) with this formula in the horror genre. George Waggner followed Whale's footprints and made \"The Wolf Man\" (1941).Those early experiments were shocking to the audience in that era because Hollywood was establishing new genres then. But the same stuff became old and cliched with films like \"Hallow Man\" (2000), \"Spider Man\" (2002), \"Hulk\" (2003) and a few others. Some films used the formula of a failed experiment to show the good guys, while some used it for the bad ones. Spider Man 3 came with that Venom thing, which showed us two characters being haunted by the same supernatural power, and recently we saw a Malayalam superhero flick, \"Minnal Murali,\" (2021) with the same thought. Marvel's Morbius is quite similar to these two films. But it has a damn boring plot and a predictable twist that just doesn't survive.In the film, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease with the help of his girlfriend and fellow doctor, Martine (Adria Arjona), but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. He is blessed with enormous powers, but he doesn't know how to control them. Is it a gift or a curse? His surrogate brother, Milo (Matt Smith), shows him the other side of this new invention, which creates differences between them. Who will win in the end? A good vampire or an evil one? The second half of Morbius provides you with all the answers, and believe me, there is nothing unpredictable or new here.Marvel films are usually not dark, but this one is an exception. I don't need to explain what happens when Marvel tries something dark and intense. The fans don't expect them to make such films. They just want entertainment and larger-than-life characters with screaming heroic acts, not a story. With Morbius, Marvel fans get neither of them. Morbius is not a superhero film, actually. It just ends up being a superhero flick, somehow. A vampire drama is nothing new for us. From \"The Golem\" (1920), \"Nosferatu\" (1922), \"Dracula\" (1931), and many other well-known horror films and TV shows (in every industry across the world), the idea just doesn't change. Then how can Morbius be an exception? It just happens to be dropped in the wrong universe and at the wrong time, that's all.Jared Leto has been impressive in the last 5-6 years, with some good acting credits to his name. So, Morbius was a simple task for him because VFX did the majority of the work for him. Well, this is not just the acting-driven role he deserves, but he's fine with whatever acting-loaded scenes he has got. Matt Smith is surprising, though. His character comes as a surprise, and that's still digestible, I should say, but his performance too comes as a surprise, and that's a pleasant surprise, I must say. The gorgeous looking Adria Arjona hasn't got too many long scenes, but whenever she appears, she makes sure that you notice her presence. Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson's support is strictly okay.Morbius is full of colourful visuals. It looks unnecessary and illogical as the colour themes and that foggy smoke behind the vampires don't really make any sense, but don't know why, the screen appeal carries it through. It doesn't bore, and that's too much, but the screenplay does. Also, the fighting scenes are shot from close angles - putting a lot of strain on your eyes for some time. Nevertheless, a few of them are brilliantly shot, and indeed, they entertain you. However, a little more practical sense would have only helped.Morbius' mediocrity is not limited to the writing, but also reflects on Daniel Espinosa's outdated vision. Come on man, I mean, it's 2022, not 1982 to show so much repetitiveness on screen. Espinosa's directional techniques drain all the blood out of Morbius' body. Somehow, the soul survives due to Marvel's comic tale. Rest, it's a strictly below-average show saved by some breathtaking action sequences and somewhat pleasant visual effects. Don't expect anything more than that, not even a penny, because if you do, Morbius will suck all your blood during those 106 minutes. Overall, an underwhelming Gothic tale with uneven Marvel stamping all over. SKIP IT!RATING - 4/10*",

    "reviewTitle": "Halloween film",
    "reviewBody": "Morbius Review-\nMinor SpoilersPros:\n1. Entertaining. This film is only 1 hour and 44 minutes long and goes by pretty fast. The first half of the movie is definitely better than the rest. I was surprised it actually has some cool parts and Dr. Michael Morbius is a kind-hearted person deep down and has elements that reminded me of Eddie Brock. I definitely need an oversized pajama shirt of Morbius's scary face on it now! His character I think has potential.2. Martine Bancroft. The main female character Dr. Martine Bancroft is a colleague of Dr. Morbius and in the comics becomes his fiancé. She brings cool female touch to the horror of this movie, I ended up liking her character.In comparison to Venom's Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) Martine (Adria Arjona) is a cooler better supporting character and a lot more loyal. Okay yes and she also has a cat (which Morbius lets hang around).3. The 2 mid credit scenes. The theater that I was in, like smart Marvel fans, stayed around for the credits and it was the moment that people cheered. I won't go into details with what they were but it was awesome! It definitely is part of the other Marvel universes.Cons:\n1. The villain. Matt Smith who is supposedly a good actor in other films SUCKED in this (no pun intended). In my personal opinion he is what dragged this movie down. Jared Leto is apparently a better actor than Matt Smith, at least in this film. His character Milo has a scene that is about as cringeworthy as Venom dancing in the club in Let there be Carnage.2. A lot of CGI. There are a lot of scenes of CGI and fight scenes that kind of make the movie lame because of the floating weird aura around them as they move. When Dr. Morbius goes full vampire, as he looks in the photo, he looks super creepy and awesome but most of the time him and his villain don't look that cool, and of course very fake.3. Some things didn't add up. I was a little bit confused as to how his origin begins. There is a scene where Dr. Michael is standing in front of the bat cave with his bloody hand out, but then another seen where he's injecting himself with the \"cure\". It took me a minute to realize which one happened first and then later. Also there's another scene which I didn't like regarding him and Martine (I won't go into details for spoilers) but I understood it later. There were some scenes that definitely needed help.If you love dark perfect-for-Halloween type films you will enjoy this. It has its moments where it's like Venom, but not as cool or endearing. If you pass on it I understand, it's not Marvel's best, but for the Marvel boys, go judge it for yourself.For the record, Jared Leto is not in any way like the Joker at all in this movie. It lacks a lot but for a Halloween movie it's cool. 6.5/10.",

Even when they're terrible. But, those same critics give shows and films bad reviews that don't deserve it. Like halo and morbius. I for one am glad I went to the cinema to see it. Unlike endgame. 3hrs I'll never get back. In short. Don't go by dodgy critic reviews. If you like the trailer and the synopsis sounds interesting. Watch it. Make your own mind up. Don't be a sheep.

One of those in my party said they liked it better than Eternals, and I think it's markedly better than the Edward Norton Hulk, the first Thor film, the first Suicide Squad, the theatrical Justice League, and X-Men Age of Apocalypse / Dark Phoenix as well.Even marginally better than both Venom films in my opinion.That's not to say it's great, but it had enough fun moments and redeeming qualities to make it worth a watch.Apart from the first action scene which was solid, most of the rest were not particularly thrilling.Jared Leto was solid enough and Matt Smith was great.Plot was a bit thin, dialogue was proficient, and pacing was good.Special effects were good, general tone and atmosphere was well done, and the styling of Morbius' monstrous side was perfect.If the trailer held any appeal whatsoever and you go in with very measured expectations there's more to enjoy here than the current ratings would suggest.",

    "reviewBody": "A flat film with a dull plot which barely explored the idea of wrestling the beast within and did the bare minimum of explaining the characters and the plot. It's very visually stylish during the action scenes, but there's so many effects it obscures the action and the still/slow motion scenes add little to it. The characters are weak, the plot is cliché and has holes, the editing is choppy, there's an unfunny cop duo who I presume were supposed to be some sort of comic relief, and an anticlimactic ending. Add in 2 pointless post credit scenes and you have a poor movie through and through.",

    "reviewBody": "This was an excruciatingly painful film to get through. From beginning to end the film is constantly riddled with reshoots and obvious studio meddling that denies the film the ability to tell its own unique story. The story that is somewhat told feels rushed an unfinished, never fully taking the time to develop its characters, their motivations, or even the superpowers the film centers upon. It caused many inconsistencies within the plot, focusing on trying to get the point across without doing the work to achieve its goals. Every scene of the film looks chopped up and filmed oddly with camera movements that never rest for one moment to meditate on the actions taking place. The performances are non existent due to the amount of distracting visuals and pretentious story elements that are thrown at the viewers face. The film lacks any flavor or distinct personality, that makes the film feel generic, passionless, and ultimately forgettable. Along with ruining elements of unrelated, better films, this abomination of studio integrity is an experience that should not be given the attention the studio desperately needs.",

Well, my BP stayed at 90/60. It would have been even lower if I hadn't drank 2 liters of cola in my boredom. And believe me, I'm very easy to please!I'm sure lots of work went into it, and it's definitely not 1/10. However, as much as I really wanted to enjoy it, after 15 minutes, I could have told that would happen in the next 90 minutes, even with close to 0 knowledge of Marvel characters.The shirtless scene was nice - lol - I gave an extra star for that. :))The actors did their bests I guess, the CGI, and the makeups were fine for me, and there were a few great sound effects and cam angle shots as well, but the music lacked of creativity, and I really missed the action, the BLOOD, and exciting wow scenes which would have made me want to watch it again. It won't happen, unfortunately.",

Really enjoyed it.May not suit people expecting it or comparing it to other movies and having preconceived ideas. Can't we just enjoy a movie for what it is? Walk into a theatre, leave preconceptions at the door, enjoy a movie from start to finish for what it is - A little predictable once it gets going however that doesn't take away from the might of the Morbius experience and especially what it sets up post credit...

    "reviewTitle": "Not as bad as they say, worth a watch",
    "reviewBody": "Going into this movie I was expecting it to be bad, borderline unbearable, largely due to the critic reviews. Oh boy did they get it wrong. This movie is far from as bad as they say, but I also would not describe it as anything spectacular. I feel that people are comparing it to other Marvel properties such as No Way Home and that is why reviews are so bad. That is unfair to compare it to such other films as Morbius is a fresh take on Marvel it feels. It is obvious that the delays ended up holding back what this movie could have been, perhaps what it truly should have been. It was enjoyable to watch from start to end. Loved the action sequences and CGI was beautiful. Takes a little bit to get through the more monotonous beginnings, but once you get to sink your teeth into the good parts, oh boy does it deliver. Some characters needed more development and the story what is a bit disjointed. Jared Leto is finally in a role that suits him, Morbius and Leto will only get better with more appearances. I rated it a 7/10 because a 7/10 to me means that it was an enjoyable movie regardless of whatever may be wrong with it, and I would gladly watch again. It is clear it would have been better suited as a rated R film, but with its current restrictions down to PG-13 I would say it is worth a watch at least. Don't expect to be blown away, except maybe by some of the action and CGI. I can see ratings from 5/10 to 7/10 being a fair range as everyones taste are different, but some of these other reviews I see are just taking it too far because it is not what Marvel is used to pushing.",

    "reviewBody": "Morbius is wasted space. The entire movie is filler, stalling until the inevitable superpower acquisition and the showdown with the hollow villain. It's baseline superhero shlock, but even its expected plot points are underwhelming because Morbius is disinterested in itself. The characters are boring, the romance is empty, the growth is stagnant, and the final fight is disappointing. Plus, Jared Leto is a complete flatline, providing no charisma or vulnerability to relate to. In every way, Morbius is void of emotional investment, leaving its blatant commercialism to stick out like a sore thumb. Simply put, Morbius is soulless.Technically, Morbius is less incompetent but still shallow. The sound is adequate and the effects are convincing (although CGI is severely overused), but those are the only positives. The music is a cheap imitation and occasionally awkward. The production design is painfully generic, with a noticeable lack of blood. The inconsistent editing warps the pacing and jumbles action sequences. Also, the imagery is bland, dark, and cluttered, which is unpleasant and confusing. Lastly, Morbius doesn't have direction. There isn't a tone, message, or passion driving this film. It's completely stale and clearly a cash grab. Viewers beware.Writing: 2/10\nDirection: 3/10\nCinematography: 3/10\nActing: 4/10\nEditing: 3/10\nSound: 5/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 4/10\nProduction Design: 4/10\nCasting: 7/10\nEffects: 5/10Overall Score: 4.0/10.",

He's typically a supporting role in bigger movies but he killed it as the main character. I don't understand the hate around this movie. Yes it could've been at least 15 minutes longer with more action scenes, but for a Sony/Marvel movie they did a great job and was up to pare with their other movie Venom.

Otherwise, all the other actors were doing ok.I see what Sony is doing, and I wanna say this: Dear Sony, LISTEN TO MARVEL!! And stop trying to act like you got it. You don't. Marvel knows better.

    "reviewBody": "6.3/10I don't know anything about \"Morbius\", but I was expecting, more. It was entertaining, but it took a long time to be so. The story was alright and seemed to jump around in a weird order. I felt lost a few times trying to figure where in the story I was. At one hour and forty-five minutes, the timing felt way too long. I got bored and by the time the parts that seemed to give the movie substance, I was over it and couldn't wait for the film to end. I also disliked the whole villain aspect. He never seemed convincing and lacked any true hate for the character.The only reason I can justify giving this film a six is because visually the film was awesome, the sound along with the score was incredible, and the use of echolocation in the characters was interesting.Overall, I would recommend seeing this film on cheap night, or possibly even waiting for it to home release. The base of the film was good, but it failed to grasp any true traction. The length of the film would've been good if the story was actually interesting. Visually stunning and the soundtrack was actually amazing.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps you make a decision on it.Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

I appreciate stories that delve into alternative possibilities within science and Morbius did that. I enjoyed the awakening of powers within Morbius cannot wait to see the next film in this series.Jared Leto is one of the best actors in Hollywood and it shows.Most superhero archetypes play semi flawed characters in personality only but Leto delivers a character flawed in a variety ways, on the edge of a darkness that very few characters can go within this world.This movie did not disappoint.As someone who writes screenplays, I respect the work done to bring this film to life.The whole cast was great and each character shined!The effects were amazing, especially as Morbius began tapping into all his powers.This is the dark film that many of us have been waiting for and can appreciate solely on a great story.",

    "reviewTitle": "Down there with \"Green Lantern\" and \"Supergirl\" with the worst superhero films I've ever ever seen",
    "reviewBody": "Yeah it's just as bad, maybe even worse than everyone's saying. It's a film farted out by Sony as a shameless attempt at starting their own marvel universe by picking an unknown character and quickly dumping out a crappy film to capitalize on the Batman hype. I am being 100% truthful and honest with you this movie had barely any effort put into it at all, it just feels like a complete cashgrab, this is the superhero movie equivalent of a straight to VOD late career Bruce Willis movie.Okay, let's start with the positives.... uhhhh.... I guess the production design was okay? It wasn't really shot all too poorly, I think? I mean there are indeed some really flat shots and ugly sequences but it's not all bad, and that's where the list of positives end.Now let me be clear: I hate writing super negative reviews because it feels like I'm bullying the people who worked on this, movies are hard to make and all, but I have next to no sympathy for studio cashgrab movies they had the budget to make it good and took the easy way out, I do feel bad for Jared Leto and Matt Smith, I love Matt, and I want him to be in better stuff, but he's awful in this. I have a really hard time blaming Leto and Smith for their bad performances because it honestly doesn't entirely feel like their fault, rather it feels as though the writers are to blame. The script is dinosaur dung incarnate, I have no idea how someone proof read this and said \"yeah that's good,\" Morbius and Milo have 0 character whatsoever, no defining character traits, no development, no depth, not even a motive, no that's not a joke they have no motive whatsoever. Milo was crippled as a kid and he was bullied as a kid now he wants vampire powers so he can walk and kill people who aren't crippled? I say this as a question because that's what I thought his motive was until it just changed at the middle, he just becomes a bad guy who wants to kill Morbius for some unspoken reason; I assume it's because Morbius didn't give him the serum when he asked for it, but not only is this poorly conveyed to the viewer, but it's such petty drama and makes his character look like a giant child.Morbius is just a doctor guy I honestly don't know what his goal even is or who he's supposed to be, he has a love interest but the romance is soooo forced, him and his lady friend share 3 scenes together, kiss, and that's it. They have 0 reason to be together at all, and the woman who plays his lady friend was a bad actress as well. There's two detective characters who they keep cutting back to but they're completely pointless, in fact, they just forget about them by the end of the movie. The \"jokes\" in this movie were hilarious, so hilarious in fact, that whenever they said a joke, NOBODY in my theater laughed. I think I heard a guy cough once. And talk about cliche, holy crap this movie follows that marvel formula to a tee, even ending with that same goddamn giant cgi epilepsy fight, but this time it's so unbelievably lame and uninspired, and there's no reason for it to happen at all. The cgi was terrible, it might've been worse than Venom, it feels so tryhardy, like this movie really wants you to think it looks cooler than it actually does. Some really goofy stuff happens in this movie as well but it's so far and few between that it makes it so you can't even watch it in the same way as Venom. Characters will die and it makes no impact at all because they aren't fleshed out in the slightest, and don't get me started on Morbius's powers, he can like glide on wind or something, he can't do it when he needs to fly off a building but he can fly... in front of a train? What? And even though he says he has \"bat sonar\" it's just super hearing, like do the writers even know what sonar is? The ending in this movie was horrible sequel bait nonsense, it was completely unsatisfying and just stupid this whole movie is so stupid and it doesn't even know it.Do not waste your time or money viewing this piece of trash, it is boring nonsense from start to finish, it not a so bad it's good movie like venom, more of a so pathetic it's dull type of movie.",

Now...\nPros:\n*The PLOT was easy to follow straight to the point, you know exactly what Michael is doing & for what reason & why he does what he does, when things go wrong\n*Theme was just fine for me overall, though it might fall for some, in this department depends on the individual\n*Characters is both a pro & con for me, you have some who were enjoyable, some you might care less for. Michael, Martine & Emil were the ones I enjoyed more & wanted to see more of in this film\n*Attention to detail when it came to showing us his abilities was very interesting for me. The hearing, sonar, flight, speed in a manner I personally haven't seen before so that was refreshing. We already seen plenty of super strength.Cons:\n*Action \"Venom Effect\" as I call it, there are action scenes in the film lol some looked good once you got use to the speed trail effect during the lighter scenes,but some of the more darker ones \"Venom effect\" you could barely make out at times what is actually transpiring cause it's so dark.*Villain was just boring this is where the film was falling for me. Just wasn't a overall good villain. Motives you get, but overall Milo just wasn't it. Why not use BLACKOUT maybe or VIC SLAUGHTER who's just a ruthless vampire from Morbius own creation which I thought Milo was suppose sorta at 1st,but fell extremely short..since where diving into the more cosmic side now LILLITH would've been interesting character to use, but enough on that,decent start for a origin see it for yourself, only way to go from here is up.",

I can't remember most of the film, and that's also saying something. Sony and Marvel should've honestly done more justice to the film, Morbius is one of my favourite marvel characters and this film just butchered it all. I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing this film.

    "reviewBody": "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON!!I hate industrial cinema, Marvel is trying to ship a new series, with quite poor start.I found some state-of-art here:\n1- Superhero asked human being for a job/favor/task/challenge .. I can replace superhero with God & see something initiative.2- Superhero's fights based on some jealousy/envy feelings.. I can replace these with Qabil & Habil.3- Humans & Superhero both are fighting & afraid of death.I found some weaknesses: why Marvel show us how they are trying to find something that could be the bid. To let the superheros fight on. It lacks when we - as audience - notice.I found no point of redundancy of pinning the woman to stick on our heads as main character, not gone, awake!I found no point of romance scenes!! Maybe later which I never go to watch such low quality series that start with weak spark & zero build-up for the main characters or even.One last good thing: Superhero is curse. It was so good to be mentioned.One last bad thing: why superhero movies keep showing up the police as weak as we know, I think it is pointless for big segment of audience like the teenagers for example! We need to get rid of such not needed fights and show-off.",

Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.",

This is a vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid, solid characters. What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character, but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world, into another life, and accept this \"morally ambiguous\" modern-day epic. Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry.

A world where the so-called \"anti-socials\" are far more complicated than the \"normal people\" (as I´m writting this, and I use the term \"normal people\" I laugh, and feel dirty).  These anti socials are haunted by greater problems.  Self-finding issues. Tarantino uses the questions raised by one-self to make the characters of the movie think about their lives.  To think about what they´re doing with them.  As Jules says, he´s trying to be the sheperd.  Even God gets involved.  Even God has a chance.  Even bad guys can change. In more technical purposes, the director (Q. Tarantino), uses an infinity of signs, and symbols to put us throughout the story...once again, not a simple plot, but a whole world.  The camera movement, although not ground-stomping, jaw-dropping, is fine.  One thumb up.  Fine directing. The story, on the other hand...woooow!  Leaves me speechless, breathless, etc.  It´s an extasy just to read the script, just to think of it as a book.  Hats off for Tarantino as a writter...Avary too.     Finally, bashing a little bit, Tarantino needs some expertise as a director, but his writting skills are top-notch.",

The film is not like ordinary action or ordinary comedy, there is something new that Tarantino brought to cinematograph.If you don't afraid of blood, brutality, drugs, homosexualists, hitters, \"frehcn\" words etc. (and if you are old enough to watch such films) - watch Pulp Fiction. You'll find how all of these can be fun. Then watch this picture again - and maybe you'll find something you missed.",

DON'T READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR YOU HAVE NO DESIRE TO.I'm reading a lot of these messages condemning Tarantino for making a pro-drug, pro-violence movie?  Hello?  Did we see different movies?Just because a director SHOWS drugs or violence doesn't mean that they condone them.  Did anyone watch Uma Thurman's overdose scene and react by craving smack?  And about the violence...of the three leads (Travolta, Jackson, and Willis), only Travolta is committed to a life of violence, and he ends up dead in a toilet.  Willis' character is redeemed by saving the life of his arch enemy, and Jackson's \"holy\" revelation leads him to reject the violent life of a hitman.Any film that takes place in the criminal underworld has to show the viewer elements of sex, drugs, and violence or else lose all credibility.  Deeper analysis of this film, however, shows it to be one of the most morally present films of the '90's.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not \"Glorified\" by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction deserves much of the praise that it has been getting, and showed that dialogue alone could make a movie incredibly enjoyable. This movie is filled with terrific conversations between the characters that makes it such a delight to listen to. It isn't flawless though- I felt that entire sequence with Bruce Willis, was way too long, and bordering on the line of boring. But the last 30 minutes or so of the movie is perhaps the best 30 minutes of cinema anyone can ever experience. Starting from the scene in the car where Vincent's little 'accident' occurs, all the way to Jimmy's place and the last scene in the diner is absolutely riveting and most enjoyable to watch. The cast is just amazing, and although I thought Samuel L. Jackson was simply the best, I also really liked Quentin Tarantino's little role- he was wonderfully irritating as Jimmy. The people against all the drugs, violence and profanity should just stop whining- I mean, the movie isn't encouraging this type of behaviour, and besides, they are a bunch of gangsters, so what else would you expect?",

But in the name of justice, I guess I should mention that I used to be quite fond of this movie. The thing is that I watched it on television yesterday, and I realized that the whole movie is utterly superficial. There is absolutely nothing more to it than meets the eye. That makes it quite fun to watch for the first time, but after a while you get to know all the phrases and \"cool\" set-pieces, and you start looking for something more, something \"deeper\".

There's such a dark humored tone to that scene. The famous \"royale with cheese\" and \"dog got personality\" are also funny. But there are other scenes, like Willis and his girlfriend in the hotel room, where I'm screaming mercy. They are dreadfully boring scenes. And I'm still not sure what the movie was about. So all in all, Pulp Fiction is a better than average movie. But it's not a \"great\" movie like some people rave. \"Jackie Brown\", Quientin Trantino's other hit, is just as good. And if your looking for a dark humored comedy, check out \"Fargo\" which is much better",

People might of thought the swearing was heavy, but I thought it added a sort of... real tense to the movie. The acting was the best you will see in a while. The performaces by Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Vingh Rahmes, and Bruce Willis were fantastic. After seeing this movie I knew why it was nominated for Academy Awards including Best Picture. I think Mr. Tarentino introduced a new type of movie, that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. I hope he continues to write movies like this one. It was funny, scary, dramatic, and in its own way romantic. If I were a real critic and my say mattered, I would unanomously make this my favorite movie of all time.

This film centers around four different stories; two hit men accidentally shoot preteen informant in the back of their car, a boxer that refuses to throw a fight, and a doped upped hit man takes his drug dealing pimp daddy's coke head wife on a date and a hit man is `saved'. The stories are separate but come together like a bad episode of Seinfeld. Just to be cool and `avant-guard' Tarantino picked up his script and shuffled the pages together, added a thick smattering of pop culture riddled dialogue, and plagiarized every movie ever made.There is not one redeeming character or idea in this movie. Most hail it as deep, but  but that is only because they are shallow. I have questioned many of the film's devotees as to why they like it, but they can scarcely say more than `its cool' or they comment on it being glamourous-$500 cocaine baggies of heroin and $5 milkshakes. On its own terms, the movie is poorly crafted. Its much appraised non-linear story line is nothing new. Orson Wells challenged that institution 50 years ago with Citizen Kane. This doesn't enhance the story at all, except blunting Vincent Vega's (Travolta) pointless demise. He is alive when the credits roll, so he essentially avoids the repercussions of his actions. And finally,  Jules' (Jackson) misquoting scriptures and misapplication of the text was highly annoying. Besides, because he `found God', he is absent when his partner needed him the most. So by Tarantino's definition, God is as debased as the characters portrayed in this horrible movie. The only thing that is redeeming in this movie is the soundtrack. Maybe Tarantino should have been a DJ.",

    "reviewBody": "Best movie of the 90s my crotch!  How hard is it to show someone getting their brains blown out of their butts 50 times per second and write dialogue based solely on one word four letters long beginning with the letter F. That combined with repeated use of the \"n\" word?  Come on, you people should be outraged at such a racist film.  That alone should be enough.Now, I've only seen the clippings, and not the entire film from start to finish, I'll admit.  And I know that a lot of you are saying, \"Emperor, how do you know that you hate this movie if you haven't seen the whole thing?\"  Well, I've never been drawn and quartered, either.  You see, I thought clippings were supposed to make you WANT to see a movie.  And the ones I saw for this movie turned me off to it.Mr. Tarantino, you don't NEED to find new and creative ways to kill someone, or use the \"f\" word every three seconds to make a great film.  In fact, the ones that keep that stuff to a minimum are usually the ones that do the best at the box office.  No, I'm not saying that you should make everything all happy and perfect and \"Leave it to Beaver-\"esque, because things should be believable on film.  However, what is real is NOT always a depressing drag.  Why don't you just TRY this idea and see if I'm not right?Also, if you're in doubt as to what will work for a particular scene, project, etc., just check your W.W.E.D. (What Would Emperor Do?) bracelet.As far as rating goes, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best, I give this movie a -5.  Happy trails, and remember what I said, Mr. Tarantino!",

    "reviewBody": "Is this the greatest movie of all time?   Probably not, but it is a GREAT movie. I have seen a lot of comments about the film's morality, but a film should first of all entertain.What I hate about a movie is if it is too predictable you know what is going to happen after 15 minutes or I feel cheated if the plot is too convoluted purely to confuse me. Pulp Fiction does neither of these but just gives you enough changes of pace to keep you guessing how the stories are going to come together.   And how they do!  When you see Vincent and Jules at the diner for the last scene you just KNOW what's going to happen next but Tarantino keeps us dangling with some really funny dialogue about bacon when all  we're waiting for is the inevitable confrontation.This film is a collection of classic scenes and funny one-liners (the adrenalin-shot scene has to be my favourite).  To look at whether this is a moralistic film is the wrong way to look at it.  It's never going to be as uplifting as, say, The Shawshank Redemption, but it never pretends to that kind of film. But it does have depth. After you watch it more than once you start to think of the \"What If's\"Probably the most profound is the mix of Faith in God versus Faith in Superstition.  When Jules says that he felt the touch of God, was this a true warning to him and would HE have been shot instead of Vincent if he hadn't changed his ways.  Or was God trying to save Pumpkin and Honey Bunny through Jules?  Or was Vincent the one that God was trying to warn but he didn't feel the touch of God and so lost his life and possibly his soul to the Devil.  The briefcase's combination is '666' so there is definite imagery of Hell here.And Butch has Faith in Superstition with the dubious history of the lucky watch. What if he never went back for the watch?  Would he have ever escaped the hitmen looking for him?  And was it the fact that he had just put the lucky watch on that helped him get the better of Vincent?  And what seems like a really unlucky encounter when he runs down Marcellus and then gets taken hostage by the shopkeeper actually gives him probably the only chance to wipe the slate clean by saving Marcellus himself.  So if the watch really was lucky, what more luck could you ask for??A great movie and 10 out of 10 for entertainment (and not just the first time you watch it - tho that was the best for all the surprises).",

    "reviewTitle": "Overrated, but not worthless",
    "reviewBody": "Few movies made in the last five years have inspired such impassioned criticism and intense adulation as Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction. Most viewers either love it or hate it. Only a few folks, like myself, land in the middle ground in their critical view of it.Is Pulp Fiction the best film of the 90's ? Certainly not. Schindler's List, LA Confidential, GoodFellas and Saving Private Ryan should all rank far above it in 90's film retrospective lists it when the decade (as mediocre and uninspired an era of filmmaking as Hollywood has ever seen) is over. All four movies are more coherent and precise in their treatments of their individual subjects. All four pictures are more convincing and all do a better job than Pulp Fiction of balancing their remarkable style with substance.At its best Pulp Fiction is a rollicking, chaotic swirl of color, melodramatic tension and 90's pop iconography. The movie has a wonderfully sharp and stylish look--like a celluloid version of the comic books and cheap novelettes which inspired its story. The editing is brilliant in its quirkiness and unconventionality. The movie jumps from panel to panel with breathtaking intensity, much like a graphic crime novel. The fractured narrative structure of Pulp Fiction keeps the audience off balance: it's a superb touch that allows the movie's narrative twists and turns and visceral images to impact on the viewers.At the same time Pulp Fiction's strengths are also its weaknesses.Too often the movie is \"over-stylized\" and technical. It's like a brilliant film student's dream picture--too cute and \"too cool\" in its inventiveness and technical precision. Tarantino's unabashed tribute to pulp novels and movies can be both a joy and a bother to behold. At times, Tarantino's obviousness and lack of subtlety is grating. The movie's dialogue suffers most from this malaise.Those who praise Pulp Fiction's script as \"brilliant\" ought to run down to their local video store and rent Howard Hawk's The Big Sleep and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Both scripts are everything that Pulp Fiction TRIES (and fails) to be: funny, quirky, cool, subtle and substantial. Indeed, it is a sad commentary on current society that anyone could Pulp Fiction's muddled screenplay \"brilliant\" when placed against masterpieces of screenwriting like The Big Sleep.In writing Pulp Fiction's script Quentin Tarentino tried too hard. The screenplay is loaded with lame modern pop cliches and cutesy cultural references. The overly slick script nearly mars the brilliant acting efforts of Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and others. In light of all of this, the trite theme of redemption that runs through the movie comes across as false and shallow.Nonetheless, Pulp Fiction is still worthwhile viewing. For all of its flaws it succeeds in entertaining the audience. Samuel L. Jackson's performance--a sign of his great talent--alone makes it worth seeing. If viewers take the movie with a grain of salt they should enjoy it. It they want depth or profundity they should look elsewhereRating: 3 out of 5 stars, 81/100.",

    "reviewBody": "If you think \"Pulp Fiction\" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is \"cool\", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.",

    "reviewTitle": "Over the Hill?",
    "reviewBody": "When I saw Pulp Fiction 4 years ago, I have to say I was busting out laughing with everyone else in the audience. The vibrant dialogue, the intertwined storylines and unexpected plot twists took me by surprise. I took my girlfriend(now ex-girlfriend) to see Pulp Fiction a few weeks later, and she didn't laugh at any of the funny parts, and definitely took exception to the violence. Of course we got in a big fight over the whole thing in the car ride home. I couldn't believe that anyone with half a liver and a thyroid as their only major organs, could not see the brilliance that Tarrantino had crafted.I watched Pulp Fiction for again since the last time I saw it with my ex, and you know what? I really didn't like it as much. Now much can be said about this reaction. Maybe my ears and eyes began to bleed with the post-Tarrantino melee of knock off culture that ensued after Pulp Fiction. Things that were already cool for twenty years, like Dick Dale, or Kool and the Gang got incessantly beat into our heads as \"the new hip thing\". Fine, maybe I harbor a little resentment for how the mainstream will eventually water down anything that has any artistic merit. I think I even saw a butter commercial that used that \"Pulp Fiction\" font as title cards. Gimme a break.Back to the main point. Is Pulp Fiction a great movie? No. Is it good movie because it is entertaining? Yes. Is it an important movie? No. Do I think it isn't an entertaining movie because of the violence and profanity? Quite the contrary, I don't think that has anything to do with whether or not this movie is great or not. Pulp Fiction like myself, is a compost heap of pop-culture references. The Simpsons are a full of pop culture references yet considered great. Shakespeare is full of pop-culture references, but no one gives his work flak just because you have to open the OED to get half of it. I think too many people spend too much time dwelling on these obvious manifestations. I think the real reason Pulp Fiction is not great, is because it does nothing to create characters who are metaphoric in any sense. They are there to serve very one dimensional purposes on the screen. People praise Pulp Fiction for it's structural elements, but for my money Reservoir Dogs or a movie like Short Cuts did a better job of playing with narrative style. This brings me to Reservoir Dogs, which I think is a great and important movie because it did alter the narrative telling in a totally different way. Though much of the story element is ripped off from a similar chinese movie about twelves thieves with an informer and a heist gone bad(I can't remember the name of it), Tarrantino tells the story differently than any filmmaker has told before. Not only is the story non-linear, but if broken down into it's treatment of time, it looks like someone took a script chopped up into pieces, and then taped it back together randomly. Miraculously it all works. He also tells the story like a drama for the stage, with long extended dialogue sequences, but yet he manages to not get that \"why did they even bother putting on this film, because it looks exactly like a play\" look. (In the Company of Men, Oleanna) Reservoir Dogs has all the violence and profanity of Pulp Fiction, but it also has depth to it's characters.Tarrantino is a well educated filmmaker, in the sense that he knows his film history, and pays homage to great directors like Truffaut and Godard. Is Tarrantino a great director like them? No. In my mind he has made one truly great movie, and couple of good movies, and a couple of duds. Tarrantino might be totally screwed, as he might be scorned for the very style he invented, the next time he comes around the mountain. True no one does Tarrrantino better than he does himself, but do we really need or want it. Maybe that's why he's hanging out on broadway with Marisa Tomei, trying his shot at acting. Which by the way, he sucks at. But you know what, I've never have made a body of work that comes close to what he has managed to accomplish in such a short period of time.",

    "reviewBody": "I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole \"Jules redemption-speech\" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.",

    "reviewBody": "It seems that Pulp Fiction is one of the most discussed films on The IMDB and the opinions seem to be split totally 50/50 (like with almost every other Tarantino pic out there). But whether you like it or not, whether you hate it or love or whether your a big QT fan or just hate the guy, you have to admit that no film is more 100% sure on becoming a classic later on. In fact, this great rift between movie-goers about this film is one of the things that will make it a timeless classic (whether you like it or not). Personally I think this is one of the 5 best pictures ever made, both from a totally critical perspective and also from a more personal point of view since I think that Quentin is the best living director/writer in the business. So go out and rent the movie and decide for yourself, if you aren´t squeamish you´ll probably love it.",

    "reviewBody": "Everyone blames Quentin Tarantino for having too much violence in his movies. People say Pulp Fiction has the most violence.  I can't disagree more.  Pulp Fiction has very little violence and people should look at the movie as a brilliant piece of art and not as a violent movie.  Tarantino did an outstanding job at bringing a not that complex story and everyday dialogue to the screen in one of the most enjoyable films ever.  On top of the brilliant story and writing, there are the performances.  To start, Samuel L. Jackson gives the best performance I have ever seen on screen as Jules The Hitman.  His performance is memorible and some of the things he says and does is unforgettable.  Harvey Keitel is just as impressive as The Wolf.  The scene with Keitel, Jackson, Travolita and Tarantino in Jimmy's house is classic.  Pulp Fiction ranks among the best movies ever made and for good reason cause it is an absolute great movie and should be cherished for years to come and I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this movie.  The dialogue is great and the way Tarantino split a basic story into 3 different parts is amazing.  **** out of 4 stars for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction",

Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em.",

I'd put Saving Private Ryan above it, but that's the only film that I can of at the moment (admittedly, I haven't seen Schindler's List).  In fact, Private Ryan is the only movie that I can think of AT ALL that is better.  It's easily one best fims of all time.  Tarantino's dialogue is absolutely brilliant, the best written that I've heard in a movie so far.  The acting is incredible, as is the direction.  Well, you get the idea.  It's awesome. If you haven't seen it, get off of your computer and go to Blockbuster of whererver and rent it!  You won't regret it.My score: 9.5 out of 10NOTE: While it's an awesome movie, I should note that it's also filled with objectional stuff.  The F-word is used well over 200 times, as are many other profanities.  The violence is graphic and brutal.  There's also a brief, almost totally off-screen homosexual rape scene.  Yeah, it's not for kids.  But still, if you can stomach all of that stuff (as can I), you'll love Pulp Fiction.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is excellent.  Why?  Most importantly it is original.  It can be said, quite accurately, that many elements of this film have been stolen from other films.  No one can ever accuse Quentin Tarantino of not doing his homework (\"Repo Man\", or \"La Femme Nikita\" as obvious examples).  He even rips off much of his own material from \"Reservoir Dogs\".  But the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original.Many people have stated that \"Pulp Fiction\" has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned.  Frankly, I don't think imitation proves anything, AND I don't think \"Pulp Fiction\" was imitated significantly more than many other highly successful films.  However, to my mind, \"Pulp Fiction\" is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture icons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and interesting.\"Pulp Fiction\" also has a few truly original moments.  Christopher Walken's wonderfully dry delivery of the \"Your father kept this watch in his ass for years\" story is hilarious.There is only one serious flaw in this film:  Quentin Tarantino is a very poor actor.  Thank god he confined himself to a small role.  If he really feels the need to be onscreen, he should just go ahead and pull a Hitchcockian cameo in his films. Sure it's derivative, but at least his screen presence will be minimized.",

Some bemoan the excessive amount of death and violence and general \"no way, that's just not real, could never happen\" shenanigans -- they live in pretty neighborhoods, not backstreet *anywhere*.This movie is the treasure it is because of the incredible level of true grime and underbelly it shows in its treatment of the New Gangster. Fair warning! It's not a pretty sight! This movie is for the same person that enjoys the speeding bullet, car-wrecking, general riot and havoc type of film...But that's not all! We also see the return of John Travolta, and the meteoric Samuel Jackson! We hear dialogues that are not about backstory. Because they aren't! They're *real* people, having *real* conversations. And that, my fellows, is one of the fabulous things. We get to go along for a ride with pushers and boxers and law-breakers and murderous rednecks. And that's just the first time you watch it.Wow.PS: This movie also falls under the \"Inverse-Bruce\" Rule: A lot of Bruce Willis is not so good, but a little Bruce is incredible.PPS: Pulp Fiction: Where it's always 4:20 (unless it's Seven Twenty-Two in the A.M., of course...)",

True, it's a graphic film: graphic violence, graphic language, graphic drug content, and a graphic rape sequence; it ain't for the squeamish. But it also has some of the most fluid monologues cinema has ever produced. Not to mention that it did wonders for the careers of its principals: Travolta's career was in full-throttle after this one; likewise with Jackson, and Thurman. The foundation was laid with \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"True Romance\" - this is the film that established Tarantino as a director of a higher order.

I kept on wanting to yell at the characters to DO something! This is a MOVIE (you know, MOVE-ee) that doesn't move nearly enough. Okay, there are great movies like \"Key Largo\" that are more dialog-heavy than PF, but that's like comparing The Last Supper to a velvet painting.Ultimately, it seems QT was a limited run item. His equally boring \"Reservoir Dogs\" and the laughable \"Jackie Brown\" are just about it. Okay, it's not a BAD movie, just not anywhere near the level of \"Taxi Driver\" or so many other truly great films that too many PF fans seem to be unaware of. It's competently done; has no glaring technical errors. It has the \"novel\" play around with the time elements thing.Overall, it's typical Hollywood: tell everyone over and over again it's great and they'll have to believe it (well, at least for a while).

I think there were about 4 violent scenes in the movie (the opening scene, the accidental shooting, the S&M rednecks, and the confrontation between Bruce Willis and John Travolta). Although the scene with the S&M guys was pretty disgusting, it only lasts about 3 seconds, any R rated action movie that's come out in the last 10 years has more violence than Pulp Fiction did.  I really look at Pulp Fiction as a comedy, a satirical view of society.  The dialogue is consistently hilarious, and there are many darkly humorous moments in the film.  I thought that the scenes with Travolta and Jackson were the movie's strongest points, but the whole thing was good.  I still liked Reservoir Dogs better, though.",

    "reviewTitle": "An Original Hollywood",
    "reviewBody": "Usually you will not find a film like \"Pulp Fiction\" come out of the highly formulaic realm of Hollywood.  That is precisely why Pulp is so popular with audiences and critics, the time has come for a new breed of film within the industry.  There are a number of elements which makes Pulp Fiction one of the best and most important films in Hollywood.Something that is very original about Pulp Fiction is of course its structure.  It is both a narrative and non-narrative film at the same time. Tarantino takes on the roles of a novelist and a filmmakers, simultaneously. He tells three stories instead of the conventional single story and they are told through a number of perspectives.  This makes the film much more interesting than usual and it tightens the shared universe that all the characters dwell in.Tarantino's film is not meant to be a parody like many interpret it.  It is supposed to represent real-life.  The film's structure is circular; the film ends where and when it began to represent the perpetual crisis of life, the unending conflicts that exist within the reality we live in.In fact, Tarantino emphases this point by attacking the Hollywood interpretion of life and displaying a conflict and contrast within that. Tarantino stereotypes many elements of his film to that of the conventional Hollywood presentation.  He typifies the crime genre with his characters (2 washed-up hitmen, the crime boss, the crime boss's wife), their costumes (black, sullen), the violence, the death, the drugs.  We see it all but then it is all twisted out of its conventional shape.  The hitmen do not talk like usual hitmen displayed on film.  They talk of TV pilots, toe massages and filthy animals.  And even though they start out in the typical gangster situation with an assigned murder and retrieval of some goods, we then follow them for the rest of the day, instead of abandoning that story right then and there.  We see conflicts and situations arise that are very unexpected and unusual for men such as these.  Both their language and situations are atypical of their stereotype.  We see that people of this constructed, everyday world do not go through a formula of life, they experience life in a seemingly unplanned fashion, just like real-life.And when you look at Pulp Fiction nowadays, it has the very appealing retrospective ensemble cast.  What I mean by this is that now everyone in it is a big star but back in 1994, they weren't all that they are now.  John Travolta was wash-up and Pulp redeemed his career, Samuel L. Jackson was not well known, Bruce Willis had come off a bunch of box-office bombs like The Bonfire of the Vanities and Mortal Thoughts, Uma who?, Ving Rhames was a vitual unknown, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are purely creations of Quentin Tarantino, Eric Stoltz was trapped in the 80s teenage genre.  In fact, Harvey Keitel was probably the only star but his character in the film was purely a creation of Hollywood and maintained that way throughout.  This film still has a lot of appeal when you look at the cover box in a video story nowadays because it has this huge cast.Tarantino's direction is also not that larger-than-life style that you are used to in a big Hollywood film.  He lets his actors live and really indulge into their characters.   He lets action take shape and remain on screen longer than would be expected such as Jules taking a long sip from a Big Kahuna coke or Butch walking to his apartment to retrieve his gold watch.  He puts lots in the edges of the frame like the board games Operation and Life while Mia is about to get her adrenline shot.  He integrates subliminal messages into his scene which take repeat and careful viewings to extract.  Pulp has so much, both on the surface and within; much more than Hollywood is used to.When you watch Pulp Fiction, try to remove yourself from those who feel they have to love it because everyone else does.  Love it for what it really has and for what you can really see and feel.  Watch Pulp Fiction over and over, and with each viewing look for something new and you will find it.  You will usually only find a film with any similar merit as Pulp Fiction in the realm of non-narrative, avant garde cinema.  But now that style has invaded Hollywood so take advantage of its genius and enter the world of fiction (but remember that nothing is as it seems, maybe even the title).",

    "reviewTitle": "Most overpraised movie of the last 100,000 years",
    "reviewBody": "Gen-x audiences, overstuffed by the yupped-out aesthetic of the Spielberg/John Hughes eighties, were dying for a soupcon of seventies grunge--something urban and gritty, but ironic and retro, to fit the cynical, beat-out, slackitudinous mood of the late George Bush era. That's how Quentin Tarantino served his wake-up call to the world with RESERVOIR DOGS in 1991, the alarm clock that jolted American cinema's eyes open after the long coma between BLUE VELVET and it. And PULP FICTION was the one that knocked the ball out of the park--commercially speaking. To find a cultural nerve-pinching phenomenon of similar force, you'd have to go back to BONNIE AND CLYDE or EASY RIDER. But even they didn't have the seismic, global force of this movie: it may be hard to remember a few years later, but this picture, and its author, were burned onto the public consciousness and referenced 24/7 for long, long after its release.Seen in retrospect, it's clear what put the movie over--it's like a smooth, upscale theme store stocked with gen-x fetish items (heroin! faded seventies icon! jherri curls! tongue-in-cheek machismo! Kool and the Gang! Fruit Brute!) that could make the most out-of-it yahoo feel like a hipster.What's also clear is that it's a logy, stilted, stagebound piece of work that doesn't seem to take place in any lifelike universe, even a stylized one. The only rhythm the movie can claim is that of a writer impressed with his ability to make coiled, jivy dialogue. Scenes drag on and on as Tarantino keeps on stylin'. The center section of the movie--a boxer's romance with a French honeypie and his escape from a gangster he's double-crossed--is so thoroughly leaden and spontaneity-deprived you'd think it would've been enough to sink the movie alone. But somehow the combination of the star-studded cast and the \"inside\"-y, you-can-be-hip feel of the picture made it a blockbuster of the calibre usually reserved for movies about skyscrapers or planets exploding.Sadly, Tarantino, after a long, nail-biting hiatus, made his first genuinely great movie, JACKIE BROWN, which highlights all his strengths and eschews each of his flaws. All the fans who obsessed over the smallest minutiae of PULP greeted this impressive, grown-up work with a shrug and a quick retreat.",

Although some of the segments were led to the wrong direction which also make me think that the movie didn't make sense, but you WILL get it. The best part has to be,when John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get those druggo's in their appartment. Uma Thurman was great in this film very fresh and alive, well not really alive after that encounter with the \"needle\". The film was very bloody and had a lot of swearing, but you didn't really focus on that when watching the film - it was that exciting. Well overall here are my ratings...Acting- 4 / 5 Actors- 4 / 5 Script- 3 / 5 Display-4 / 5 Plot-   4 / 5 Performance - 3.5 / 5 Overall - 4 / 5B+",

    "reviewBody": "When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I said to my self, \"This is the most stupid movie I had ever seen.\" But then after watching it four or five times, it was actually pretty good. I bought it because it was said to be one of the best films ever made, and it had great actors in it like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken. But when I watched it was very disappointed. I thought it was really stupid, and there was no plot to it. But then I watched it a couple more times, and I could see why a lot of people liked it. The main plot to it is the story of two hit-men (Travolta and Jackson). In the movie there are four different stories about these hit-men and there amazing adventures. This movie won the an Academy Award for The Best Oringinal Screenplay. So if you want to see a fairly entertaining movie watch Pulp Fiction. If you would like to see a better film by Quentin Tarantino (Director of Pulp Fiction), see Jackie Brown. I would say it is much more entertaining.",

    "reviewBody": "Original doesn`t even begin to describe \"Pulp Fiction.\" How about \"ground-breaking\" or \"extremely innovative\". Being probably one of the most distinctive films of the 1990`s, \"Pulp Fiction\" is an offbeat, gritty, but hysterically funny film about two hitmen, their boss, his crack-addicted wife, a boxer and a few eccentric but fascinating characters and and their bizarre stories. There are about 4 or 5 stories in this film (I can`t remember, I saw this a year ago), that all overlap each other, and they`re not in chronological order either. It sometimes can be confusing, but I`m sure you`ll be able to understand it. The script for this film is sheer genius, as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, the two hitmen, argue about everything from Big Macs to shooting someone in the back of their car. Uma Thurman is radiant as the unconventional, junkie who likes to dance and crack silly jokes. \"Pulp Fiction\" doesn`t really have a plot, it sort of like a collection of a few stories, that don`t really go anywhere. There a few bloody moments, but you`ll be laughing hysterically, it`s THAT MUCH of a black comedy. The film`s low budget is very visible, but that just creates an even more raw atmosphere. \"Pulp Fiction\" is not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy an outrageously funny, startlingly original and dark film, this is for you.",

    "reviewBody": "If this film isn't making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private, candid conversation, then it's knocking you on your butt, flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic. Unless of course, you're my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching. I remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking I'd just seen something amazing and that I'd never seen anything like it before.I still remember the riveting, tense feeling I had when Butch, played by Bruce Willis decides to go back for his father's gold watch at his apartment, certain that gangsters like John Travolta's Vincent Vega are looking for him. The long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense, as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death. And then the moment he thinks everything is fine, he decides to toast a pop tart. I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. And later still, when you think everything is fine again, you're floored by another predicament.The only time this sort of experience works in my opinion, is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater. Naturally, the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension, unless of course you suffer from amnesia and don't remember what happens. But what I'm getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video.For me, Pulp Fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environment.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies of the decade and a testament to the genius of Quentin Tarantino. Building on the success of his debut, Resevoir Dogs, Tarantino delivers a superbly-scripted, masterfully-directed, crime epic. Three stories (created by Tarantino and Roger Avery) are intertwined through the film and it unfolds, much like Reservoir Dogs, out of chronological order. The film was criticised by many as being too violent, although by modern standards I think it is rather tame. The violent scenes are directed and acted so well, however, that they stick in the viewer's mind long after watching the movie. I am convinced that there is a spiritual level to the movie and the theme of redemption is a very strong one; the film finishes with Jules's decision to leave the violent lifestyle, although this decision is not chronologically at the end of the story. And the mysterious bright glow from Marcellus's briefcase will certainly leave you wondering about unearthly elements in the film. A strong cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis, certifies this film as a true classic.",

I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power. How much they love the fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy. John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a \"low-rent\" hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right! How come they never did that before: they probably did, I just missed it.). Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood. We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys. The pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however. A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a cliché. The art part comes from doing spins on the cliché, in putting a new twist on the old bull****, on the old standards. Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman. He's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers. Poor Hollywood. They've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence. If your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight. Cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the \"pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues. Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.To make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three  episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied 'coolness' in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption.",

The whole endless date scene between Travolta and Thurman? The stupid dance contest? Couldn't wait for it to end. And the ending of the date was just as useless.Then the whole long dragged-out sequence with Bruce Willis...I just kept thinking, who cares? Then the senseless rape sequence. It gets worse!Then the whole *hour* it seems we spend in that diner at the end. I don't know, it just didn't do it for me. The accidental shooting bit was ok at first, but then it too got dragged out and boring. Quentin Tarrantino should never again appear in one of his movies. He, quite succinctly, sucks as an actor (and he ain't much of a director, IMHO. He's the one responsible for keeping the movie moving (heh!) and it dra-a-a-a-ags...)To sum up, this is almost three hours of mostly boring crapola punctuated by a few shootings/interesting events and even fewer really funny moments. On the upside, Samuel Jackson's portrayal of a truly terrifying Bible-quotin' gangster was great...up until his \"epiphany.\" He's the only one that deserved an award on this one. I never bought Travolta as a hitman. Thurman is way more sexy in her mind than in fact.All-in-all, an average effort from the Hollywood grist mill, certainly not the earthshattering event it's made out to be. Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has been described as a PF wannabe, but for my money, LS&2SB is 100% more funny and imaginative, the plot is way better and ties up in much more unexpected ways, and is overall a much better film.And I sat down to watch this movie wanting to like it.

    "reviewBody": "This is filmmaking at its apex.  Though I would hardly argue that this film is the greatest, which is what many IMDB users relate after they've just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next \"Titanic\" or \"Matrix\" hype machine bursts their way, I must say that \"Pulp Fiction\" added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s. And who can argue with that? Indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book, and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldn't be more right.  When the film came out, a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipness...Being hip is cool, but I wouldn't necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at \"Men in Black\", which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that \"Pulp Fiction\" has become. So what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd?  It's exactly this spirituality...watching the film, I remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time, being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird California former video clerk's world view.  The film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style; one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" and Roman Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\".  It is the scene where Travolta crashes his Malibu into Eric Stoltz's front yard and brings the OD'ed Thurman inside his house.  As Rosanna Arquette hurls invectives at the two, the camera (wonderful work by Andrez Sekula moves back and forth between Arquette and Travolta and Stoltz lurching over Thurman (that's the Scorsese part).  Then, as Stoltz goes looking for the plunger, the camera follows him into a room, where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of Stoltz, reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in \"Rosemary's Baby\" by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side, making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction.  Such a phrase can be used to describe \"Pulp Fiction\": most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience.  This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action.  I recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over \"Natural Born Killers\".  Now don't get me wrong, Oliver Stone is a powerful filmmaker, but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like \"I'm Going to Use my Artistic License to Satirize the Over-the-Top Violence of Popular Culture by Making a Movie Replete With...Over-the-Top Violence!\"  In the style of David Spade, \"It's called hypocrisy, Oliver--check into it!\"  Anyways, I digress.  Anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema; sure, the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere , but Tarantino fulfilled any filmmaker's dream in revitalizing cinema.  You can say that the film's tone didn't impress you, that its style wasn't to your taste...but you can't deny the artistry that went into it.  Morality? For all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty, I suggest you rent the family favorite \"The Santa Clause\" and count how many times Disney shamelessly milks its own products, or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas film.  Or in ANY family film.  What impressed me the most when I first saw \"Pulp Fiction\" was its inclusion of God at all, many Generation-X filmmakers (paging Kevin Smith?) are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light. You can have those other indie favorites \"Chasing Amy\" and \"Good Will Hunting\"(both starring those irritating crybabies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of \"oh-feel-sorry-for-me\" melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock (best summed up by the Smashing Pumpkins in a \"Simpsons\" episode: \"All's we got is our millions of dollars, our legions of fans, and our youth.\"), then you can have them. Compare that to Jules' awakening (\"I was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when I had what alcoholics refer to as 'a moment of clarity'.\") and you'll see how Tarantino turned the mythic Gen-X stereotype on its head as well. \"Pulp Fiction\" is, in my opinion, the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever.",

    "reviewBody": "To lend myself to the cliche, Tarantino has revolutionized cinema.  Some praise him, some berate him, some despise him, and quite a few lose sight of what he has brought into the mainstream.  In this, his best work to date, Tarantino succeeds in telling one of the most realistic tales ever to find its way into theaters.  It is this realism that makes Tarantino so impressive a director.  While epics like Braveheart and Titanic concern themselves with the most noble points of human existence and morbid thrillers such as Se7en focus on the lowest depths of depravity, Pulp Fiction instead stays firmly in the middle ground of daily experience. The film has been criticized as glorifying violence and drug use.  Instead I feel this movie simply portrays such facets of society, and portrays them very similarly to the \"real world.\"  Pulp Fiction, along with Tarantino's other films, is so captivating because the characters are so very human, more than a collection of catch phrases and a cool exterior.  Tarantino offsets this stark realism with offset chronology, drawing the audience in even further by making them fit the pieces of the plot together in their minds.  Granted, Tarantino was not the first to use the directorial techniques that make Pulp Fiction a fantastic story.  He did not use them first, but he has used them best.  He is so good at what he does that Pulp Fiction is a great movie despite his own acting.  That alone is worthy of an Oscar.",

Great performances abound, but it is Samuel L. Jackson's pre-Jedi Master performance as the spiritually inclined Jules that truly makes this film terrific to watch.  Also a treat are Ving Rhames and Harvey Kietel as the Wolf.  When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I wasn't impressed, but the second time, I realized what a good time I had watching it.

It's not a movie you can just turn on and watch unfocused, though. If you really want to enjoy it you'll probably have to see it three times or more. If you're not planning on doing this, don't watch it! Then of course there's the mystery behind Pulp Fiction. What's in the briefcase? Although plausible theories have been developed, we'll probably never know for sure.

Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Wild & Crazy Ride!",
    "reviewBody": "PULP FICTION is indeed one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. It starts out in a diner where a man and a woman (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discuss armed robberies. The story is then broken off into three distinct strands: the date between a hit man (John Travolta) and his boss's wife (Uma Thurman), an over-the-hill boxer (Bruce Willis) on the run, and the clean-up of a hit man's mistake. The film returns to the diner scene for its ending sequence.If you saw Quentin Tarantino's first (and better) film, RESERVOIR DOGS, you should have no problem following the events of PULP FICTION, which are not told in chronological order.The performances in the film are outstanding, namely by John Travolta, who shines as tough guy hit man, Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant as Vince's partner, Jules Winfield, who reads a bible passage before he kills his next unsuspecting victim.Another strong point in the film was the good writing, which was also strong in RESERVOIR DOGS.Despite the fact that the film produces one of the grossest scenes I have ever witnessed in a film and a slow-moving middle, PULP FICTION still remains a damn good film, snubbed by the Academy when Oscar time rolled around in 1995. Samuel L. Jackson was well deserving of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film did win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, although. GRADE: A-",

    "reviewTitle": "A Refreshing Assault on the Senses",
    "reviewBody": "One of the best independent film ever made, Pulp Fiction is a towering achievement while not really being any good at all. It is a dirty, edgy film which is essentially about nothing other than what it feels like to be in this situation. It is reminiscent of Goodfellas, which has that same almost documentary-like feel to it, and has no definable plot.At the centre of this film however is the acting. Quentin Tarantino draws every ounce of life out of each character and creates an endless series of freaks that you would love to study , but would never want to know. A lot of talk surrounded John Travolta's Oscar loss in this film to Tom Hanks, but it was Samuel L. Jackson who was robbed. He eats the screen alive in every scene - the most famous being in the diner at the end but the best being the hit on Brett (\"Check out the big brain on Brett\") in the first scene after the credits. Even Bruce Willis fits his role as a scheming low-life boxer perfectly.The non-linear story telling and campy feel to this movie work, and make it come across like a crude mating of a 70's cop show, blaxpoitation and a soap opera. But the sharp, witty, original and daring screenplay never misses it's target and not a single scene comes off as forced or awkward.The violence in this movie got a lot of attention at its release, but you cannot convince me that it has anything worse than an episode of NYPD Blue. It really is not that violent. The scenes with Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames and \"the gimp\" are truly offensive and tough to watch, but they are not that violent. That being said, the f-shots in this movie are countless.When you first view Pulp Fiction, so much is thrown at you in such an unconventional way that you may well dislike the film. Give it a second or even third chance. It is well worth it. Pay close attention to the cameos - they make the film. **** out of ****.",

Every time you watch it you will catch more nuances, you will recognize the skill of craftsmanship that went into making this film. I'm not even talking about Tarantino (even though I feel this is his best.) Watch how many details the actors put into their roles, the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue sizzle. Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman are obvious standouts, and Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel are also quite good. Christopher Walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history. So even if you didn't care for it the first time, give it another try. And if you liked it the first time, buy a copy and watch it until it wears out (like mine just did!)",

    "reviewBody": "I was reading some of these posts and decided to put in my two cents worth on the Pulp debate.  Someone stated that they had just seen the movie (in 1999, five years after its release) and could not understand the hype. Well, therein lies the greatest problem facing a film like Pulp Fiction: everything novel and unique it brought to the cinema five years ago has been utterly ransacked by the Hollywood mainstream.  Anyone who saw a film like Bonnie & Clyde 30 years ago will say what an impact the film made on them, when today it seems only like a well constructed gangster film.  Pulp Fiction already seems a little dated because we keep seeing these characters and situations appearing on film.  Sure some of what Tarantino did had been done before.  We'd seen rampant drug use in Drugstore Cowboy, and gangster black comedy in Goodfellas, but Tarantino successfully mixed the dark subject matter with hipness for the nineties, and thusly created the film, and the film revolution that true film lovers had been waiting years for. Pulp Fiction trampled the Hollywood blockbuster industry (remember this was the year of Forrest Gump) and sent studios running to Sundance to find the next big thing.  People who look at Pulp Fiction years after its release are going to have the same reaction one would have after listening to, say, Nirvana's Nevermind:  \"It's good, but I don't get the fuss.\"  Of course you don't.  You have to be there from the beginning to realize just how much of an impact these artists had on EVERYTHING we see and hear today.  People who call Pulp Fiction the greatest film of all time are probably in need of an introduction to a few more films.  Pulp Fiction is not the greatest film ever made.  It is however, the most important film of our generation.",

This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must say 'though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee', it is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the movie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic experience but doesn't necessarily make for a good film. But it isn't so much the action itself as much as the language which achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were unnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might try. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the directorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake).

I even might recall such terms as \"dead n***** storage\" and \"Royale with cheese.\" The only thing I cannot understand is where there is enough genius or wonder about this film to declare it as one of the top 100 best films from the AFI. I'm not arguing that Pulp Fiction is not a terribly original and thoughtful trilogy, but why the huge amount of critical hype? (And by the way, I prefer to call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese.)

But when I saw the movie second time...I was completely blown away. Bruce Willis, as bad as he wants to be, gives everything he got while playing the role of Butch. He is frustrated, angry, scared and out of is mind at the same time. Well, who wouldn't be if he had a mob like Ving Rhames tryin' to catch him... John Travolta and Samuel Jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen. Travolta, a gentleman hoodlum, tries to talk sense to Jackson, who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment. Uma Thurman plays her role like it's in her blood. She plays Mia Wallace, a drug addict and mob's wife. She kinda reminds me of Courtney Love... It is amazing, how Quentin Tarantino can make a conversation about European fast food restaurants sound interesting. Tarantino is genius, I tell you, genius. A three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring, but this is anything but that. Damn, I shouldn't have written this. Now I want to watch it again...",

    "reviewBody": "I can tell you right now not everyone will like this movie. Especially critics, but I personally thought it was brilliant directing.  It was a great idea to put the movie in different order.  This then makes you pay more attention than most movies. Also what I loved and always love about Quentin Tarantino movies is the dialog.  The way a character talks helps me understand the character more which makes the movie easier to understand. Last but not least, its the little things that get me to like a movie. Like the code for the briefcase which is 666, and the bandaid on the back of Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames) neck. Now how did that happen.  Overall I gave this movie an 8.  I always thought Quentin Tarantino would make great movies.",

How about having a story, a point, perhaps.This is one of the few films that actually sends me to sleep.  Take the scene with Bruce Willis.  Could that drawn out boring scene have taken any longer - Dull!!!I, Personally, go to see a movie to be entertained, shocked, moved or informed.  This movie did none of that.  Of course I'm people will say \"you just don't understand the brilliance\".  Just because someone makes an 'Arty' picture doesn't mean you have to pretend to like it even when it's boring.I suspect in the future, when all the hypes forgotten, people will ask, \"why did anyone like that film\".",

    "reviewTitle": "Desperately seeking hipness",
    "reviewBody": "\"You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?\" It's inane, but it's entertaining and it sure seems witty when they're saying it, especially when you learn that this conversation is occurring on the way to knock off a group of possibly armed drug dealers. This is the casual manner in which you would like to talk with your friends and co-workers just before the big event goes down. This is dialogue that makes you feel hip just listening to it.Forget the salvation and redemption bit, this movie is all about making you feel hip. You feel hip when you get to listen in on the clever repartee, hip when you can be titillated by the gratuitous violence but still act blasé about it, hip when the sudden time jump doesn't bother you in the least. This movie makes you feel more hip then any other which has been made in quite a long time.Look beneath the hip surface, however, and you're left with little more than violence as entertainment. Violence in movies works best when used as a necessary device to support the plot, characters, and message. Tarantino reverses this relationship, creating plot and characters purely to support an entertaining sequence of violent situations. Each act of violence has its own specific purpose - make us laugh, make us jump, make us cheer, give us a vicarious thrill - and Tarantino is extremely skilled at making this work. This is the greatest strength of \"Pulp Fiction\", but ultimately its greatest weakness as well.The out-of-sequence scene demonstrates the extent to which the creation of entertaining violence was the driving force of the production. No doubt this was originally intended to be seen in its proper sequence but had to be removed because not only does it add nothing to the plot and character development, it actually bogs things down and gets in the way. Not wanting to lose his biggest laughs, however, Tarantino simply sticks it on the end and has the added bonus of now having a non-traditional narrative simple enough to not confuse his audience but sufficient to make them feel hip for being able to \"appreciate\" it.Is being hip enough? Not to be a classic, at least not in this case. Almost any hip movie is going to be firmly rooted in its own time period, but \"Pulp Fiction\" has lost it much more quickly than others. Although very entertaining and memorable in the initial viewing, its appeal fades quickly. When the hipness is gone, there's nothing left but violence, which doesn't make for a very pleasant viewing experience. Hip classics such as \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"Goldfinger\" stay classics because they still give us fun and adventure even after the hipness has turned to camp. \"Pulp Fiction\" just gets ugly with time. Guns, drugs, and a couple hillbillies right out of \"Deliverance\" aren't enough to make a classic film.",

    "reviewBody": "I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?",

So long as you're over 18 and mentally sound then I recommend it but really, it is only a film after all, if it's a statement of our times, it is only one man's statement (to which of course he's perfectly entitled).",

This is one of the funniest, most enjoyable two hours I've ever spent in a theater.  I went into it halfway expecting not to like it, and I came out a rabid fan.  Samuel L. Jackson is the finest actor in film today, and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map.  Not to mention jump-starting the career of John Travolta! Sure, there's lots of violence and profanity--but that's what makes the movie!  I'm not one of those die-hard Tarantino fans either. (I hated \"Reservoir Dogs\".  Ugh!) My other favorite movie, along with this one, is \"When Harry Met Sally\"! How's that for diversity? I don't understand how anyone could NOT like this movie. It's been imitated many times since, but when it came out it was very different than anything else that had been done. If you find it hard to follow the first time, watch it again.  You'll understand the back-and-forth-in-time concept then. Every performance in it was great--and it has many lines that will be quoted for years to come.  I could've done without Ving Rhames' rape scene, but other than that, it was perfect. 5 out of 5 stars!",

Because he is a rising director, I believe that many of the critics don't want to miss the mark, so they complemented this film far above what it was, Pulp Trash.  Many have said it was John Travolta's greatest film, they missed the mark there also.  Tarantino had a web site about the same time the movie was released to explain to the viewers the nuances of his film.  It was really about saving many people's souls, that is what was in the black briefcase.  I see films like this and all I can think is that the writer got wasted and wrote down his great ideas while he was wasted.

The movie is violent,  a little bloodly (could have been much bloodier),  not highly sexual but the slight glimpses are enough to understand(man raping a man),  and only a little nudity- men in shirts off..bruce willis in underwear.   The movie did not go in chronological order and that was fresh and original.  The acting was good,    Uma Thrurman short on screen role was very moving and her on screen time had the most disturbing image of the entire film with her overdosing.     I was surprised that John Travolta was nominated  for an Oscar because he can act better than what he did in this film(Face Off), he was good but it wasn't special,  it was his usual self.  As for all the talk of redemption...,I think it's kind of a crock,  I mean Samuel L Jackson's character is probaly not all that reliable.     The humour--it didn't work and it wasn't funny.    The people pretty much fit their roles and the movie and sountrack was good,  but I don't really see the big deal of it. Watch for film for a new experience but don't go in thinking the movie is highly enjoyable.  8/10 for a well made and original film.",

With so many lines which will be repeated long after you see this movie, it is pretty much an instant classic.I've seen Pulp Fiction more times than I can count (Probably about 50) and it's the only film that I can still get joy out of after seeing it that many times. I was terribly confused as to what transpired the first time I saw it, but then after a few more viewings I began to realize the genius in this film isn't that Tarantino makes the viewer understand the film, he makes the viewer love it. From the \"Big brain on Brad\" scene until the \"Bad Mother F--ker\" scene, this movie aims to please. In that sense it is probably the anti-classic, but since we already have a surplus of sex, drugs, and violence in film and on television why not just roll them all into one, multiply by one hundred, and make a movie out of it.Unfortunately this will probably be Tarantino's last great film judging from the pathetic aftershock which turned out to be Jackie Brown.",

The frame in this case is the Diner which is where, like Chaucer's inn, the main characters meet.  In between we get mini-story's like Butch's tale (the Knight if you will), Vincent's tale (the Sailor) and Jules' tale (the Monk).  Each is interwoven with the other except that chronologically, they are out of synch (Butch wastes Vincent in his tale but Vincent is in the Diner frame part of the story).  The dialog is sharp and has some serious hidden meanings at times--Tarintino is notorious, like Stephen King, for lacing the dialog with pop-culture references.  Witness the scene outside Jack Rabbit Slims where Mia asks Vincent \"You're not a square Daddy-O are you?\" and proceeds to \"draw\" a square in the air ala Pebbles Flintstone.  This blurring of the film's reality with our reality lets you know Tarintino is not some by the books director with no sense of what \"Joe Bagofdonuts\" does--he watches TV too!  Kevin Williamson's re-writing of the horror film rules owes alot to \"Pulp Fiction\" and it's acknowledgement of just who is going to see movies these days.

    "reviewBody": "Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the \"story\" meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind.",

The dialogue is snappy and sharp, the acting is brilliant and the story is so clever. Basically, the whole story is based around a crime boss(Rhames) and his mysterious brief case. We start off the film with Mr Roth and his partner robbing a diner, and from that moment on, the audience can sit back and stare in amazement at the talent shown on screen. All the stars give a career best. There are superb confrontations between the actors-Mr Rhames and Mr Willis, Mr Jackson and Mr Roth, Mr Willis and Mr Travolta, Mr Travolta and Ms.Thurman, Mr Keitel and Mr Tarantino and Mr Jackson and Mr Travolta. It leaves the audience wondering who knows who and for what reason. Its the exact intelligence that made Jackie Brown so tremendous. Rating=5/5",

    "reviewTitle": "Crap Fiction!",
    "reviewBody": "In a nutshell, the following elements causes a movie to be hyped beyond its own good:1.  Early trailers showing a movie with a huge cast, sex, drugs, and violence from a director who made an earlier hit and an underground genre as its subject.2.  After the trailer, it will respectively draw people in like sheep to see it.3. Sooner or later, there's a controversy about the movie's content, and yet it is still being raved about. Sooner or later the Academy of Motion pictures will knock on the director's door based on the amount  of sheep-people who love it.  It becomes a classic, and to those rare cases of actual humanoid lifeforms like myself, it's a hoopla B.S.Essentially, it's the hype that made this movie. If a film student approached a producer with the same idea, he'd get the hand. If you're Quentin Tarantino, you'd get Caviar and a warm welcome.  First of all, I didn't care for any one these characters. And where's the plot? Ooh, who needs one? Just turn these con men into philosophy majors, and have them drive around using four letter words all the time. Then make a bunch of vignettes out of this \"plot\"! Someone gets a big needle poked through their chest because they overdosed on cocaine! Ooh, shocking! Pump up the hype! They took the scientologist star of Saturday Night Fever and made him disco dance again! With Uma Thurman yet! Some shocking stuff here! But what does it all mean? Is it supposed to prove that even the most sleazy  people are smart and intelligent? Does it mean rape in a VCR repair store could be a hype getter in another movie? Could it mean that the \"N\" word is okay to use as long as your name is Quentin Tarantino and you're just making a movie?The emperor has no clothes. Or is it the hitman has no clothes? Or the drug dealer has no clothes? Whatever.",

    "reviewTitle": "Clever, tough, funny, brilliant. A gem.",
    "reviewBody": "This is a great movie.  Quentin Tarantino who decided to break down his movie into four little stories did a great job at it.  Plus, he added everything in it that was necessary without overdoing anything.  Sure some of the scenes are rough but there isn't a scene in the movie where you can say \"Well that's a little too much\" unless you hate violence.  But what is great about this movie as well is that Tarantino somewhat copied Hitchcock (Be forewarned, I'm giving away some scenes in the movie so if you haven't seen it, skip this part, read the last paragraph and read this after you've seen it.  However, if you don't mind having a few scenes spoiled before seeing the movie, go ahead, be my guest and read this).When Travolta stabs Uma Thurman with the needle, Tarantino did like Hitchcock used to do: He makes you think it's going to be very gory and sick but there isn't a drop of blood.When Ving Rhames crosses the street, stares at Bruce Willis, curses at him and then gets run over by Bruce Willis, Tarantino copied a little the scene in \"Psycho\" when Janet Leigh's boss crosses the street and sees her in her car when he thinks she's home resting.  So, this said, the movie is really great.  Personally, I felt that Travolta should have won the Oscar for best actor that year instead of Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\".  It's an excellent crime movie.",

That didn't stop me from enjoying it though.Pulp Fiction weaves three character-related stories together. Each story is fairly unremarkable and couldn't sustain a feature but it's the fabulous dialogue and the actors delivery that makes it entertaining.\nJohn Travolta is great as Vincent Vega. He gets to play a large part in the first and final stories and has a cameo in the second. He oozes class as Samuel L Jackson's partner and delivers his lines like their his own words. Bruce Willis proves to be more than just an action hero with a less explosive but still vest wearing part. Uma Thurman pulls off a small but impressive performance. Harvey Keitel and Eric Stoltz have the best cameo roles and Quentin Tarantino isn't bad as Jimmy.But this film belongs to Jackson. He lights up the screen whether he's quoting from the Bible or eating a hamburger. He was born for his part. The three stories should have been all about him.There isn't much more to be said. We all know Quentin Tarantino can write (True Romance) and we know he can direct (Reservoir Dogs). Let's hope there's a few more characters still lurking in that sick head of his.",

    "reviewTitle": "The path of the righteous man.....",
    "reviewBody": "I don't have enough space here to point out all of the misconceptions about Pulp Fiction so I'll just give everybody my take on the film and its message. Pulp Fiction is a truly brilliant film that few people will ever completely understand. Pulp Fiction covers everything from social satire to morality to just good old fashion movie fun. First of all I would like to explain the bible verse that Jules reads (Ezekeil 25:17) and how it applies to the story. Jules is \"the righteous man\", Vincent is \"the selfish\", and Marsellus represents \"the tyranny of evil men.\" Jules is \"beset on all sides\" by this negativity and must find it in himself to overcome it. Jules, in the end finds redemption, where Vince and Marsellus have the vengance of the lord layed upon them for their sins. This is just one layer of a great story. Perhaps that's the brilliance of Pulp Fiction: the various layers that the film can be enjoyed on. Pulp Fiction is the Citizen Kane of the 90's....It has changed filmaking like few others. The acting in Pulp Fiction makes it seem like the actors were just born to play their roles in the movie. Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson give a couple of the finest performances in screen history. The Social satire and Quentin's great direction only fuel the fire. It's just too bad that the subject matter of the film turn people away from Pulp Fiction, because those people are really restricting themselves. Pulp Fiction is my all-tie favorite film and I believe that in 10 or 15 years it will go down as the greatest film ever made. 10 out of 10",

Jackson and Uma Thurman. I think the first and the last moments of the movie are only some of the best moments of Cinema that I saw in my life I think it's incredible how a great movie like \"Pulp Fiction\" didn't won the Oscar of best movie of the year losing to the good but not excellent \"Forrest Gump\". \"Pulp Fiction\" isn't only one of the best movies of the 90's, it is for me one of the best movies of ever",

If it's hip to think that this celebration of evil is cool, then I want to be as unhip as possible. Being a teacher of modern German and Russian history, you might say I'm not inclined to see physical brutality as entertainment.

    "reviewTitle": "The appeal of this movie escapes me",
    "reviewBody": "This oddly intertwined series of tales is chiefly about two professional assassins, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and their misadventures in the world of murder, crime, and taking the boss's wife out to eat.  (Trust me, this is not as funny as it sounds). Haphazardly intermixed with this is the story of the boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and of Butch (Bruce Willis), a boxer who refuses to throw a fight for Wallace and thus earns his enmity.Some things are not wrong with PULP FICTION.  I do not believe, as some do, that it is intended to glorify violence and drug abuse.  It does play both these things for comic effect, in what I found a very tasteless, vulgar, and unfunny style, but I don't think Tarantino was trying to tell the audience that violence and drug abuse are actually fun and beneficial; inconvenient and inglorious consequences of both are shown quite graphically.  And the acting by Jackson, Rhames, and, yes, Willis is pretty darn good.Nevertheless, PULP FICTION bored me out of my mind.  I was not interested in the characters, because none of them is sympathetic; none feels about the world or reacts to it in any way remotely approaching my own.  And much of the movie is spent in long dialogue that does nothing to advance the plot. To be fair, Tarantino does have an ear for realistic, earthy-sounding phrases.  The lines never sound artificial, forced or strained; they do sound just like the spontaneous banalities that form the backbone of real people's conversations.  But I don't listen to strangers' banal conversations, because they're boring if I don't know the people.  And that's exactly how boring the conversations in PULP FICTION are.PULP FICTION's genius is generally said to lie in its accomplishments as a black comedy.  Well, whatever floats your boat.  I got very few laughs out of this picture.  Interestingly, I always find my friends' re-enactments of their favorite scenes from PULP FICTION to be much funnier than seeing the scenes themselves.  I was amused twice in the final tale by Tarantino's spoofing of movie cliches, as where Jules urged Honeybunny to \"stay calm, point the gun at me,\" and where a hapless gunman misses Jules and Vincent with an entire magazine at point blank range, much to all parties' amazement.  But aside from that, the comedy eluded me.  I don't know how anyone could hail lower than lowbrow humor like Christopher Walken's scene as being some kind of comic genius.  Furthermore, realistically brutal violence and comedy don't mix well for my taste.Tarantino does have some imagination handling the camera.  For instance, Vincent at one point is told that Marsellus Wallace had a man thrown off a building for massaging Mrs. Wallace's feet; later, when Vincent meets Mrs. Wallace on orders to take her to a restaurant, the camera never leaves Mrs. Wallace's feet.But Tarantino's imagination often is no more than showing off.  The film's structure appeals to the sort of over-literate viewer for whom the word \"nonlinear\" is synonymous with \"brilliant\" and \"artistic.\"  Not to be a spoilsport, but there's a good reason most movie scripts are arranged in a linear fashion: that happens to be the way time flows.  I'm not saying you can't tell a good nonlinear story, but there'd better be a reason for it. And I cannot tell what Tarantino thinks he accomplished by mixing at least five (counting the opening scene) different time sequences together in a seemingly random order.  I was not confused, but many others were, and I don't see what Tarantino gained in exchange for losing them.  One reviewer has suggested this device enabled Tarantino to put Jules' \"redemption\" at the end, thus finishing the movie on a positive note.  If this is so, then the conclusion is just as manipulative and intellectually dishonest as any standard tacked-on Hollywood feel-good ending.Not that the ending is really bad; in fact I gave the movie an extra half star for its ending, as I finally became interested in one of the characters.  I would have liked to find out whether Jules succeeded in leaving the criminal life.  Of course, I take self-confessed \"redemptions\" with a grain of salt, but since Jules seems to be uncertain himself about whether he'll kick the criminal habit, I can live with that.  But redeemed or not, Jackson couldn't completely redeem this frequently tedious, sometimes nauseating, and rarely funny two and a half hours.Rating: ** out of ****.",

But we could have done without the Deliverance stuff in the pawn shop, and I think the shootings were rather gratuitous too. The characters spent a lotta time talking about McDonalds in Paris and what, the Brady Bunch? Pop culture references, which suddenly became the rage in Hollywood, which if not handled right will make you sick.I give Tarentino credit for stealing from all the right places, and for putting the stuff together to make for an entertaining film, though it will make you wince or cringe or whatever at times. But it isn't exactly an Oscar caliber film to my thinking, if you want that, go check out Lonestar.*** outta ****, not as bad as it could have been.",

Jackson is superb as Bible-quoting killer, with a nice comeback by Travolta.  Not for weak stomachs or those seeking a formula plot.  The kind of movie that spawns substandard imitations.",

    "reviewBody": "You don't go and see a Tarantino written film without expecting to see guns, gore, vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence. It is his style and he is a master at it. The fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself. This particular film was well written (Kudos to Roger Avary for helping Tarantino). The film is definitely Oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots. Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Director to name a few. Unfortunately I believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards, but Tarantino and Avary did get Oscars for Writing it.Their is talk about quarter pounders in France, foot massages and what it's like to kill a person. If you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence, rape and drug use you are probably a Tarantino fan already.Finally who cares where Tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be, and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans. Travolta, Jackson, Willis, Rames and Thurman have my highest regards for a job well done. I give the film a 10 out of 10.   >",

I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being \"cool\" and trying to have \"catch phrases,\" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as \"daring\" \"good\" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and \"Do the Right Thing\" for my least favorite \"good\" movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Take 'im down to the kennel and sick the dogs on and we'll find out what he knows!",
    "reviewBody": "Warning: does contain spoilers.Before I go into how great this film is, I have to first tell you something that I know everyone thinks but so few have commented on, and that is the performance of Ving Rhames.  For those of you that have seen this film, you all know what I am going to say is the gospel, for those of you that haven't, if you ever see a film for a singular performance, see two films. One is Tombstone because of Val Kilmer and the other is Pulp Fiction for Rhames.  His portrayal of Marcellus Wallace is one of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures.  His mannerisms, his dialect, his virility, his coolness and his ruthlessness all should have given him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, even over Samuel Jackson.  Just think back to some of this lines, some of his actions and some of his facial expressions.  This is the epitome of greatness and if I could pick 5 performances in the history of film that are the embodiment of powerful interpretations and believability, this would easily be up there. Just look at the scene when Jules talks to him after the Marvin problem. Jules is freaking out and Wallace calmly responds \" I'm on the m*****f***a, go back inside and chill them niggas out, I'm sending in tha Wolf. \"  As he delivers the line he is serenely sitting in his backyard with his cool shades covering his malicious eyes and he is wiping his mouth with an expensive hanky.  His delivery is perfect and when you listen to him you don't think this is a ruthless killer, he is just a guy next door with a very nice house.  And what makes it even better is that they are two gangsters talking about alleviating the Bonnie situation before she gets home.  These are two bad ass criminals that are in the business of killing people and they are attempting to save a man's marriage by removing a dead body from the garage.  That is just dripping with contradictions, but it works because of the writing and because of the delivery, mostly by Rhames. Another scene that demonstrates his grasp of his character is the rape scene.  When he finally gets around to his comeuppance against \" Billy Boy \", he spits out his dialogue with such venom that while you are cheering his triumph, you are actually worried for Zed and his soon-to-be-living-his-shortass-life-in-agonizing-pain-rapist situation.  And then when he talks to Butch, he is fair and thankful for Butch's assistance but cannot forget how Butch betrayed him.  \" Oh that what now.  I'll tell you what now.  There is no me and you.  You leave town tonight and when you be gone you stay gone.  You lost all your L.A. privledges. \"  Ving Rhames is my favourite part of the film ( besides the ridiculously intelligent and original script ) and quoting him is now a daily regimen at work with my other friends that like the film.  I think Tarantino is so smart for casting Rhames in this role and what it makes it that much better is knowing that Rhames is one of the most humble men in Hollywood, remember when he gave back his Emmy to Jack Lemmon as he tearfully said that he hadn't paid enough dues yet and Lemmon was one of his idols?  The man can do no wrong in my eyes.  He is one of a kind.As for the rest of Pulp Fiction, this is a film that will often be imitated but never duplicated.  That is an old cliche but it is so true in this case. It is completely original and without a doubt, what makes it so original and so great is simply the writing.  What other film can have gangsters talking about foot massages and the importance of them just before they are about to perform a hit.  What other film can describe in great detail what a pilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all before entering into a room to ramble on about the Bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with extreme prejudice.  There is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film.  Pulp fiction takes violence and surrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some strange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared car with domesticated products that are located under Jimmy's sink, oral pleasure, speaking Bora Bora, getting day jobs as opposed to robbing banks, being cool like Fonzie and five dollar milkshakes.  How and where Tarantino thought of this script is beyond me, all I know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that I have seen Pulp Fiction.  I can understand why this film was passed over at the Oscars for Forrest Gump, but in most people's opinion this was the best film of 1994.  I loved Gump and Shawshank Redemption but I also loved Pulp Fiction and if it would have won Best Picture that year I would have been just as happy.  Pulp Fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be remembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200 years ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) Pulp Fiction is going to be one of them mentioned.  When you can have Christopher Walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have Travolta and Jackson talk about walking the Earth like Kane in Kung Fu, have Eric Stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a shot to an O.D-ing Uma Thurman, have Harvey Keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 8:00 AM and then appear on the scene to \"solve problems\" have Tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy stuff his wife buys, have Bruce Willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have Ving Rhames talk about having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and \"pop a cap\" in someone's ass if he shows up in Indo-China and have it all make sense, well you have something special.  Pulp Fiction isn't a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true film fans.  This may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life and they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some Hollywood films.  This is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen and paper.  It redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and a half hours. I did, immensely, and I think most people will, and have.  If you really have not seen this, then you are robbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film.  This is easily one of the best films ever made.  How anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and I can't see how you can truly call yourself a film fan if you can't see the brilliance of this film.",

I will admit that there is a lot to see in Avary and Tarantino's script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jackson's character. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest of the movie I wasn't so happy with. Pulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas which also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesn't look that original. But I will admit that the story in Pulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very powerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma Thurman's part which I felt was filling time. I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the \"N\" word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on the violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone.",

A kid's face is blown off by mistake - and our heroes only worry that his splattered brains spoils their hair.

    "reviewBody": "Although it had some competition \"Pulp Fiction\" is my choice for best film of the 90's! \"Forrest Gump\", \"GoodFellas\", and \"Fargo\", all came close, but none measure up to this Tarantino classic. Everything in this movie is as good as it gets. The screenplay is amazing, winning \"Pulp\" it's ONLY acadamy award of 1994. Most all of the awards it should have won were stolen away by one of my earlier mentioned, honorable mentions for best 90's film \"Forrest Gump\" which truly is a classic, but isn't on the level of \"Pulp\". Overall, the script is marvoulsly written and put together by Tarantino and Avary.The acting spawned numerous acadamy award nominations, but suprisingly didn't win any. Samuel L. Jackson definetly gives a worthy performance as the bible quoting, \"N\" word saying hit man Jules that changes his thoughts about his career after what he calls a divine intervention. John Travalto proves he truly is the comeback kid  also earning a nomination for his Elvis-Man,Vicent, type hitman who gets blown away in the bathroom, but still appears in the end of the film, because of how the script is written. (For some reason Tarantino makes all of his characters in all of his movies wind up in the bathroom to create interesting situations. Roth and Bushemi in \"Dogs\". Jackson, Thurman, and Travolta in \"Pulp\", and, well, I don't remember one in \"Jackie Brown\". Oh Well, No Matter.) Bruce Willis is particularly fun and powerful as Butch in the seen where he stumbles into the wrong store at the wrong time. Along side him is Ving Rhames in an equally powerful performance as Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman plays Mia, Mea, however you spell it, the wife of Marcellas, who, when unable to handle a hit,is ran around all over every where, leading up to a highly intense adrenaline shot seen. Christopher Walken makes a funny cameo, Harvey Kietel does, too. Even Tarantino himself makes a cameo as Jimmy. All in all, all the suprising twists and turns, and breathtaking action/violence make \"Pulp Fiction an instant classic!",

They are VINCENT VEGA (Travolta) JULES (Jackson) and a host of others, namely BRUCE WILLIS, UMA THURMAN, and HARVEY KEITEL. The film is told in a very non-linear format, with the end in the middle and the start at the end etc. But the stories are incredibly well-written and woven. In Pulp you will witness scenes with some of the finest dialogue ever!! Tarantino is clearly very talented and it shines through here.SCENES TO LOOK OUT FOR: Butch Coolidge (WILLIS) deciding what weapon to use to kill the rapists.Travolta accidentally shooting Marvin in the faceA lovely cameo by Tarantino as JIMMIEPumpkin and Honeybunny in the restaurantSamuel L.Jackson's bible recites.Overall the plot is very well done.CAST: Packed full of stars, the cast of PF is an excellent one. Great actors and actresses put in career performances with a little help from Tarantino. Willis and Jackson are the main men, but Ving Rhames is excellent. Christopher Walken and Steve Buscemi make excellent cameos along with Tarantino. Thurman was good yet under-used. Travolta was fairly cool. To be fair, there was not much wrong with the film's actors at all. A good choice of cast: WELL DONE!Warning: The film, whilst not glorifying violence or drug abuse, has some strong drug and violence scenes. Despite this, it is a funny and entertaining film, but if u r easily offended by the previous elements, have caution. BUT DONT LET IT RUIN THIS EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME! Watch PF right now!Mark: 9.5/10(Only because maybe nothin in life is 100% perfect)",

    "reviewBody": "I'm sure everyone has covered the obvious genius of this movie, so I'm just going to write about the little things I enjoy.I'm sure many people love to see this movie over and over again, but since I have so many things memorized (as all of you, I'm sure, Don't Lie!!) I like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time. Too bad it can never be as fresh as the first time, but the exhiliration and thrill is still there.It's so cool how Tarantino can put everything he loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew. Not to mention surf guitar and cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and ridiculousness of it all.I also like how Quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so viewings. You might not have noticed (or even have cared for that matter), but in almost every scene there's a little thing going, sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip, ultraviolent cult fave. I like how the scene involving Christopher Walken and the young Butch. Walken almost changes every word in explaining Butch's father's death for the sake of Butch and his mother. Also at the end, if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt, they look like real bystanders in a hold-up.I also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine them outside the movie. Like Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz. I always imagine them getting high and cheating on each other. Not to mention Tarantino putting questions out there for us. What is in that suitcase after all?",

I've said goodbye to those pathetic action and comedy movies. I began to see the films of Bergman, Scorsese, DeNiro, Kubrick, Altman. The list goes on and on. 10 out of 10.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction definitely is a knockout film. Apart from the intelligent, original and refreshing chronological intertwine of different storylines, the brilliant script is a gem. It succeeds in making the mix of absurdly gross and directly shot violence and all day chit-chat more than believable. Where else have you seen a guy commenting on the quality of his victim-to-be's Kahunaburger and asking him a sip of his beverage to wash it down seconds before pumping everyone in the room full-o-lead  ? When did you last see a scene in which one of the 2 bad guys accidently \"erase\" their captive's brains during a car ride and then discuss the mess it creates, the bump in the road that caused this and who's supposed to clean up, without worrying even the slightest about the man's death ? Not to speak of Walken in a small role handing Willis the watch that, according to his monologue, sat years in someone's there-where-the-sun-don't-shine before being handed on, without being completely unbelievable ? All this completed with a cool worth-wile soundtrack (very retro-sixties/seventies), a great well-picked cast and the magic Tarantino touch, this movie ROCKS.",

    "reviewBody": "Pulp Fiction is one of those wonderfully compelling, beautifully written, absurdly unpredictable films that come along every now and again.The subject matter, -a pot-pourri of various low-life scumbags' and their daily doings, is so lovingly crafted. Each story and set piece so silkily woven around an underbelly that is usually used to coarser a cloth.No member of the cast is found wanting. No part of the storyline a disappointment. If violent movies have to be made, then this is the way to make them. The cartoonish manner of both characterization and action makes it far more digestible than films such as Goodfellas.A special mention for Samuel L Jackson. He is the axle on which the whole thing turns. I think he was highly underestimated and was generally crowded out in the plaudits by supporters of cinema's prodigal son,- John Travolta.Score 9/10",

He is very aware of his one directing, Tarantino, and he seems like a very intelligent person. Therefore I say that Pulp Fiction is a movie, that indeed deserves 10 stars.",

I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend!

    "reviewBody": "I can't, I can't. The whole studio was screaming from the beginning until end of the movie, this movie was so perfect, Epic, Awesome and I can't even describe it. When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until now the visual, edit, it so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause they visual look great like a game. I still can't believe it's look like what fans theory said and fan made I can't.I really enjoyed the movie the credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked, shacking, that's was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me to HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I was really wanna cry cause it was so good. I can't stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I really wanna watch it again. And venom part I thought he was going to help or fight the spiderman, but he was give a venom to MCU. This movie was one of the saddest MCU movies ever I'm so sad when aunt may died, and everyone forget about Peter Parker. At the end Peter Parker was make a new suit and the suit it's really looked like the other spiderman movie. This was so on fire!!!!!.I've watch this 3 times and there's some scene not make sense but this movie still so so so good... like when The girl From MIT open her seatbelt and then when Car want to fall she was use the seatbelt. And Spiderman costum when Dr otto Break his costume The Middle of The costume was break, and when green goblin come The suit was not full, idk why but maybe cause when he fully his costum to save him From Dr otto maybe cause he didn't use The Mask so The custom was full in his body and when he use The Mask his Middle custome was break.Edit : I've been thinking about this like a month I think no way home VFX it's not that good I mean it was really look like a fan made edits.",

    "reviewTitle": "Everything I wanted and more",
    "reviewBody": "Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters \"Uncle Ben\" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!",

May's death is a beautiful scene left for as long as it should have and Tom Holland is brilliant.4. Every character from the multiverse felt like themselves and Andrew's performance solidified his Peter as the most comic accurate.5. Even though it is a multiverse movie (which can get confusing) you still understand everything and it all makes sense.6. This is Tom Holland's film even with the two Spider-Men, they still make sure he is the main focus.7. The grief Peter goes through is perfectly pictured and Andrew's Peter described that he had that feeling after Gwen's death.Overall the best Spider-Man film and best MCU film to date.",

    "reviewBody": "Updated with spoilers:\nThis is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long \"trailer\", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Biggest, Grandest And Most Exhilarating Spidey Flick Ever Appeared On Big Screen!",
    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -\nMovie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*",

    "reviewBody": "NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you \"hey, I'm here, remember?\". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It's not a perfect film. It's still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is great. It really is great. This movie have a lot of villians but that doesn't hurt it not at all. I must say by far the best MCU spider-man film to date. They handle the question of revenge so great I think. The ending is just yeah phenomenal. I don't even know what to say barely left the theater before I started to write this both Tobey and Andrew back. (sorry Nicholas Hammond maybe next time). If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs. It is great watch it if you haven't. Honestly you shouldn't even read this if you haven't watched it.",

    "reviewBody": "Just because we get to see all 3 Spider-Man in the film doesn't make it the perfect Spiderman movie.I thought that the plot move really quickly, to give the film plenty of time to explore the returning villains, which is good. But for a movie with 5/6 villains, there are only 2 action sequences, and a very underwhelming climax.Surely, they could have done more paying tribute to the old films, and at the same time adding the new one to the mix. The ending feel little rush, and feels too family friendly.Nonetheless, respect for Kevin to finally bring all 3 Spideys to the big screen.",

Tom does his best performance since \"The Impossible\" and made me love his more mature Spidey. Finally, he suffers consequences, gets gritty and fights with fists!I loved Charlie Cox's cameo and hope they either resurrect his series or that Daredevil will get his own movies.I had a wish for more cameos, such as Topher Grace, Kirsten Dunst and Rosemarry Harris but you can't get it all.

    "reviewTitle": "The greatest Spider-Man movie ever and amazing ending (and beginning) of a trilogy.",
    "reviewBody": "This movie was seriously amazing, the CGI looked insanely good compared to the other movies with spidey in it. The fight scenes are absolute remarkable and so is the emotions that it gave. Of course, I'll just say it, Tobey and Andrew being in this movie really made it something, the nostalgic references they made (for example Tobey speaking about his back and them talking about how he has organic webs.)But it's not just that Tobey and Andrew being in it that made it great. We finally get to see a big leap in Tom Holland and even though the green goblin technically isn't his enemy from the start it became personal when Tom had to witness Aunt May die (truly saddening scene. I also love how they finally used Uncle Ben's quote, \"with great power comes great responsibility.\")I'm going to finish this review off by talking about the ending and the future of MCU Spider-Man. The last fight was absolutely remarkable, a hand-to-hand combat with heavy and emotional punches, and you could see how feelings got to Tom when he nearly stabbed Osborn, but Tobey stopped him. It was a perfect moment, no words, just them looking at each other because they had a connection in how it is to be overtaken, they understood each other, and it was honestly beautiful.So the future of Spider-Man is looking extremely promising, thanks to Toms incredible sacrifice of making everyone forget that Peter exists and that there is only Spider-Man was an excellent step for Toms Spider-Man. I'm happy to see that he has grown from the Iron Boy Jr. To Spider-Man.Him living by himself now off to college with what seems to be a new darker tone (and an amazing new suit, finally a better symbol) really excites me for the next trilogy coming.",

Here they had a lot of opportunities to bring in the old tunes but I felt that the music never really kicked inThe bluetooth controlled arms?Doc Ock coming to terms with his mistakes in Spider-Man 2 and overpowering the evil AI with pure will power was the coolest thing.Here the AI in Peters suit hacked Doc Ocks robotic arms, put them both down and then restrained the arms.This is the real AI to worry about.Overall the movie was entertaining but a lot of things felt rushed. Bringing back the old guys was a great move I will give them that, this is also what raises the score for me.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spider-Man: No Way Home, my first review",
    "reviewBody": "How long has Spider-Man: No Way Home been buzzing around social media for? Take a moment to appreciate how much of an impact the build-up for this epic finale to Tom Holland's Spider-Man trilogy had on not only the die hard MCU fans, but also the audience who were brought out of the woodworks to reinstate just how much of an impact the classic Spider-Man comics had on their lives. There was certainly no new news to what we expected from this film, in that almost every fan theory was precisely calculated, as well as knowing how we were going to expect a thrill ride of an adventure, and No Way Home is definitely no stranger to forcing you to eye the screen with your full concentration for the entirety of the runtime.A film directed by Jon Watts, Spider-Man: No Way Home focuses on the ramifications of the leaked identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) after successfully defeating Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), directly following on from the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home. The movie opens up with the immediate reactions of the general public and consequences slowly begin to follow up, such as Peter, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon) failing to be accepted admission into M. I. T, directly delving deeper into the controversy surrounding the perceived identity of Peter Parker, advertised none other than J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons). Peter is now a criminal.After experiencing his persona being tarnished, Peter approaches Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and requests that a spell be cast on the entire world to ensure that everyone forgets who Peter Parker is, which expectedly with all of Peter's requests to tamper with the spell backfires. Quickly moving on from Peter's problems and slowly into what the audience was wanting from the film, we see familiar faces such as Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), previously from the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films. It is now in Peter's favor to undo the entrances of all these characters coming from alternate universes with the help of his friends MJ and Ned.The links with the previous Spider-Man films was certainly the most compelling and intricate idea to bring together a multitude of characters, a personal highlight for me was to see Willem Dafoe reprise the iconic role of Norman Osbourne, and reliving the insanity and his incredible skill as an actor, as well as dropping the iconic line of \"you know, I'm something of a scientist myself\" to draw laughs from the audience taking inspiration from the iconic internet meme it became. It's with utmost confidence that the majority of the MCU's superhero movies are fairly predictable in how they execute their stories to the audience, however No Way Home trusts that although a lot of the film has been predetermined, it uses the iconic phrase of \"with great power comes great responsibility\" and the connection with the previous franchises adds significant depth to the film.The massive beat to this film are the returns of both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker from other dimensions. What impressed me about how they were brought into this film was that it wasn't an immediate 'wow' moment. This is because the audience wasn't already on the edge of a seat during an intense action sequence when they were revealed. Instead, Watts decided to bring them into the movie slowly with some humor attached to it.The climax of the film is fairly fluid and slick in terms of action and while it was not the final battle we expected in terms of excitement, there was still an emotional aspect to be considered after witnessing the death of Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) so the film didn't have any place to get us out of our seats too quickly, but just to enjoy the ride while it lasted. It doesn't succumb to anything too over the top such as the final battle in Avengers: Endgame.Expanding a bit on the influence of marketing a film to your audience before it's release, the question to be asked was how surprised were you when you finally saw Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield finally appear on screen? These so-called fan theories of other Spider-Man's appearing in a scene as well as leaked photos of all three Spider-Man's in a picture together added too much credibility to this being the 'big reveal' in the film. It's certainly a difficult process to be able to hide all these secrets however one important thing to note when it comes to viewing anything for the first time is that social media 'hype' can actually have a much more everlasting and detrimental effect on your overall perceptions and thoughts about a film once you have seen it for yourself and with all of this in mind. And Spider-Man: No Way Home was definitely one of those films that fell right into that trap.At the end of the film, my overall feelings were that from what I had witnessed during the events leading towards this film I would have expected a much more satisfying feeling leaving that cinema, because all the press and promotion that took place before the final release of the film along with all the fan-theories had created so many holes to fill. Now, that's nothing to say this is a negative review of some sort as this film went above and beyond to articulate some of the most revolutionary feats anyone has seen in an MCU film or any film in general. However, one thing for certain is that the build-up of a film is a massive factor and plays a huge part in how we see Spider-Man: No Way Home as a film overall.. That's the main problem with a film that becomes far too popular amidst fans, that as it is so highly anticipated within the industry it becomes too much of an expectation theory, in that what you expect to see on the screen tends to be far over the limit to what you actually get.Spider-Man: No Way Home could be argued as 'cinematic history' bringing together generations of characters lasting since 2002, and the cast and crew did an amazing job to reunite such a humongous community of fans to enjoy probably one of the most impressive feats the MCU have ever pulled off. My only wish was that there wasn't as much social media buzz about this film, as I reckon it could have been a better experience overall had all these fan theories and leaks gone out the window. But this film, it had a unique concept, and that's what counts.",

    "reviewBody": "Booked the day off to see this today as did NOT want to be spoiled ha, and it was totally worth it.If anyone is curious, and hasn't seen it yet - yep Toby and Andrew are back. Their 'revelation' was actually really cute, and not what I'd expected before going in (still wasn't convinced they were 100% in it - but I did think it might happen when Holland fails to catch MJ, one of the others sweeps in and gets her. Spoiler - they're in way before that). One really nice surprise was the amount of Toby/Andrew we had. It's made me miss them. Their banter was cute af and it was nice to see emotion from their own films being brought into this movie.One criticism I have, or an unfulfilled wish I suppose - is that I wish we'd have had more insight into their current lives, beyond what we'd seen. We get a hint from Toby that him and MJ are still together but I wanted more ha.I think as I was watching it I realised it's literally only the audience that this is exciting for; the characters have absolutely no reference to each other so there's a lack of 'surprise' if you like - between each of the SpiderMan/any other character. This could've potentially been resolved by having supporting characters like MJ for Toby or maybe Aunt May for Andrew. Maybe not them, but some way for the characters to interact in a way that wasn't as complete strangers. The villains don't give much of that.Another thing that wasn't my fav, was the villain story. It wasn't terrible AT ALL, but I just didn't get why Tom was so adamant to save them from dying; when he knew they were villains. I know he doesn't want to kill, but it seemed weak to assume he'd be that invested when he obviously just needed to get them back home. And it also was a bit confusing after all the excitement of T&A's return, what the 3 SpiderMen had agreed to do. I sort of had to guess as it was happening.The ending was brilliant, in my opinion. There was real emotion with Zendaya and Tom - and it opens up the next movies with some real questions. It could even close the Tom era, if that was the way they decided to go/Holland didn't want to return.I don't think anyone will be let down by this movie, even though our expectations have been built up to be absolutely enormous. It delivers. Maybe not as you expect but that's probably good as well as less so.Enjoy!",

The bigger MCU becomes, a lot of things have to compromise with the big picture. It creates a lot of ripples that don't match the flow. Hence it becomes forced and harder to keep the consistency than how it should be.Fight scenes are moderate, nothing spectacular except Dr Strange one's. A lot of cringe dialogues, scenes, and characters inconsistency. Again, too forced.Maybe a lot of fans will still root for NWH as it is a fine fan service after all. But as a movie itself, it is not good enough. Anything notable is William Dafoe's performance.It is nothing like what a fan boasts, that it levels with Endgame. No, not even close.",

His acting is absolutely top notch (as opposed to most of the other villains, mainly Jamie Foxx), and he carries the movie on his shoulders.The references are everywhere, it's obvious fan service and it works, that's what you want from such a movie.I'm glad they stayed true to the original spidermen and didn't try to make them cooler than they were. I cringed hard during most of their scenes together for how lame they were, but it made so much sense with their personalities that their interactions would be cringey.I can't wait for the new Dr. Strange now!",

But I will say this - please please please don't spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it yet as it will lose that magic of the unexpected.Definitely my favourite Spider-Man film yet and Peter Parker's arc in this is something to be marvelled (no pun intended).

The scene where we get to meet old friends for the first time in movies history like this made me cry rivers while my heart skiped a beat.This movie have no singel plothole which is rare in todays movie industrie. The performance from Tom Holland is above any actor that has played Spider-Man before him from now on. Tobey came back as a better version of himself and Andrew as a darker and more sad one. I can now see the perfect way to move forward with the Tobey and Andrew Spider-Man movies in a extremely good way. The possibilites after no way home is endless!DC, your move!",

    "reviewBody": "Honestly haven't been this excited for a movie in a long time. Was jumping in my seat quite a lot throughout the film. This is a true love letter to Marvel fans but more specifically Spider-Man fans. The idea of Andrew and Tobey even returning was such an amazing thing to imagine, but seeing it on the big screen was truly incredible. The chemistry between Tom, Andrew and Tobey is on point and really feels \"real\" in a sense. For me personally, Andrew really steals the show which really feels like they gave him a redemption after being let down by the writers in his own movies. Having old villains return for one final showdown is just golden. Willem DaFoe puts on an incredible performance alongside Alfred Molina. Personally Jamie Foxx was my favourite out of the bunch, he really stood out among his fellow cast. Can't wait for Tom's next trilogy and what it might hold. If you had suggested this concept a few years back people would've thought you were crazy. But thankfully Marvel made a dream, become reality!",

    "reviewBody": "Alright, I will join the familiar \"I don't usually write reviews on IMDb but I am gonna make an exception for this one\" club. I sincerely wanted to love this movie, just as any other movie I've watched and I will ever watch. Why? Because leaving the theater disappointed is one of the most unpleasant feelings a film lover could ever experience. It's like being deprived of something you felt was rightfully yours. Anyway...Back to the movie: does it contain everything everyone was expecting from it? Yes. The second half is basically a giant meme composed of all the \"imagine if they did this scene where the three spideys talk about X\" type of comments I have read over and over under the \"No Way Home\" trailers. Is this a problem for me? No, not per se. But it becomes one if this sort of exaggerated fan-service distracts the viewers from the main issue regarding this movie, that is: it is extremely childish. To the point where it becomes unrealistic and, therefore, poorly written. Leaving aside the cringey jokes (that make up a consistent part of the movie, by the way), the entire first half is driven by nonsensical choices made by all the characters, both young and adult ones. And to all you out there arguing that the movie mostly deals with adolescents, keep in mind that there's a huge difference between high school and kindergarten. I won't go into the details of all the problems I have with this movie's screenplay: if you've seen the movie and you're not delusional you'll know what I'm talking about.With Peter and Green Goblin's first fight, the movie takes a completely different turn, instantly becoming darker and more serious, and also way more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, dialogues are still overall amateurish and predictable, but there are way more fight scenes, meaning that the characters don't talk that much. And that's a blessing, because the silent moments are the ones that prevent me from giving this movie an even lower rating: Aunt May's passing is painfully touching and Peter and MJ's encounter after Doctor strange's spell is magical in its drama.To sum things up, this movie really left me thinking about some of the latest Marvel movies' inherent problems:1) Are all Marvel movies destined to have the same tone, regardless of the plot?2) Is the quality of the Marvel movies only determined by the degree to which they satisfy the viewer's expectations, regardless of more technical issues, like screenplay, cinematography and such?To quote this (and the first Spider-Man movie): \"with great power comes great responsibility\". Well, the greatest power of all is intelligence and it should never be forgotten when it comes to writing movies.",

    "reviewBody": "Spider has always been a movie that never quite kept everyone happy as everybody has a certain expectation of their most beloved characters.This movie solves all this by throwing everything spiderman related and created at you in just over 2 hours.The movies bounces up and down in the he first half and starts to take form in the second half. Tom Holland delivers strongly on the emotionally side of things. Itge villains have all been refined and are a lot slicker. Hats off to Willem Dafoe for pulling it out of the bag a second time. Tobey Maguire was always one the weakest of the 3 Spidermen. It shows here. His acting chops don't match Andrew or Tom. For nostalgia reasons and the purposes of the story he fit in well. I always found Andrew Garfield the best of the 3 with the worse movies. Garfield really shines in.this movie and I think he steals every scene. It's a shame the movies he was in were not of a higher calibre..\nIn conclusion this movie is a fun ride that pays a massive service to fans of the movies and comics alike. While it is still light viewing for the most part it is a roller coaster of emotions. Some of the darkest Spiderman scenes filmed take place in this movie.. The plot is a bit messy and clunky. Dr Strange kind of feels out of place in the movie. Understandably the situations could not have taken place without him. Some of the fight scene are not great but this is not where the heart of this movie is. It's a story of Spiderman finally understanding the motto he wears on his sleeve. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. This movie achieves that.",

And seen from the second end credits scene which is basically a trailer of Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness, there will be others that shall break the record of this one.Brace yourselves, because \"things just got out of hand\" !",

    "reviewTitle": "Ambitious, Exhilarating - Lives up to the Hype!",
    "reviewBody": "Having the previous Spider-Man characters in the film was a guaranteed recipe for success. Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire entered the fray perfectly. Garfield stole the show in my opinion, but seeing the chemistry between him and Toby and then both of them with Holland was a childhood dream come true. Despite rumours floating around beforehand of their appearances in the movie, it was still an incredibly surprising moment when they actually appeared on screen. Audible gasps were heard in the cinema and despite knowing with some surety that it would happen, it was still a pleasant surprise.The amount of screen time Maguire and Garfield got felt just right. They were present enough to make an impact and provide us with the smiles, laughter and nostalgic familiarity that we wanted so much, but not so much as to overshadow Holland and to make us forget the fact that this in fact is a film where he is the main character.It was brilliant how the film was able to poke fun at itself by way of the three different Peter Parkers. They joked about how Maguire was the only one who didn't need a contraption to shoot webs and this semi-breaking of the fourth wall made the audience feel respected in that everyone was aware of the contradictions in the different visions of Spider-Man throughout the decades and how these differences were all together in the same room, united. Maguire, Garfield and Holland worked excellently together, and despite Maguire looking visibly older he was able to bring a presence of experience alongside his traditional goofiness to the table. Any scene with more than one Spider-Man was a pleasure to watch.Another aspect of the film that I was happy about was the notable step away from relying on the MCU. While the connection to the MCU can be a huge benefit to a superhero film, it can also act as somewhat of a crutch for weaker characters who cant stand on their own. In No Way Home, while the link to the wider MCU is both established and used via the help of Dr Strange (in fact he is an integral part), he feels like only a section of the movie and not part of its main storyline. At each step he is kept realistically occupied so that the problems throughout the film can be addressed without him and the wider MCU. This finally addressed what I found problematic in the earlier Tom Holland films and allowed the Spider-Man franchise to stand on its own eight feet for once.Although Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield were more or less supporting characters in this film, its clear that the script writers gave them enough respect and us enough fan-service to ensure that their characters developed beyond their original stories all these years later. For Garfield's Spider-Man this comes at a heart-stopping moment when during the final battle MJ falls off the scaffolding towards an untimely end. Tom Holland's Spider-Man makes a dash for her in an eerie echo to how Garfield's Spider-Man dove right after Gwen Stacey in his film. Sadly for Garfield's Spider-Man however, he was too late and he was unable to save Gwen as she hit the ground and died and it seems for a moment that this fate will again play out as Holland's Spider-Man is obstructed from saving MJ by the Green Goblin's glider. It is at this very moment that Garfield's Spider-Man swoops in with fire in his eyes to save MJ and do what he never did in his own universe. Prevent Spider-Man's love interest from death. We see his emotion flare up and with tears in his eyes we see him realise what he has accomplished. No doubt this provides his character with some much needed healing, and us with some much needed closure.For Maguire it came in the form of matured, heartfelt mentoring. Despite the closeness between Tony Stark and Peter Parker in this universe, the only one who could really understand how Holland's Peter Parker felt after the tragic death of his Aunt May was another Spider-Man who had also felt loss. Although Garfield's Spider-Man had felt this loss too, Maguire was able to provide a matured, healed and calming presence to Holland's Peter Parker to help him navigate his grief. Boy did he need it. Holland's Spider-Man was on a rampage during the final fight with the Green Goblin and for the first time we saw a brutal side of him that enjoyed causing pain to his enemies. It was unexpected but a reminder that without the guidance of those older and wiser than us, we are susceptible to fall into mistakes that can ruin us. Maguire was able to guide Holland away from such a path and towards one of compassion and mercy, emphasised by the theme of \"cure, not kill\", which meant that villains would be pacified and returned to their original, pre-supervillain state instead of killed. This guidance was profound and enabled Holland's Peter Parker to overcome his anger and transcend it, allowing him to become the hero his suit deserved. Maguire really shined here and we understood the effect that time, loss and sacrifice can have on a man.Ultimately, Tom Holland's Spider-Man was mentored at the time he needed it most, by the very people (essentially matured versions of himself) who were best suited to do so. He was able to realise that there were other who knew how he felt and who could show him a better path.I found it interesting to note that a criticism of Tom Holland's Peter Parker initially was that we didn't get to see him \"become\" Spider-Man. From the first time we saw him, he already was the friendly neighbourhood hero we are familiar with. We didn't even see him experience loss with the traditional death of his Uncle Ben sparking a quest of grief and self-discovery leading to his maturity into the Spider-Man we know. In 'No Way Home' however, we see this moment of loss occur when we least expect it. Holland's Peter Parker loses his Aunt May after the apartment they are in is attacked by the Green Goblin. Before she passes she is able to convey the famous words of wisdom which are destined to ring in the ears of every webbed superhero until the end of time, \"With great power comes great responsibility\". Seeing Holland's Peter Parker experience this loss in the 3rd film instead of the first was a twist I didn't see coming, but it showed that the script writers didn't forget about the original formula. While they didn't follow it to a tee, they still incorporated it into their vision. I can respect that. It also felt as though even though it happened in his third film, it may be a hint towards a new beginning for his character, one where he is self confident and sure in his identity and intentions.In order to save the world he knows from collapsing in on itself, Holland's Peter Parker has to make an agonising choice. The only way to fix things properly is to erase everyone's memory about him, to the extent that no one would know that he is Spider-Man anymore. His best friend and love interest, MJ would be living their lives as if they never knew who he was. Seeing that this is the only way forward, Holland's Spider-Man take the leap of faith and asks Dr Strange to make it happen. Its heart-breaking results are seen towards the end of the film when Holland goes to meet an MJ with no memories of Peter Parker as Spider-Man and tell her everything so they can get back together again. Noticing some minor injuries MJ sustained during the final battle previously, Parker pauses for introspection before deciding not to open up to her. By making such a painful decision, MJ is saved from entering a world where she is inherently at danger due to associating with Spider-Man at all. In previous films, Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Man have been able to make this decision consensually with their respective love interests, but this time it is only Peter Parker who knows. As he sees MJ and his former best friend Ned enjoy their time together as friends, he realises that he does better service to them by keeping them safe even if it means he loses their love and companionship. This is the ultimate sacrifice he makes for them, choosing to bear this pain alone as he allows them to live blissfully unaware of their previous life.Holland's Peter Parker was able to embody perfectly the meaning of the words echoing in his mind and the mind of all Spider-Men in all universes, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".This movie started off as the previous films did. It had a tint of childishness to it which meant I couldn't really take it seriously compared to previous entries in the franchise. But I realise now that 'No Way Home' served as a coming of age moment for Holland's Peter Parker. He has been able to shed his previous life and relationships through grief, loss and sacrifice while learning and being mentored by some of the greatest mentors any Peter Parker could have. I truly feel like his Spider-Man has matured through to the point that he is ready to stand on his own and give us the Peter Parker we have always expected. He delivered in this film and we saw him grow and mature to where his identity is set in stone. Although people may have historically taken issue with Holland's Spider-Man in that there was no origin story like the previous Spider-Man heroes had, in hindsight it feels like the entire trilogy of Holland films have led up to this moment and I am able to fully appreciate that now.The events of the film also signal a break away from the main MCU characters, as everyone would have lost their memory of Peter Parker and potentially have no idea how to contact a web-slinging superhero in New York. I don't expect his inclusion in wider, high profile MCU films for a while, and considering the direction this film has taken, I am OK with that. Tied in to the fact that his Aunt May has died and Parker has now finished High School and now going to College, separating from his old friends and life seems like a logical step forward.I look forward to his further adventures.",

I think the script writer and director just need to make a story that can bring so many villains and other Spider-men to join into this movie. This is kinda good,but how to make them join and Dr Strange influences in this are really forced and kinda stupid actually. How can Dr Strange can be fooled so easily by Spider-man in his territory. Yeah I know..this is just a teenager movie. Whatever...everything looked so weird..the Spider-man, May, Ned, MJ...they are not connected emotionally.

Let me tell ya something, they're in the movie and they have a 25-30 minute screen time, the interaction and chemistry between the three Spider-Men are absolutely incredible and funny, the movie honour Tobey and Andrew legacy and their appearance makes Tom Holland Spider-Man matured, all of three have the same proportion of spotlight so all Spider-Men are treated equally, the CGI being more advanced now showcase Tobey's skill as Spider-Man better.",

    "reviewTitle": "Epic Movie a must watch for marvel lovers!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "I managed to get tickets to watch the movie in the uk the day it came out and it was packed with action, sadness and plenty of shocking moments. Personally i still think andrew garfield is the best spider man, and the fact that he made an appearance was awesome i really loved that they also bring back all the old villains and of course the og tobey maguire, i don't see how they can make another spider man movie after this one because this acts as a good way to end the spider man movie collection. The ending deeply saddened me as well as the death of aunt may (RIP 😞)The only thing i disliked about the movie is some characters made bad unrealistic decisions which made them look stupid but i guess these decisions must be made in order to have the action so it cancels out. The post credit scenes were interesting but i'm a bit annoyed that one of them was basically a trailer for a future movie which ruined the experience but the first scene was a bit odd at first, but when i understood that the symbiote was in tom hollands universe i was shocked as this could be the start of another movie. It is amazing how we get to see these actors grow up, it will be interesting to see if spider-man is still going on in 10yrs and how will the actors look like compared to their current state.",

Very Emotiona like in the old spider man movies and it looks like the story goes back to the beginning of spider man 2002. To be honest, I don't like Spider man in the Avangers Team. Spider man deserves an own movie without too much science fiction and too much magic of avangers. This one was an exception and a masterpiece as well.

    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.",

    "reviewTitle": "An Epic Film That Really Delivers",
    "reviewBody": "Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character\nTom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters\nZendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story\nThe story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script\nMCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style\nThe film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall\nOverall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"Rating: A.",

    "reviewBody": "I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as powerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well developed evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Holland's era due to a lackluster couple of previous solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are really strong, the script covers its plotholes & weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending looks like a true ending to Holland's Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise. I did not buy any trailer nor stinger from this movie and I was blown away. Best Spider-Man movie tied with 'Spider-Verse' and Sam Raimi's 2004 sequel. See it now!",

But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff.",

    "reviewBody": "I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough.",

    "reviewTitle": "Your Senses Gonna Blow So Hard!",
    "reviewBody": "It's...I'm still trying to realize what I've seen, but I've seen things I didn't think I'd ever see on the big screen! We all know that spoilers have been on the internet for more than a year, but apart from the things we thought, there are a lot of other things and of course I won't spoil anything, but...the film pulls very thin string from our emotions and it worked perfectly!The story is solid, it's not just fan service, which was one of my fears, there are explanations for everything. Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film. Strange's role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series again...I don't even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the edge of your seat.The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in comicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and again.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In some places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There are comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much darker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and that's tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some smaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding! (Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchino's music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some darker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more tangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads straight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!",

    "reviewBody": "NO SPOILERS!Everything that has been previously built has led up to this and tens to hundreds of theories have been speculated and lo and behold, this is so much better than Endgame. Though most of the theories aren't true, but it's impressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spider-Man: No Way Home Delivers Epic Marvel Action And Plenty Of Surprises",
    "reviewBody": "Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\".Taking place where \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.",

While in Homecoming and Far From Home, Peter Parker's character felt quite childish, this film would show the transititon of a more grown-up Peter Parker, and Tom Holland did really well for making it happen. Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot. So don't be spoiled if you wanted to have fun watching Spider-Man No Way Home, because the surprise elements are the key of this film.",

The movie is filled with fan service and throwbacks to previous movies -- so I highly recommend that you see all the previous movies. It will enhance the experience.And not only that, the movie has its own story and identity. What Tom Holland's Spiderman goes through - it was very satisfying to watch.The ending is the best ending in the MCU trilogy, and probably one of my favorite spiderman endings.The movie took some risks and things will never be the same for spiderman after this movie - and I am excited to see what will come next.There are some moments where the scene / conversation goes too long that it gets kinda frustrating / annoying. The action is nice but not as good as stuff like shang-chi.These are just small nit-picks, the overall experience is still great.*There are Two End-credit scenes, and Both are fantastic.**Willem Dafoe more like Willem DaGoat.",

    "reviewBody": "One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.",

    "reviewBody": "As I've said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the \"amazing Spider-Man\" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.",

Spider-man's identity is revealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way Home is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises. If you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope of the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and applauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which adds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves the way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is finally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best not to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You won't be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest Spider-Man movie I've ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen as well. Overall a great film and I can't wait to see where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes next.",

    "reviewTitle": "\"The multiverse is a concept of which we know frighteningly little.\"",
    "reviewBody": "Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.",

    "reviewTitle": "Peter Parker, giving it all his heart, and everything else...",
    "reviewBody": "The first thing that comes to my mind is how prodigious the script writing is, masterfully layered, epic on countless levels, and moreover deeply emotional... Peter Parker faces extremely complex choices, going through a big number of ordeals, putting his heart in the front-line all the time... And yeah, it shows you how constantly trying to right every wrong is more than a monumental task for one sole being. Luckily, he has several wonderful supports -all along this chaotic journey- who give their heart to fill these roles in the best possible way, and that, in itself is very touching... But in this movie, the stakes resonate on a wide number of aspects, it isn't at all just about \"good & bad\", it's a human story (which makes it the magnificent movie that it is) and the hero at the core of all these meanders has to fully embrace his responsibilities... A true hero's journey sadly is punctuated with tragic steps that tell you how right is what you're doing. And indeed, in the end, it all takes you back to this existential question, and its heartbreaking answer : \"What did it cost ?\" ... \"Everything.\"Now on a lighter note, the easter eggs and winks to the audience, there are tons of thems and each one of them smoothly flows in the most logical & delightful way with the story (the audience cheers and applaudes on multiple occasions) ; either rewarding you in the process or planting seeds for obvious future storylines to come and develop further down the line... And again, most of these elements have an emotional impact to them, or lead you to some intriguing (and interesting) questions...\nWhat's for sure is that you go through a lot heart-grabbing moments, all along this movie... It has a lot of epicness to it, of course ; but what leaves you in awe is that the emotional aspect of all these scenes is what really leaves you blissfully happy. And when the movie's over one and for all, you can already enjoy all these clever (but numerous) little seeds, eventually evolving in new mind-blowing directions in the future...How not to applaude this movie, from its great build-up (every character has at least one thing that makes you attached to him and his eventual outcome), the way it's navigates so well between epic sequences and dialogues that add ever more to the moving aspect of it all ; leading you to this legendary last third of the movie, in which anything is a real blast (PS : the two end credits are really worth waiting for).I'll finish with the quality of the whole piece, from the nicely mastered staging, the pace (2h30 that flow like 1h), the obvious dedication (and passion) that's infused in every scene by the actors (but also by all the team behind the movie ; you can feel it all along) and the dialogs that are a delight... The special effects are once again amazing... The score offers several memorable pieces...\nNot just one of the greatest superhero movies ever, but an unforgettable movie, period.",

MCU phase 4 has had a very very rough start with financial flops Black Widow that needing $700m to break even due to the 4 times being pushed back and costing $100m a pop only to bring in just over $500m, on top of SJ suing for $50m, Shang Chi needing $500m to break even only to fall short by $100m end of its run and then Eternals a critical and financial bomb along with China not being interested and most of Europe not being bothered. MCU Phase 4 really needed something big and I have to say Spider-Man No Way Home has done that. Nice surprises and a great finale, easily the best spider-man movie in Hollands lack luster trilogy.",

Strange's spell goes south and Spider-Man has to face some known faces.The first half of the movie is intriguing and entertaining but there is too much to digest in the second half. Some things feel rushed, but they do a fairly good job.Nostalgia and fan service are big parts of this movie. Spider-Man fans will enjoy it, even though some of the callbacks are uncalled for.The action is great and the visual effects are better than the previous Spider-Man films starring Tom Holland.Peter's character arc is great. He develops and learns a lot even with the multiverse stuff going on around him.The humour is inconsistent and sometimes out of place. Spider-Man and his friends are immature and not very intelligent. They do at times succeed in making the audience laugh, but there are many unnecessary jokes sprinkled throughout the movie.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is overall an entertaining movie with few flaws. If you like the previous Spider-Man movies you will most likely like this one too. It's a massive, entertaining and sentimental movie with great action and acting.",

The writing is ridiculously good. Feels like they brought the best bits of everything Spider-Man related from comics and media all in one movie. The stakes are as high and real as they´ve ever beenTom Holland delivers his finest, most meaningful and moving performance as Peter Parker.No Way Home understands the Spider-Man character like no Spider-Man film before it.Spider-Man No Way Home ushers in a whole new era for the MCU. They have reached another level, risen above their previous benchmarks and there is no going back. Spectacular. Amazing!This film is a masterpiece like i have rarely seen before.I want to end this little review with just saying thank you.Thank you Marvel, thank you Sony. Thank you John Watts and thank you Kevin Feige. You all listened to the fans and delivered us a movie for the history books, that will be cheered about for decades to come.",

    "reviewBody": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is undoubtedly the most hyped movie of this year and it's ambitions are quite high. Now Spider-Man fans will love this movie, it is what I call a \"fan service\" film which is the reason why it may fall flat for regular movie goers.The main problem of this movie is the fact that you can guess most things that'll happen, now this may not be a bad thing but when the most hyped up film of the year has a less than amazing and guessable plot you feel kind of disappointed. Also Spider-Man couldn't be any stupider, I won't spoil anything but all of his decisions are guessable and extremely dumb for the most part. Now let's talk a little bit about the goods because this movie isn't bad, the main highlight is the visuals, the film has inception-like scenes and it's a feast for the eyes. The actors also do their job and seeing Willem Dafoe without his usual green goblin mask is a great addition, his villainous face was wasted under that piece of metal.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fine movie overall, Spider-Man fans will probably love it but I would still recommend it to regular movie goers or people wanting to know what the hype is about, 7/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Forced at times, but overall very satisfying and fulfilling.",
    "reviewBody": "SPOILER FREE.This is an extremely difficult movie to talk about without going into any spoilers. But I'll give it a shot.Having been excited and extremely hyped up for this movie (just like the rest of the world) for the last 7 months, I went in with extraordinarily high expectations. What I can say is, happily, those expectations were met and even sometimes surpassed. More or less everything you'd expect from a good spider-man movie is here, and then some. As I said, this is tough to talk about without mentioning plot.Given that If i could mention spoilers here, I could sit and gush about this movie for hours and hours, about all of the ways it is great. But that isn't possible. So instead, I'll let my previous words suffice for the praise I give this movie, and I will move on to what I didn't like, as it is somewhat easier to be extremely vague and subtle when criticising the movie. Whereas praising is nigh impossible at the moment. So, the plot.The plot seems, to me, to be spread extremely thin in places. The reasons given for the things happening in the story are pretty darn weak at times. There are contrivances, and they do sort of stick out. But only for a brief time, because the next scene could have you grinning from ear to ear having forgotten all about said contrivance. However, this doesn't change the fact that some of this feels messy. The movie comes across as being EXTREMELY desperate to get to a certain point, and it suffers for it slightly. Given the run time, the fact we're still rushing here is disappointing.I suppose It's praise worthy that the movie is able to make you roll your eyes in one scene, at a particularly forced moment or plot point, and in the next moment, have you giggling with a child-like glee, seeing things you only ever wished you'd see in the past. And that truly is the strength of this movie. Without spoiling, the magic here is what has been pulled off. 'Pulled off' being an important coupling of words. Because that is essentially what has happened here, to the credit of everybody involved. It has been pulled off, and is ALMOST the best superhero movie ever made to date now. Certainly the best Marvel effort, second only to Iron Man 1 possibly.I can't really say much more, as much as I really want to just rip this one apart and spill the insides out for you all, It'd be wrong.Just go see this one guys. Trust me. 9/10.",

Spider-Man 2 used to be the pinnacle of Spider-Man films, but this matches it although with more grandeur than you could ever imagine.This movie is an experience. Seriously, the whole cinema was clapping, cheering, crying together as one. This has awoken the child in me and I cried numerous times myself - I rarely cry at films. Was this fan service? Absolutely. But it was done perfectly.This film is a masterpiece, it'll go down as the greatest marvel film of all time and I doubt it can be surpassed. The actors were perfect, their performances were phenomenal. I wasn't a great fan of Homecoming or Far from home, but Tom Holland was exceptional in this as was everyone else.Go and see it, you won't be disappointed. Now, if you'll excuse me I am going to pre-order the 4K Blu-Ray so I can watch this again and again.",

Sure the special effects are fantastic, character designs are cool and the score is great, but everything else just wasn't.

But they really do need to lose this director (Jon Watts) for the next round of films. His jokes are a bit too much and not in a good way like Taika Wataiti. Greatest spiderman film hands down.",

    "reviewBody": "With great power comes great responsibility, Marvel, Disney and Sony have delivered quite possibly the pinnacle of superhero movies simply by following this mantra, pooling all of their vast resources into one, working together without ego proving that the power of 3 can truly be a wonderful thing....\nI loved this movie, for the first time since the (covid) blip my local picture house was sold out, not only were there no empty seats but there were no dry eyes and no unsatisfied customers either.Not since Cap lifted Mjiolnir and assembled the Avengers have I heard a room erupt with such rousing aplomb, which was only enhanced by the gasps, shocks and tears that sped the plot along from the opening scene to the closing shot.... quite simply a 'perfect' movie, not in the Schindlers List or Shawshank way but the way Back to the Future, Ghostbusters or Die Hard are 'perfect', they tick every box, they stand the test of time, they are simply classics and I have no doubt that No Way Home will be a welcome addition to the club. See it for yourselves, you will not be disspointed.",

We maybe never see this type of movie ever again. Tom Holland performance is same as Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man. TOP TOP TOP LEVEL Performance. Zendaya, Jacob, Marissa Tomei & Jon Favreau having great performance of their life. Tons of easter egg and the villains just WOW. Willem Defoe played green goblin SUPERBLY as expected. Alfred Mollina as Doc Oc is Awesome and fun to watch him. Jamie Fox is funny even funnier than \"the first time we saw him\" . The fight scene is awesome, the effect is almost Perfect. Benedict Cumberbatch have very MAJOR role is the movie. Yes it is tied to Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness. There is two Credits Scene, Just stay until it Appear.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply Epic",
    "reviewBody": "I had a lot of expectations going into this movie, I read some non spoiler reviews of it and some of them said it's the best movie in the MCU. In my opinion it's not, but it's very very close, IMHO Thor Ragnorok is virtually perfect. This does come very very close, in terms of sheer scale it's on par with Civil War, some proper geek out moments. I won't spoil them, because it's totally worth going to see it at the cinema, my biggest nerd moment seemed to be a bit different to other peoples judging off the gasps and applause from the audience. Let's just say I like Netflix shows.In terms of its 'epicness' I think it falls a little short of Endgame although my two daughters who I went with thought it was on a grander scale to endgame and infinity war. I will leave that to your own judgement.We all now know that Tom Holland has signed on again the put the spandex suit on, but this would have been a great ending to Tom's tenure as Spidermsn, many people are crying out for a more diverse lead character, and they actually comment upon this in the movie.It was a long film so stock up on the snacks and drinks, but to be fair at no point did I think the film was dragging its feet to fill the time.In summary a damned good film, up there with the best the MCU has to offer but not in my opinion the GOAT.First post credit scene was amazing, and it still bemuses me after so many MCU Films the amount of people who get up and leave, they don't even put the lights on anymore like they used to. I was rather confused by the second end credits scene, it wasn't a scene it was a trailer for the next Doctor Strange movie .Now this is the bit of my review that will look very strange if after many years IMDB is still going strong (thanks Amazon) - it was very difficult sitting with a mask on for the whole length of the film, I am also pleased to announce that 99% of the audience complied with the order to 'mask up'\nThere was a couple of eejits who were not wearing a mask, and they were not challenged by the staff either (they were not showing exempt notices). To give the @odeonsilverlink some credit, most of the people on the 'shop floor' were either at school or college/uni so I wouldn't really expect them to challenge someone for not wearing a mask. It shouldn't have to rely on other audience members to say anything, this should be done by the management or supervisorsWell I managed to create a spoiler free review, I'm happy with myself.",

It could be a 7 or 8 for people who didn't grow up with Spider-Man. The actings are amazing especially Tom Holland, the story is really well written, and the soundtrack is chef's kiss. Of course there are some flaws and plot-holes, which is why I didn't give 10/10.Without spoiling anything, please do yourself a favor and go watch the original Spider-Man trilogy and the two Amazing Spider-Man reboot before watching this movie.",

Overall it was fine, a few surprises, but nothing more. If you have followed the leaks and everything, well nothing will really surprise you. The conclusion of the movie is by far the best thing in the whole movie. It makes Peter independent, and we might actually get to see the real Spider-Man in the future now.",

It manages this while balancing the drama, the action and the trademark Spider-Man comedy perfectly.You could argue that this is the most serious of the 8 Spider-Man movies with plenty of moments to pull on your heart strings. There are also crowd pleasing moments galore. No spoilers, but there are some awesome surprises thrown in.It was never going to reach the heights of Infinity War or Endgame, but it could well be the best Spidey movie ever!

It makes you laugh, cry, gasp & cheer whilst having much more depth and gravitas than I initially thought. The villains are great (some better than others) but Willem Dafoe's performance as Green Goblin steals the show and still sits with me now. This is hands down Tom Holland's best performance as Spider-Man/Peter Parker.My only gripe is the film tonally in the middle act, as it loses its way a tiny bit and some of the jokes feel unnecessary but the first & final act are a masterpiece.I can't wait to rewatch it.",

He experienced an abundance of emotions, all while learning how to control them and be the best version of himself that he can be, because you know, \"with great power comes great responsibility\".The ensemble cast work together like no other, the humour is beyond incredible and the visuals are absolutely stunning, backed up with an amazing score also.There's not much that can be said without spoiling the movie however, this movie is not one to be missed.An AMAZING conclusion to the homecoming trilogy.

    "reviewTitle": "An Unstoppable Force of Awesomeness! All Hail The New King!",
    "reviewBody": "I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional \"team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho.\" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work \"the other side of the fence\" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.",

But when we talk about being disappointed because of the high expectations we had from a movie i can assure you that no matter how high your hopes may be pinned on this film you will not get be disappointed at any cost.Joss whedon has put together some of the most talented actors out there into a very sensibly written script(Funny, thrilling lacking even a single dull moment) to create what i would like to refer to as a phenomenal film which till now was considered only a rare possibility.I will say one thing though, while the film was still in development i was bit weary of Tom Middleton handling all these superheroes by himself, but to my amazement he was a total 'bad***',intense and menacing a supervillan to simplify what I'm trying to say! hats off to you mate!!!

The special effects by far are the best for any Marvel movie. The Hulk Looks so much more real. By the way The Hulk made the movie even better. Also, DO NOT SEE THE AVENGERS IN 3D! See the film because you will not be disappointed even if you are not that interested into superhero movies. It has a lot of humor and love, so again SEE IT!",

This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!",

Hell, who am I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who would've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced. Truthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the world later.

    "reviewTitle": "Nothing Short of Amazing",
    "reviewBody": "I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story. You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like \"Wow this guy/chick is a badass\" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought \"Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity\". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success. And in this day and age of superhero movies and movies in general that is very hard to do. Cheers Joss Whedon!",

And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors' performances in \"Marvel's The Avengers\" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring. Ten out of ten.",

    "reviewBody": "The Avengers has been in development for years. Ever since I saw Iron Man for the first time and saw that after credits sequence for the first time, I knew something huge was about to happen. Now four years later, it is finally happening. Marvel brought together Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to form the Avengers. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon who is known to be a legend with TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Angel, and Dollhouse. Now this has been my most anticipated film of 2012 for a long time and every trailer has gotten me more pumped than the previous one. Well, I finally saw it at the New York IMAX 3D fan screening (one of 10 that was being held across the country) and I have to say that I may make some bold statements in this review, but I fully believe in them. The Avengers is gonna be a really tough film to beat for not just the best superhero film of the year, but the best film of the year in general.I really have nothing but praise for The Avengers. It's everything that I wanted it to be and more. After four years of following Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, Marvel and Joss Whedon brought everything full circle for whats sure to be a critical and financial success. It's funny, emotional, a visual spectacle, and just everything that makes a perfect superhero movie. I cannot wait to go see it again on May 4th.Overall, I give The Avengers an A+",

    "reviewBody": "LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little \"Justice League\" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening. I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it. Thrice. 10/10 Stars.",

    "reviewTitle": "Beyond Excellent. Avengers Hits At The Highest Level!",
    "reviewBody": "Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by \"Marvelizing\" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year. This movie is just that good",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers Assemble",
    "reviewBody": "I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics. A subtle phrasing full of a meaning that only comic books fans will understand.",

Spider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldn't be beat. But then Iron Man showed up 6 years later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an Avengers film. Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it. Me I could watch Iron Man Thor Hulk etc fight evil a million times over and it would never get old because Stan the man Lee has created something special with each character in Marvel and those qualities have finally come out in this film",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "I had the extreme pleasure of seeing this movie last weekend at a Facebook fan screening in Hollywood. I waited in line for 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of Writer/Director Josh Whedon, stars Chris \"Thor\" Hemsworh Tom \"Loki\" Hiddleston, Clark \"Agent Phil Coulson\", Cobie \"Maria Hill Smulders and Producer Kevin Feige and let me just say ... I would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again...The Avengers in one word was \"AMAZING\" Josh Whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic universe !!! The action, humor and story were spot on. The action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen., everything you love about the comics is there and then some. It was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans, for the fans... It dozen't matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons, everyone will find something to like about this movie. Just be prepared for a roller-coaster ride and a a great time at the movies!I have to say when I first heard Mr. Whedon was attached to direct, as a Buffy and Angel fan I was excited., But he succeeded all my expectations and then some. Anyone says you just can't write a good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the Josh Whedon school of screen-writing... Mr. Whedon did a phenomenal job of handling each character providing every actor (big and small) their time to shine.The Avengers have assembled... and I can't wait to see them again an again !!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Beyond brilliant and beyond awesome, this perfectly plotted and skilfully assembled blend of wit, humour and jaw-dropping action is undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever",
    "reviewBody": "A colossal wave of fevered anticipation has preceded the arrival of 'Marvel's The Avengers', the culmination of five incredibly successful standalone films over the last four years. Not only has helmer Joss Whedon not cracked under the immense hype, he has amazingly managed to surpass the loftiest expectations with a movie that towers over the rest that have come before it, combining jaw-dropping action, tongue-in-cheek humour and poignant drama into a dazzling piece of summer blockbuster entertainment. Proving that the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts, Wheedon has distilled the best elements of each of the preceding movies into this assembly of Marvel superheroes- Iron Man is wiry and snarky as ever; Thor is just as Godly in his might but Human-ly in his compassion; and Captain America is still appealingly old-school. The Hulk, or Bruce Banner in his human form, is quite something else altogether though (being the only character to have a change of actor from the aforementioned films) and very much all the better for it- but we'll save our gushing for later.It shouldn't come as any surprise that the one movie which 'Avengers' is most intimately associated with is 'Thor', given that both share the same villain- Thor's adopted brother and fellow Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston)- and that Wheedon did shoot the post-credits scene with Loki and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Opening with a recurring character from that movie, Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) is now assisting with experiments on the Tessaract which has quite unexpectedly displayed a life of its own.Turns out that the fallen Loki has been drafted by an alien race to lead its invasion of Earth, using the same Tessaract as a portal to cross over from their universe to ours- and his arrival not only leads to the decimation of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, but also the takeover of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Selvig to do his bidding. With the fate of the world in the balance, Fury activates his 'Avengers' initiative to gather the aforementioned superheroes with two others- Black Widow and Hawkeye. Even from the outset, it's clear that there is organic spontaneity in Wheedon's storytelling, as he fluently weaves together the recruiting exercise by Fury and his trusted agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the participating superheroes. The best he saves for last, so even though Thor only first appears half an hour into the movie, his is a spectacular entrance befitting of that for a God, crossing paths with Iron Man for a thunderous one-on-one clash in the middle of the woods.True to the spirit of the books, the assembly of these superheroes begins on a fractious note- chiefly due to Stark's distrust of Fury and disdain for the star-and-stripes-outfitted Captain America. Instead, Stark teams up with the only person he deigns as his intellectual equal- Bruce Banner- to locate the Tessaract and uncover what dirty secrets Fury has been keeping from the rest of them. The answer to the latter isn't all too unexpected, but kudos to Wheedon for tying this little detail nicely with what happened in 'Thor'. It will take something colossal to jolt them out of their self- centredness- and believe us when we say that game-changer is certainly massive, counting for the first of two action setpieces in the movie that will undoubtedly qualify amongst some of the most spectacularly thrilling stuff you'll see on the big screen this year. And just when you think it couldn't get any better, Wheedon tops it with an even grander and absolutely breathtaking climax set in the heart of New York City.The reason why the finale works so brilliantly is the same as why the entire movie is that awesome- Wheedon loves and respects each and every superhero character just as much. Wheedon gets the action pitch-perfect through reinforcing the individual powers of each one of the superheroes before uniting their strengths to form an even mightier coalition. It is nothing less than pure ecstasy when they join forces as a team, and you'll find it difficult to resist getting up from your seat and cheering for them at various points throughout the remarkable finish.This review however won't be complete without a special shout-out for the Hulk, many fans of whom have been disappointed by both the Lee Ang and the later Louis Leterrier iteration of it. Here, Wheedon has finally gotten it right, blending both the character's brains and brawn to crowdpleasing effect- even more so through some clever plotting that ensures Banner's eventual transformation from man to beast is as rewarding as it should be. Indeed, there's really no reason why you shouldn't be running out and catching this the first instance it opens. Calling it the perfect summer blockbuster is probably not enough to do justice to just how brilliant it is, and well deserving of every superlative we have lavished on it thus far. Filled with wit, humour and incredible action, it ranks as one of the most- if not the most- entertaining and exhilarating experiences you'll have at the movies this year.",

    "reviewTitle": "They balanced everything masterfully. As Good As It Gets!!!",
    "reviewBody": "If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream \"BADASS!\" and mean it.I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers assembled flawlessly",
    "reviewBody": "I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as \"assembled\" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to \"hulk out\". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+",

    "reviewTitle": "A Flat out Exceptional Movie Event. (Best Villain in Years!)",
    "reviewBody": "I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",

HOWEVER, I will state the two things that I have a minor \"PROBLEM\" with and should be the only \"COMPLAINTS\" about this movie. 1. Joss Whedon said that he CUT the original movie down from 3 HOURS down to 2 hours and 15 minutes, this is something you will definitely notice if you pay enough attention. This leaves room for some \"out of place\" scenes and some fully unexplained situations, but I am guessing it was the studio's decision to do this so don't blame Joss because he did a great job with this enormous task. 2. The reason why this film might gain LESS critical ACCLAMATION then dark knight rises, or ANY OTHER comic book movie, is because of the huge load of Characters that this movie has to balance. I am not saying they are not handled perfectly, BUT it is still much different then a movie with ONE central HERO. All of these main heroes have had their OWN movies, you will need to remember this in order to properly weigh how Joss Whedon handled all of them together. Overall, I think almost anybody will thoroughly enjoy this movie, whether you just like action movies or whether you sit around waiting for new Avengers news to come out. I am a big Marvel fan and I was very speculative about this movie on whether it would be a worthy representation of the Avengers and it completely delivers. Support this movie so that we can have more and more like it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Movie and Easily the New King of the Genre",
    "reviewBody": "Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then you'll define Avengers as great. It's a unified step up and I didn't think that possible. What's also amazing is that I think this movie works without having seen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didn't care about the other movies. The depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What they've done is transcend any other of this genre's films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again, easily the new king of the genre.",

I love the way they bring the team together.This movie is Black Widow's. She's the best written character and has the best scenes.My issue with the movie is how safe it gets. After such a great setup the movie goes flat and goes into safe blockbuster happy meal territory. Explosions and giant aliens and no one seems to get killed.Same issues with HULK. Great setup, Mark does a great job of playing Bruce Banner. Outside of the first five seconds of the transformation scene we get lame looking CGI Hulk. That moves with the reality of a 50's Warner Bros cartoon! I wanted to see Thor and Captain America and Iron Man really kick some major hind in this movie.They don't! A good movie yet the worst of the Marvel produced films! Once was enough.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers - one of the best superhero film so far!",
    "reviewBody": "Believe me when I say that 'The Avengers' was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.The music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.If you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect! 'Over and Out.' 25 April 2012",

    "reviewTitle": "Definitely A Masterpiece by Joss Whedon",
    "reviewBody": "This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel\") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: \"What's this, Shakespeare in the park?\" and \"Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?\" Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - \"you must have been doing a lot of yoga\" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isn't about whether you're going to catch \"The Avengers\"; it's how many times you will want to see it.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Marvel-ous experience",
    "reviewBody": "The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. 4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it. 5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters. Your first glimpse of this movie just HAS to be on the big screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "It gets everything right! What other movies will be measured to in the years that follow.",
    "reviewBody": "Marvel's Avengers is everything a movie should be, and more. It goes without saying that it's the best film of the year to date. There's a serious subtext to the story and great characterization throughout but its focus is on the amazing. As an adventure film, it really has no parallel. When a movie reinvents a popular genre, it speaks volumes. This movie does just that and accomplishes what they've promised us since the first Iron Man movie... giving us that \"bigger universe\" in all its glory. The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting coupled with the writing. Meaning that every character has the perfect dialogue and every quality actor inhabits the hero they portray perfectly. Downey has Stark down cold but we knew that already. He's just given the right stage to shine here. Evans finds his pathos and his chops in this film as Steve Rogers. The Boy Scout all-American has an edge this time around. Hemsworth's Thor has understandable rationale for joining and doing what he does throughout the movie. His inner turmoil and guilt is exquisite. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the acting chops to hang with any movie villain EVER and he's perfect because this is no one dimensional character and his motivation and progression since the Thor film is seen and felt. Samuel L Jackson actually has something to do in this movie... PRAISE BE! Jeremy Renner is a nice addition and even with all the big guns chewing up every scene, he shines. Movie goers will want to see more of his character in the future guaranteed. Scarlett Johansson adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the complex yet sexy female lead and a match for any male on screen. Would you expect any less from a Joss Whedon film? The interaction, conflict/turmoil and the relationships all work well and is definitely one of the highlights of the entire movie itself.Add some of the best kick-butt action sequences that I've ever seen and Avengers is what other movies will be measured to in the years that follow.",

    "reviewBody": "I just saw the movie. I have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now, and a film like this should have been my wet dream. Instead what I saw was a hollow, empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book: an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite (or I should say: thanks to) all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in. The fantasy, the wit, the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids, were completely absent in this studio behemoth. I will admit that the recreation of such magic was a difficult task, probably doomed from the beginning: but this thing is completely lacking brain, or direction, or any meaning at all. The script is a total and utter disaster, full of bore and incredibly shallow, and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves. I will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent Banner/Hulk: it took only three attempts to the Hollywood writers - and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted. Movies like \"Avengers\" are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents, which in this case would be Mr. Mainstream Comics and Mrs. Movie Industry. This leaves them with basically no audience: they are too much gruesome and boring for kids, too much childish for youngsters, while for the adults - at least for those the grown-up ones - there are just too many capes. The same stories, printed on comic pages, still resonate in popular culture after decades: but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down.",

    "reviewBody": "I deliberately avoided seeing any trailers or pictures or anything that might have reduced the impact of The Avengers, but I don't think it would have made any difference. Simply put Joss Whedon has succeeded where so many others have failed in the past, most notably DC Comics,to bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screen,without alienating the fans or confusing the newbies, and seemingly the hardest task, to make it a good movie. An indication of how he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter, who gets dragged to all the Iron Man, Green Lantern, etc, movies with me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly (mostly). However after leaving The Avengers she declared it her favourite movie ever. I can't comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the previous Marvel/Avengers Characters movies, but I think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who Iron Man, The Hulk and Captain America are, you should be able to work the rest out from there. I saw it in 3D and it was good, but I wouldn't say the 3D is a must. But I would say see it on the big screen, and see it as soon as you can!",

    "reviewTitle": "Assemble ensemble",
    "reviewBody": "The critics so far are basically right about what makes it great. Virtually all of the reviewers have said it has excellent dialogue and great action set pieces.No one who is a fan of fantasy action movies could seriously deny how good this is as an action spectacle: the special effects are very good, and put to good use by Whedon and his team. The tracking shot through the midst of the final battle is amazing. The finale is a genuine classic battle scene, and is as good as anything that Steven Spielberg would have put together in the same circumstances.The movie is funny enough that IMDb should add 'comedy' to its genre list. And all the other things the critics are repeating (so far, anyway) are true: mostly good acting, Ruffalo is especially good as Banner, character interactions are done very well, everyone gets enough to do that it feels like an ensemble movie, all of the title characters from the prior films are portrayed as well, or better than, in their own films blah blah blah...So all the good stuff we've been hearing/reading is basically true. What about the bad? There's less consensus around the bad, but probably general agreement that the plot as such isn't all that. It's basically the story as told on the cover of The Avengers comic #1: a team of powerful, but not unstoppable, individuals gather together to fight a foe no hero could stop alone. As Time Out's reviewer noted, the plot is basically just a coat-hanger for Whedon to build his character arcs and action sequences. But The Avengers was always likely to be limited by the need to be an origin story of sorts, and so I wasn't really expecting a lot more from the plot on this occasion; and the storytelling itself is very good, the way the character arcs were moved forward and entwined, was done very well. The alien army was an adequate, but not very innovative way to get Loki reinforcements and get a big battle for the heroes at the climax.The beginning was a bit clunky (several reviewers have used exactly that word) and I don't think it was a very helpful way to get audiences who hadn't seen the build-up movies into the film.There are potentially interesting themes of control, power and freedom (as Patrick Samuel touched on in his review at Static Mass Emporium), but these are not given sufficient fleshing out, leaving the movie in the 'summer blockbuster' category, albeit a much, much better than average example of that kind.Oh, and I'll say it again: The official title is stupid.But overall, I'd give it a 9/10. (Probably a 7 to 8 for those who haven't read the comics or followed the movie franchise closely.)",

Will Robert Downey Jr. ever get back to the brilliance of Iron Man 1 or have cocky dialogs won over a cool plot? b.) Mark Ruffalo as the hulk? Why not Edward Norton? c.) Hawkeye – not a superhero but just a guy with good aim. Black Widow – no powers again.is she just for eye-candy? d.) Will Hemsworth get more screen time and a better plot than what Thor offered him? e.) Loki the main villain – is this going to be yet another Thor vs Loki battle with the others just chipping in? f.) Will too many superheroes dilute the plot & will they be eating up each other's screen time? g.) Is technology going to win against a good storyline once again? (Ref: All the other Transformer films except the 1st!) h.) So many of them..will Iron Man hold fort in the \"team\"?Honestly I didn't even care for Evans and Captain America as much as I did for Thor & Iron Man. And I must say with the runtime being 145 minutes, I wondered if it would be a drag.THE VERDICTThe movie takes time to settle into the plot & setting up the characters, unlike Thor were I felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much more.The film IS LARGER THAN LIFE. Unlike Iron Man 2 or Captain America which left me wishing they had done more.Loki does a great job of portraying the villain. Thor delivers, Black Widow & Hawkeye are manageable. But nothing can compare to the fact that Ruffalo actually fits this version of Hulk way better than Norton could have done. And of course, Iron Man rocks. Rocks like he never did.By the time you reach the second half, the story has built in enough punch to make you wish there was an epic battle to follow and not a lame effort. And it does deliver. Great action, lot of mayhem, every superhero getting his screen time.Hulk & Iron Man indeed steal the show. Good dialogs & well timed comic quips here and therea perfect start to the 2012-13 tent-pole league. Now if only The Hobbit & Dark Knight Rises keep up to this level, its gonna be a great year! :)",

After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enough.The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. It's all pretty usual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. It's in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasn't expecting: a family comedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain America's and Thor's expense are great (\"Easy there Point Break\") with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the film's climax, Hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the film's main weakness, Marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lee's 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the film's biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Bruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time ever that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and applause when Chris Evans delivered the line: \"Hulk, SMASH!\" and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.A few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renner's unbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 Marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure her sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the Stan Lee cameo is present of course.Which brings us to the film's action sequences. They are astounding.Like Transformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America try to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then there's the climactic \"glorious war!\" which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can throw any enemies you want at The Avengers.The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero; brilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedon's directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or \"kiddy\" (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to it's better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.My one BIG problem with the film was the untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasn't even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can only hope.Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google \"Thanos\" and the \"Infinity Gauntlet\" when you get home.All in all it was GREAT fun & I honestly can not wait for Whedon's Directors's Cut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to incorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these characters.REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many years to come.9/10 Well and truly Assembled.",

    "reviewTitle": "Epitome of a Comic Book Movie",
    "reviewBody": "**SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM**So last night I attended the Australian premiere of \"The Avengers\" and yes, this was the most entertaining and impressively \"THORsome\" movie that I've ever seen. Like most comic book fans, I was looking forward to this since Nick Fury's appearance at the end of \"Iron Man\", so there was great hype and expectation. This movie is the epitome of a comic book being brought to life - the action scenes were surreal, the emotional content was tranquil, and somehow, Joss Whedon managed to add in a mere perfect story line and a charade of comedic lines for each of the amazing characters.Sublime performances were put in by all the main actors, but special mentions must go to Mark Ruffalo, who in my opinion, played the perfect Bruce Banner (I was never a fan of Edward Norton - sorry), and Tom Hiddleston, who's Loki was devastatingly cruel and yet charming in the same manner. In the case of Banner, Ruffalo portrays him in such a way that we are reminded that there is a darker, more sinister side to this man than the calm and reserved doctor in the room. Of course Robert Downey Jr.'s presence is always felt on screen and nothing changes in this movie, as he delivers most of the hilarious dialogue (at one point he even recited Shakespeare while fighting Thor in the forest). There is not one single dull or wasted scene in this movie, every single one has its purpose, whether it be filled with witty dialogue or explosive action. An example of the aforementioned dialogue: Thor: \"Loki is beyond reason, but he is my brother\" Black Widow: \"Your brother just killed 80 people in the last two days\" Thor:\".....he's adopted...\" At which point everyone in the cinema erupted with laughter. Of course my favorite was Thor, who engaged in an intense battle with the Hulk on board the Helicarrier.Essentially, \"The Avengers\" takes us on a roller coaster ride, through emotional highs and lows of all the characters. One of the interesting components was seeing how members of the team would react when they were in the same room, and the portrayal of ego clashes did not disappoint. SPOILER ALERT: It takes a while for the dynamics of the Avengers to settle, catalyzed by the death of Agent Coulson. But once they assemble, the ending action sequence is simply awe-inspiring. The Hulk proves there is nothing he cannot smash (including Loki), Chris Hemsworth's Thor gave most of the audience a massive \"THORgasm\" by summoning all that thunder and lightning from Mjolnir, Captain American/Black Widow/Hawkeye more than hold their own against a formidable foe, and Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man steals the show by proving that he is a team player and sacrificing himself to nuke the portal of the Chitauri. And what Avengers movie would be complete with that circling camera shot of the team preparing for battle while standing in a back to back formation, with Iron Man initially hovering over them. The background music made that moment PERFECT. If I did have one complaint, it would be the lack of background narrative showing how Thor returns to earth, although Loki does deduce that Odin must have conjured dark magic for Thor to return. However, the mid-credits scene was mind-blowing, revealing Thanos as the mastermind behind Loki's invasion and setting up a possible storyline for \"The Avengers 2\". In conclusion, this was one of, if not the best movies that I have ever seen. Thanks for reading and enjoy the movie!!! =]",

    "reviewTitle": "Was it great? No. Good? Only just...",
    "reviewBody": "Lots of money, lots of CGI, high-powered cast, half-assed story. That about sums up the latest Joss Whedon extravaganza.**spoilers** The story: clunky. It doesn't flow easily. Joss Whedon's script is okay, and even hints at deeper themes, but is ultimately a bit tacky and shallow. Some welcome laughs here and there, but pretty average scripting.IMDb at time of writing has it at 8.6. 8.6? Not even close. Flat 7 at best. I'm giving it 5 because, for all that money (and there was a hell of a lot of it), it's a pretty poor effort.Big time films seem to be in a trend of having convoluted stories rather than great storytelling, and The Avengers follows that trend. The whole \"causing dissension among the ranks\" fails significantly because it relies on the super-heroes forgetting all the struggles & personal growth they've been through in previous films. The Avengers tries to present them as reluctant, and egotistical (which of course they luckily overcome), but they've already been through things like this in their own films. Why have they regressed? Perhaps the reason is that Hollywood largely eschews the time-tested concept of character growth for flashy SFX that the kiddies like so much. It's sad, and results in hollow films. Like The Avengers, for example.The CGI: Pretty good, but has flying worms ala the latest Transformers flick, but not as cool.The cast: Not too bad. Scarlett Johansson in a tight outfit, and the usual cast of Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans etc etc.Overall, it's got high-wattage stars, lots of CGI, and not much impact, tension or heart.Better than Battleship (as if that was hard), not as good as Iron Man 1. Enjoyable and immediately forgettable. It'll make loads of money and probably even a sequel.",

    "reviewTitle": "A very entertaining Movie but with some serious flaws in the story",
    "reviewBody": "I went today to the 3d version of the movie in Antwerpen Belgium. Let me start to say it is very entertaining and its almost more a comedy than a Marvel Movie. Why i not rate this movie higher is because there a lot of flaws in the storyline and they step over a lot of issues to easy. Iff you compare that for example with X-Men First class or Ironman the story lines are much better so i don't really understand why the reviewers before me don't talk about that enough. The enemy is very weak(almost a single shot would kill them) and i still don't understand why Loki was doing in the plane and why he would let them catch him... And the attackers were saying that there boss would come what happened with him ? Also no variation in the enemy and what about the hoovering cockroaches who only flew against buildings did nothing. From characters the black-widow was pointless she is just shooting with a gun and Hawkeye is shooting with a bow how is that faster than a gun. This movie was saved in the first part by Tony Stark character extremely funny and the Hulk character in the second part of the movie. But how Hulk came a very smart monster who knows what he's doing i still don't know. But still its a movie worth going to the cinema but its def. not a movie which is worth a 8.4",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers Review spoiler free.",
    "reviewBody": "OK so this is my first review I've done so sorry if it isn't grade A standard.I'll start off by saying before you see this movie make sure you watch the movies that lead up to The Avengers it doesn't take away from the experience but you'll get to know the characters better and add depth to them all. The 3-D nothing special maybe one part that did it well but other then that just your usual converted 3-D. The characters were good Tom Hiddleston (my opinion) out shines them all except for Robert Downey Jnr but maybe its because I'm a big fan of Robert and Mark Ruffalo performed well. There is some good comedy in there even during the final battle. One problem I had though was with Captain America suit, I know it's part of him and from the comics but I felt like I couldn't take him seriously and by the end of it Hulk didn't feel like Hulk I would explain but I feel like it would spoil things. That being said though I still enjoyed the movie. Please take into concern this is MY opinion don't take it seriously, people like different things. Thank you for your time.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Fan Service",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel's Avengers: Joss Whedon I'm officially your number 1 Fanboy and a believer",
    "reviewBody": "Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever – Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys – to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie – Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud: JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines – not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully – I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie – they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza – Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids. Go watch that movie!!!",

I did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did.Sure, it's not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view, but it delivers perfectly.The wit, conflict, adventure, heart and sense of wonder that I once found in my crazy uncle's attic, slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty Marvel Magazines - populated with super-soldiers, handsome flying scientists, Norse gods, green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather - are here.As I grew up, I somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness. These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this with my 10 year old nephew. I don't know if that makes me the crazy uncle, but it sure was great to be back in that attic, even for a while. I always knew Hulk smashed. Now I know he always will.",

Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars. The script was nicely done and the dialogue really reflect the minds of each character. Really, The Avengers is the complete package of entertainment that engaged me with lots of thrills and absolutely no boring moments. I highly recommend it.",

    "reviewTitle": "As Much Fun As I've Ever Had In The Cinema!!!!!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "Ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A WINNER! Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough. Maybe it's the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans of other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really click. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters. What's also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I can't thank them enough for that factor. They knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise. Avengers is a complete and very well done movie and as much fun as I've ever had in the cinema. That's no lie or no joke.",

    "reviewTitle": "Entertaining. Should not disappoint the masses.",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers is exactly what I expected. It is action packed, it understandably doesn't have much time for character development (although we do see more of Hawkeye and Black Widow than in previous Marvel installments), and the relentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there - especially by Tony Stark and, surprisingly, the Hulk (they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around Hulk's utter brutality).The lack of character development, especially for Thor (who does seem somewhat out of place in this film) but also Bruce Banner, is probably what hurts The Avengers the most. I didn't actually need any character development since I've seen all previous Marvel films at least twice, but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback - it feels wrong even though I was expecting it considering the number of characters already established. I can hardly imagine anyone who hasn't seen the previous films enjoying The Avengers because of that.I usually don't care that much for relentless CGI action films, but some sequences in The Avengers were so blatantly incredible that I had to enjoy them. Notably, a sequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one Avenger kicking butt to the other - that was really well done and exciting. Loki was once again a brilliant villain and the perfect choice for the first Avengers film.Overall, a very good action ride bringing our favorite superheros together. The movie doesn't try to be pretentious and goes straight to business - which is what it should do.",

One of the first countries to watch an early screening of the most anticipated films of this year is a great great experienced. This film has a great actions, acceptable comedy (Especially Stark and Hulk, yeah Hulk!)and a serious emotions. All the actors did a great job portraying their role, and the visual effects are amazing, my favorite character in this movie is \"Hulk\", I mean I hate him in the other movies, but in this film, whoa he's great, he's strong and heavy (Funny when he smash \"Thor\"), and Black Widow, whoa... she's not only hot but she's also dangerous, well overall it was an amazing experience. I wanna see it again, I'll rate it a 8.5 over 10! ASSEMBLE!",

    "reviewBody": "I just came out of the cinemas from watching it on the first day and I have to admit it was better than I expected. I expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes, and that's what you get, world class entertainment. I enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning. Also this movie has a chunk of comedy, not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film (too much). It was cliché but what can you expect. The actor's are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be. The only part I really didn't like, but also didn't expect was the lack of feeling. A lot of the good movies I watch I come out feeling different, like the movie has effected me, but I felt nothing, (except for one part but it wasn't enough to give a real feeling to the movie). All in all, this is an action packed movie, sure to give you entertainment, not boring at all, funny, has some smart moments and a must see movie for anyone.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's Iron Man's world and the rest of the Avengers just live in it, apparently...",
    "reviewBody": "As one of the seemingly few who's not a fan of the Iron Man character or his films, and after seeing the trailers, I had my reservations about this film. Was it going to be Iron Man 3, guest-starring the rest? Well, yes and no. It's clear who Joss Whedon's favourites are, as they get the most character development. Those who come out on top: Tony Stark (of course), Black Widow and (surprisingly) Bruce Banner/Hulk. If you're a fan of these characters/the actors who portray them, then you should be satisfied with their amount of screen time.Fans of Stark, who don't mind his attitude and want nothing more than his mumbled speedy snarky lines/blowing stuff up will be the most pleased. Annoyingly, even his love interest gets to be the only one to appear in this film (too bad for Peggy Carter & Jane Foster, both of whom I greatly prefer as characters. Though at least we get to see a *picture* of them and it's mentioned that Jane's safe. I wish Thor had been allowed to reunite with her before he left again). RDJ does his thing, and he's naturally fine doing it, but I'm probably in the minority who prefers him as Sherlock in his Sherlock Holmes films.Captain America thankfully gets to retain his likability, calls Tony out on his BS (there's more than one scene of two verbally sparring) and has his moments of leadership. I was annoyed, however, that his practical costume from CA: TFA was replaced with one that looked like the comical outfit he wore when promoting war bonds during the 'Star Spangled Man' song/dance number in his solo film. It's pretty clear Whedon views him as a 'dork' of sorts, so he's reduced to the butt of jokes and not getting to be 'cool' like Stark. Even with Whedon's clear bias against him, Steve continues to be the most likeable/noble hero.Scarlett Johansson gets to kick sufficient ar$e as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and does a good job of subverting the obvious (something Whedon is a fan of...along with scenes where everyone yells over the top of each other). There are a few moments where it appears she's beaten/showing signs of weakness, but then she turns things on their head and she proves herself to be no damsel and more than capable/not to be underestimated. The one somewhat 'regressive' role Whedon sticks her in is 'beauty taming the beast' in regards to her character and the Hulk.Speaking of the 'other guy'(as Bruce calls him), this Hulk looks better than the two previous movie versions thanks to motion-capture allowing Mark Ruffalo to actually portray the not-so-jolly green giant and even his face bears resemblance to Ruffalo. Bruce gets to be all brooding and restrained for the bulk of the movie, but when he eventually Hulks out, he does plenty smash-o-crash. Unfortunately, Hulk is also played for some rather immature laughs at times, like when he punches Thor after they've just teamed up to take down a baddie (why? Because it's \"FUNNY\"!) or he cuts Loki off mid-speechifying by tossing him around like a ragdoll, thus kinda undoing all the effort Tom Hiddleston put into making Loki menacing (there's one exchange he has with Natasha where he comes across truly evil). It's clear Whedon's not a fan of 'god-like' characters and hopes to sway others to be like-minded.Nick Fury gets to be sneaky/manipulative, jumps on the 'Let's blame Thor' train and shoots stuff, as does his offside, Agent Hill (Cobie Smulders), when she's not providing exposition or miraculously escaping death. Hawkeye fans might be a tad miffed that he spends the majority of the film zombiefied by Loki, but is eventually freed of the mind-control and his backstory with Natasha is briefly touched upon. Even Agent Coulson gets a fair amount of development. Disappointingly, Thor gets the short end of the stick...or hammer. I'd thoroughly enjoyed his solo movie and Chris Hemsworth in the role, so I was hoping he'd get the respect/focus he deserved as part of this ensemble cast...but it seemed Tony Stark's one-liners and the Hulk beating Asgardian ar$e for laughs was Whedon's priority, sadly.Poor Thor never seems to be allowed to have a true victory in the film, which is a real disappointment since his character had undergone a true hero's journey in his own film and deserved to be taken seriously, rather than disrespected/treated as the butt of jokes. Sure, he and 'Mew Mew' get to kick a fair amount of butt, but not nearly enough as they *should've*. He doesn't even get to be the one who takes down Loki (his brother...who's adopted) in the end and save everyone, as that victory's given Iron Man and Hulk, of course (and Thor had been about to save Stark's ar$e at the end too until Hulk swooped in and stole his thunder). Such a shame that Thor gets screwed over, but I appreciated his little moments of humour (all the more effective because they *aren't* OTT or at the expense of others) and that he brought some actual seriousness to proceedings/his complicated sibling relationship with Loki wasn't entirely ignored.Despite my few quibbles, the film surprisingly comes together pretty well. Whedon proves he can direct action with the best of them and it's blissfully free of overuse of shaky-cam. It's quite the feat, bringing all these characters from different films together and actually making it *work*, but he pulls it off. Not a dollar of the movie's considerable budget has been wasted. It's all up there on the screen, the humour works (some of the time), all the actors do well in their roles, but I personally would've liked to have spent more time with Cap & Thor and exploring their reluctant partnership (how about a buddy film?). I'm more invested in their own solo films than seeing them sharing time with characters who I'm not a fan of, but not opposed to seeing the Avengers reassemble.",

    "reviewBody": "Yep, I'll be honest, I did cringe a little when I found out Joss Whedon was directing, I absolutely love his work but I just could not see how his talents would be able to be used to make this sort of film. I am so happy to say that I was wrong! The film allows you to enjoy every moment as it passes especially when at the end you realised you've just sat through 2 hours and 20 minutes of concentration.Like you expect, we're all re-introduced to all the characters, one by one off doing their own thing and S.H.I.E.L.D trying to bring them all together. The good thing about this is when they do all eventually start to get together you get the all too normal tension between a group of individuals being almost forced together with the expectations from S.H.I.E.L.D that they automatically work together as some fantastic team. Aside from all the action scenes, explosions, fights etc etc You still get the storyline the whole time, if you step back and look at the whole storyline you realise that it's a pretty semi-typical script but the whole film you don't even realise that's happening, it really brings comic films to a new meaning. The biggest adjustment for myself and I'm sure many other viewers was the role of Tony Stark/ Iron Man. Though Downey Jr reprised the role fantastically (no surprise), both Iron Man films had kept to the human story lines, The Avengers introduced the film character into the world of science fiction. With the Iron Man films you could keep some sort of natural relationship with the storyline and characters because all was somewhat believable (in the Action movie sense). But with saying that as you watch the movie and you make your own adjustments to this, so is Stark himself so it ties in perfectly with the audience which is another hats off moment for Whedon.Another fantastic thing and is one of the defining points of this film, is the comedic input. Almost every comic film is known as being all action and drama, you feel like you have to be serious the whole time (ofcourse minor funny moments but nothing good), Joss Whedon has taken account the audience and the 21st century and made some key scenes in the film so much better and less awkward, it had the entire cinema erupt in laughter. Though with saying that, and you reading it might make you stand off-ish, the way it's worked into the scene it would be just as impressive even if it was just kept to a dramatic scene.This film had chance of being really well made or an absolute laughable flop. It has impressed me and it has impressed many many other people, I look forward to hearing further reviews as it opens in cinema's around the world. The writers, directors, producers and the cast have all worked together amazingly and I cannot wait for future projects!",

    "reviewTitle": "A great merge of many great movies",
    "reviewBody": "As many, I have been waiting for this film since ages. As I was quite fond of all the previous Avenger movies, I obviously had great expectations, some were fulfilled and some were not. The movie started quite thrilling. Bringing in the Chitauri was brilliant, I kinda wish they would have got a bigger part in the story than just being the bad-ass alien army to defeat. But of course, as the film had so many things to expand it would have been a little bit too much. And that was quite the bad point in the movie, even though I was expecting it to happen. With so many main characters and with all their background stories, there was not enough time to unfold everything that was behind the story. By that I mean, some of the characters were not even near as complex as in the previous movies. For example, I think Thor turned out to be pretty one-sided in this film. I really liked the movie Thor and while it was obvious that most characters were not going to be in this one, I still missed Hopkins, Portman and Dennings, mostly because the character of Thor was more like the angry prince like in the beginning of the movie Thor, rather than the wise king he had became in the end of it. Another problem the amount of characters brought up was that the movie was a bit too fast. Unlike the calmer nature of the original films, in this one there was always something happening, mostly fight scenes. I love fight scenes and usually enjoy them to the most, but only with a fine balance of them and calmer moments. Of course in short terms, it was very amazing and exciting, but when it came to the death scene of Coulson, as Fury sat next to him in silence had I only realized how tired one can get of seeing almost nothing but battles for an entire movie. Yet, as I've said before, with so many characters making this film calmer would have been simply impossible. The acting otherwise was really nice, the crew seemed to do their best during the whole film. Smulders was a pleasant surprise, she was truly marvelous in the role of Agent Hill. Ruffalo was just as well a good exchange of Norton, he made the character of Bruce Banner very likable. The scores also did catch up to the spirit of the film pretty well, the music kept you in the mood during the whole time. As for the amazing sides of the film, the visuals were utterly cutting-edge. 3D effects were not that outstanding though, guess it still does not really worth the headache. For a sequel (as I hope one will happen in the near future), I just hope that they will have more space and time to expand the characters' personalities a bit more precisely. As for the first film to merge all these stories, I don't think they could have done any better. Maybe not the best directing nor the best superhero movie of all time, but for sure is a fun film to watch with many great moments and good acting. A must-see for all Marvel fans.",

    "reviewTitle": "A rollicking good ride.",
    "reviewBody": "Four years ago Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appeared in Iron Man's end credit scene and whipped the comic book geek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since then we've witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled in self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show: The Avengers. It was worth the wait.Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action, laugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether it's the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in the forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and, along with the series' best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark – the Hulk's reaction to Loki belittling him had me in tears – and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot. However, perhaps Whedon's most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who continue their great work from the franchise's previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never over-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad slow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments. Bring on the sequel.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Perfectly Crafted Super Hero Movie",
    "reviewBody": "So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel! Go Joss!! filmnotion.com",

    "reviewBody": "The Avengers is simply a superb movie in every way that matters. Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clichéd about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic.",

    "reviewTitle": "Very entertaining. Superhero ensemble done right.",
    "reviewBody": "Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude of characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with the rest simply playing supporting roles. They needn't have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet well-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Loki's stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in \"Thor\" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the most interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the role surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who doesn't really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best performance by far is by Hiddleston. As the film's primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes' heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man behind \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" and \"Firefly\", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece. Following in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice for this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major character, to the film's many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the film's special effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous live-action portrayal, Loki's army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future installments). While it won't win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven story with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice, and will thrill audiences from beginning to end.",

    "reviewTitle": "Words cannot describe how good this movie is!! A MUST SEE",
    "reviewBody": "I have to say this movie was out of this world. Exactly what any big fan of comics or of all the marvel movies wanted. There was just enough of every character involved. I know a large debate can be had on the characters not being like they are in the comics or the plots being different but behind it all they cant just make a really long boring movie with every detail involved!! Its definitely not a movie for the person who doesn't like the previous movies. The acting of Robert Downey Jr was brilliant and the addition of the new hulk Mark Ruffalo was even better. It could been debated that Ed Norton would of been better but if you ask me personally the new hulk was outstanding! The movie experience in 3D was also very good. I am not a huge fan of 3D movies from the past, but after watching the avengers, marvel did a great job in all the action scenes where they took full use of the 3D effects. Over all its a must see action/adventure movie. 10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "First True SuperHero Movie!",
    "reviewBody": "OK, I know 10/10 scores are thrown in too lightly n ow a days, but hear me out, this movie is truly astonishing. Following the storyline directly from Thor 2011, this movie starts strong with Loki trying to conquer earth, from there its just a wild ride, it grips on you and you won't be able to catch your breath until way after the credits.The thing that I appreciate the most, is that its a true SuperHero movie, often in comics adaptations, the directors try to ground the actions and powers, worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium. Well, not here, The action is unbelievable, the feats of strength breathtaking Ironman shoots its repulsor beams, Thor uses his lightning strike.Lastly it wouldn't have worked without the humor, Wheedon, has perfect chops, each time his punchlines will take you off guard, and trust me laugh you will.I watched this in a really packed theater, the function was sold out one week before, a record in my country. Everyone was cheering, laughing, clapping and wowing. a truly special spectacle.Really F***ING Amazing.",

    "reviewTitle": "The very definition of 'crowd pleaser.'",
    "reviewBody": "Anzac day. Public holiday. Late night session. Not an empty seat in the house. The atmosphere was at a deserved premium for the year's most anticipated film, and The Avengers did not disappoint. The king of sci-fi television, director Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly) enlists the help of one Samuel L. Jackson in assembling Earth's mightiest heroes to protect humanity against the greatest threat to our existence in history. Sounds pretty stockstandard, right? It should, because The Avengers makes no move towards trying to reinvent the genre, but rather takes everything that makes a film like this enjoyable and cranks it to eleven, proving there's some life in the blockbuster yet.All is peaceful on planet Earth with the all-powerful Cosmic Cube safely in the hands of Nick Fury and SHIELD. That is until Loki, Thor's evil half-brother from another realm, storms the castle and commits larceny of the grandest scale. His actions convince Fury that the world is indeed at war, and he is left with no choice but to reinstate the Avengers Initiative. With it, he brings together The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and the big cheese Iron Man to take down this mighty foe. Unfortunately, all signs point to the superheroes killing each other before saving the Earth. 'Cause, you know, priorities.The film's unquestioned drawcard has always been its ensemble cast and, more importantly, the potential for spectacular chemistry between the leads. This forced sceptics to beg the question: How long will this gimmick last before everyone starts to get in each other's way? The final product allays such concerns with ease, as Whedon, his fellow writers and the actors all deserve equal credit for their depiction of the superteam as the ultimate dysfunctional family. To the mere mortal, a superhero can appear angelically honourable and beyond reproach. Throw four of five of them into one room and they become stubborn, irritable and deviously arrogant just like the rest of us. Watching this dynamic progressively unfold throughout the film is a treat, as the Avengers bicker over almost anything, all with a watch-me-prove-I'm-better-than-you macho attitude. A witty script almost entirely devoid of clichés that allows room for sufficient individual character development certainly helps this dynamism. Stark copes with fighting for something greater than himself for once, Banner draws sympathy as a brilliant mind struggling with a crippling case of split personality and the contrasting ideas Thor and Loki possess regarding freedom, arguably the film's most prominent theme, all contribute to the film's depth without disrupting the excellent pacing.Walking into this film in the right frame of mind, one would find most minor flaws few and far between. Not every one-liner or scripted joke hits the mark, in typical Marvel fashion, and Cobie Smulders' character comes off as underused and unnecessary in stark contrast (no pun intended) to her prominence in the trailers. Kudos must also go to the execution of the 'megascene', that is, the forty-minute climactic battle between the Avengers and Loki's army. While it is certainly nothing new, the megascene has become more and more of a staple in major action franchises of late, including the last Harry Potter and Transformers films. The ambitious nature of the set piece by sheer design means things can get ugly and repetitive in a hurry if care is not taken to ensure the audience is engaged at all times (see: Dark of the Moon). With The Avengers, though, the final act is not only visually fascinating, but also mentally stimulating, constantly jumping between various settings and characters involved, with new developments occurring every couple of minutes to ensure one doesn't even come close to losing interest. After a string of commercially dominant but critically indifferent projects, it appears Marvel has finally hit the jackpot in every sense of the word.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",

    "reviewBody": "Meh.In this movie there's everything you expect, just as you expect it: extremely noisy action scenes, a multimillionaire budget flaunted without restraint, superhero brawls, New York invaded by aliens for the 2.735.961th time and the usual Stan Lee cameo.I suppose that's enough to satisfy Marvel zombies.To me, it seems like Mr. Whedon worked alternating the autopilot with the Copy & Paste function. For example, the showdown against Loki's army is basically Transformers 3 final battle with different characters, and a less talented direction.The only real surprises come from humor: I have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny. Apart from this, you'll find nothing but cheesy costumes, woody and/or pointless dialogues, tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go nowhere (Black Widow, with all that chatting aimlessly about her past, is particularly confusing).And Thor's hammer is blatantly fake.",

Original jokes, even when you don't suspect it. I laugh so hard, i was crying and is not a so called funny movie, like American pie.. The type of the characters are clearly distinguishable, and is the same as in the previous movies. But even if you didn't saw them, you can fully enjoy it, but if you did, it adds something extra. It's full of action, and even when it is not so much going on the screen you never feel like that something is missing or boring. It is the perfect movie to switch off, laugh hard and enjoy what's happening on the screen.",

The hulk in this movie unlike its previous incarnation is modelled on a gorilla, yes king kong! I didn't like that at all, its look, movement and facial expressions. I wanted to see a powerful superhuman not a monkey in a circus \"you'll know what i mean\" lol.The reason I gave my review an extra star is because there were moments where i laughed. It is funny. But this doesn't make up for the weak cliché'd story and forced boring dialogue cut scenes between action sequences.The other star goes to the setting and set designs, which were appreciated.The acting was good but the film's action reminded me of a WWE Royal Rumble match. Can't wait for the DARK KNIGHT RISES! It may raise my IQ.thanks",

    "reviewTitle": "Damn near perfect",
    "reviewBody": "The movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the Earth will soon face. A little too much time is spent with the 'peripheral' characters; black widow, Hawkman and Fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with Loki, the film picks up pace. What follows is entertaining but I think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations. For example a fight match-up that was mean't for the big-screen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more. All is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think you've seen the finale it just keeps going. The last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though I do wonder if the budget for CGI could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly. The humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes. One of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesn't get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass.",

With the style of the Xmen & Spiderman films, in addition to the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain American films; it was pretty clear what type of movie this was going to be. Big, loud, slick, exciting, and light on story. Joss Whedon's influence has made for a much better movie, his witty and sometimes intelligent screenplay lifts this from a middle of the road Marvel movie to something that is a great popcorn movie. All the performances are spot-on, and the photography and cgi beautiful. This is very much a movie for the fans, but anyone can enjoy it. Don't expect a complex interwoven plot, but a classic good guys v bad guys movie. Loads of fun, so leave your brain at the door and dive in!",

We get to enjoy a classic comparison of \"real people\" in a world of \"super people\"... the beats are perfect... I found myself feeling hugely impressed at the skill set and technology of the shield operatives, then completely sorry for them when they are thrust into the world of the Avengers. The Avengers themselves were pitched at a power level far greater than set up in the preceding movies, but they were only the better for it. The speed of the impacts, the level of catastrophic damage that they leave in their wake... all perfect. The only missed opportunity I felt was for Captain America... still too much of the poster boy soldier, and not enough of the Captain, except when he is dealing with shield agents, or policemen... and I still wanted the Captain to move more like Bronski did in the Hulk. Thor is definitely a God in this, and the Hulk is definitely a poorly guided atomic bomb. Iron Man and Banner's intelligence was a blast to watch, and the swagger of Stark is nicely offset by moments of fear for the limitations of his tech. I gripped my seat, with the peril, and I laughed out loudly (along with the entire audience) at the moments... you will know when you do too... I should have stayed in my seat for another viewing...",

    "reviewTitle": "Very good, but not the greatest.",
    "reviewBody": "Hey guys. I've written a HUGE review of this. Here is the first few paragraphs. Head over to www.thecrat.com to read my full review.Disclaimer: if you're anything like me, you want to go into The Avengers as blind as possible. I will try to avoid addressing the majority of the plot, but when I have to clearly address plot points I will mark them as spoilers.2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever. With new entries into some of the most beloved franchises of all time (Lord of the Rings, Alien, James Bond and Batman) it is a good year to be a film geek. The first of the year's massive releases arrives in the form of The Avengers (sorry, Hunger Games, you have the box office, but not the scope to join the heavy hitters). The question everyone (or just geeks) is asking: is this the best comic book film ever? I would have to answer with an emphatic no. This film is big, huge in fact, and it gets a lot of things right. But I also think, considering the pedigree and lead-up to this film, The Avengers should have been a game-changer. Unfortunately, it is not.The Avengers is the culmination of the 'Marvel Studios' Cinematic Universe'. Marvel has created a series of films starring their heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and The Incredible Hulk) that all coincide in the same reality (just like the comic books). This connectivity has been planned from the start so that when Marvel was ready, they could join these characters into a single film. That moment has arrived with The Avengers. The Avengers is primarily made for fans of these films: if you have skipped the previous films and missed the back-story, you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limited.The plot of The Avengers sees the demigod Loki (the great, snarling Tom Hiddleston) planning to enslave the entirety of the human race. Minor spoilers: after his exile in Thor, Loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe, one controlled by an alien race known as the Chitauri (the identity of this race is inconsequential, and it is revealed within the first few moments of The Avengers). Loki plans to use the Chitauri's numbers to achieve his goal of world domination. Once Loki makes his presence known on earth, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to unite earth's mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating Loki and the Chitauri.The man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is Joss Whedon. Whedon acts as the writer and director of The Avengers and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet. Mainly known for his television work (Buffy and Firefly), Whedon has only ever directed one other film: the low-scale (compared to The Avengers) Serenity. Marvel Studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested (in big budget films) actors and directors to make their films (the recovering addict Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, the relatively unknown Chris Hemsworth as Thor) and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously. Unfortunately, Whedon isn't exactly one of them. Despite being an authority on geek culture, Whedon's pacing, plot and cinematic eye are good, but they still leave a lot to be desired. This is a quantum leap in terms of his career and Whedon (mostly) steps up to the plate. The Avengers would be a daunting prospect for any director, let alone one with a single film under their belt. Whedon is largely regarded for his writing and in The Avengers it is very much hit and miss. He nails the characters' voices and his dialogue is mostly fantastic (except for a few Downey Jnr quips – but knowing him, I'd imagine they are improvised).However, his basic plot framework is quite muddled. A film of this calibre should function like a well-oiled machine, not feel like it is made out of spare parts. To read the rest head to www.thecrat.com",

    "reviewTitle": "Take note....fan boys CAN make decent films",
    "reviewBody": "Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. For those of you who don't know who this man is, he's been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spin off movie, Serenity. But, this is Whedon's first big feature film, it's also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task. Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.In the first issue of the comic , the team are assembled to fight Thor's brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction. Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedon's script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, \"Let's dance\" as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes! The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from Shield. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage – a lot of damage!It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust \"fan boys\" with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the \"prequels\" and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite. It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his \"I am a God\" speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the film's final act – the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesn't get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didn't pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.I have long appreciated Whedon's film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.This is the BEST comic book – SUPERHERO – film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers- Best movie of the year so far. Fans salivate, non fans- prepare to get converted!",
    "reviewBody": "The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be \"hilariously out gunned\" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- \"billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist\"- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an \"oh so serious\" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- \"hold on\", he seems to say, \"the solution is just round the corner\"- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun.",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing, and I will break down why",
    "reviewBody": "When the Tesseract suddenly activates itself, it briefly opens a portal. A small one, but nonetheless it allows Loki(who uses his illusions well) to pass through... and he now has a sceptre that allows him to take over people by touch. He escapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy, and with the threat of it being used to allow an invasion of Earth by the alien force the Chitari, what can Fury do other than... Assemble Avengers. This is an excellent piece, that lives up to the hype. It will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike. A lot of people will be exclaiming that, so I will try to back it up instead of just fawning over this(and believe me, I could go 1000 words just doing that). It follows up on all... no, *all*... of the threads set up in the five films that came before(and yes, it will really help to have watched all of them before this... then again, if you have any interest in this, you probably already have). Nothing is abandoned or ignored. The sheer planning that went into this... and this is still full of fantastic surprises. And for all the development(all of that in this is highly credible, by the way) of characters, powers and conflicts(and this takes the ball and runs with it, and adds the interpersonal relationships of these people who have not shared a screen before now, who are rather different people) that precedes this, there is a solid amount of it in this, as well. All six(and no, you can't tell that two of them, one of them especially, haven't gotten much screen time before this) members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introduction(actually, that goes for Nick and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, both very cool, as well), a strong heroic act that only they could have accomplished, *and*... a situation of immense peril(not to mention that they(and we) are treated to one continuous tracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent, one by one, once they've grown into a team, working together... no, they don't start out like that, and yes, there is indeed infighting early on, and yes, we get every one-on-one that anyone wants, and it is glorious... the trailer is literally just the preview). All of them have something to do(and they are recruited gradually, no one overshadowing anyone else... and somehow, this gets all the aspects that make them work individually, in their own movies, somehow, without getting tonal schizophrenia), some reason to be in this, and the threat(Hiddleston is friggin' intimidating) is grand enough that we need all of them, and for them to band together. Tony has to prove that he is selfless, that he doesn't just fix his own mistakes(and he brings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks, that come out to putting a severe dent in the enemies). Steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him, and bring them all into one, effective unit(and he is the great leader that is required, one that you yourself would follow, and, indeed, a Super Soldier(a title he earns)). Thor(who brings godlike might, and a Shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy) and Natasha(who is the real brains of the operation, and can manipulate the foe... they use one of her qualities well, that being her apparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not) are dealing with a lot of guilt, on account of it being an Asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her... dark past as a spy who'd take on missions for or against anyone, respectively. Clint(who brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy to good use) has his own to make amends for(you'll see...). Bruce(who comes with the sheer destructive weight of his alter ego) is brought on for his expertise on the subject of Gamma radiation(he can help find the vital cube), and... I don't need to spell out what he feels bad about, do I? He does seem to have gotten the Hulk under control... or has he? This builds up the transformation, and he remains a danger. He's the only one to have another person attached to it than played it last, and while I had no problem with Norton(who I love in other stuff... in that, he didn't do all he could with it, though), this part is Ruffalo's. There is this very terrifying aspect to him, he could metamorphose and cause significant damage and pain... and he plays it like you'd expect him to be, very non-confrontational and anxious, yet smart and confident in his field. All of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind, saving countless people. There are not many supporting roles(Phil Coulson does return, and he is enjoyable, with a fandom of Cap; there's also a female agent named Hill, who kicks ass... in fact, every woman in this is hot, independent and not objectified... kudos for that, along with the rest, Whedon), with focus placed where it should be, on the ensemble cast. Is it necessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spot-on? You've already seen Chris, Robert and Liam do incredible, and they do so here, too. Everyone does. The writing is phenomenal. I am struggling to find one line of dialog(with Iron Man-like wit and banter) that isn't quotable, sharp and well-delivered. The action is plentiful, has distinct stages to it(none of that unaimed, mindless crap), culminating in a truly massive climax, and somehow never running out of steam or exhausting the audience. This keeps to a pitch perfect pace, and at nearly two and a half hours, there is nothing tedious or rushed. The FX? Breathtaking. 3D? Used right(only little distinctly moves towards/points at you). I recommend this to everyone who is considering it. 10/10",

I thought I got my money's worth and then some!!The main protagonists all deliver top-notch performances....and the flick is filled with great comic moments....For me, the stand-out performance in the movie was delivered by the Hulk!....The special effects & 3D were spot-on and the full repertoire of the Hulk's destructive power were encapsulated in some great action sequences (the battle with Thor, throwing Loki around like a rag-doll and the one-punch of the alien being notable highlights of the film)..My only criticism would be of the one-dimensional aliens....I think we've already seen enough giant bugs in plenty a movie!!It is not on a par with a Chris Nolan 'Batman' movie, nor, was it as intelligently crafted as the Watchmen Movie....Also, the storyline was fairly predictable from the off-set...The only recent comic ensemble that can challenge this movie (imo) was the latest X-Men prequel....Well Done Joss Whedon, and the rest of the Avengers team, I hope he can improve on this initial Avengers movie with an even better sequel.... In a nutshell...the Avengers Assemble delivers crash, bang and wallop in huge extremely satisfying doses!!",

    "reviewTitle": "An honest confession !!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "So much to say yet so little space .I feel like I am short of words today. But after watching this flick in IMAX reald 3d I figure all of you would be as speechless as I am. Where do I begin Where do I end? The moral dilemma I am in to write this review.But Joss Whedon was one guy who knew exactly where to start and where to end in this Marvel fantasy epic. Yes the marvel cinematic universe was already in place. All the characters had been pre-established and had their own individual fan following. So how do you get a bunch of franchises all into one? Just do what Mark Millar did in the Ultimates Vol.1.So you have a ready-made script which you need to modify very little of. Minor adjustments to make the 'Hulk' look like a good guy etc. and presto you have a script. Casting was never a problem anyway. Since Merril Lynch gave you 300 million USD to make this visual effects extravaganza the CGI was hardly ever going to be a problem with Industrial Lights and Magic on your side. But where Whedon succeeds is the characterization. Every one from Chris Evans(Captain America) to Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) have their own screen time to develop their characters and story. Marvel has done this before in X-men etc. but this movie just outdoes everything they ever made. The brilliance of Mr.Whedon is clearly seen here. I guess all those years of working in Buffyverse finally paid off! I initially thought it would be a Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) ride all the way. I even wore my Iron Man T-shirt as well. Thankfully it was not so everybody pitches in equally and its fun to watch.The plot line is pretty simple and straight forward. A bunch of aliens try to attack earth with Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) leading the way. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bring in 'The Avengers' to bash the alien scum out of Earth. We all know how it turns out but its fun to watch it the way it happens, the way joss makes it happen. Yes the final battle sequence feels a little 'Star Warsy' and 'Transformersy' with the alien airspeeders flying all over the place and huge gigantic slug like creatures falling out of the sky but its still amazing to watch and is a visceral treat. I just can't wait for Avengers 2 to come out.Hope they do the 'Civil War' storyline (also by Mark Millar the genius that he is...). Wondering where the confession part is in all of this.. well here it is .I enjoyed it like a guilty pleasure. For me it was revenge. Revenge on everyone who calls us avid comic book follower's geeks or junkies! It was a slap in the face to all the cocky bastards who criticized me ever since I was in sixth grade until now for reading comic books calling them kids' stuff. Those same guys would be inside the movie screens this week watching the 'Avengers' I am sure. If they are not well the they're even dumber than I thought. This movie brought back my memories of being a kid with bronchitis sitting on his bed dosed up with meds with nothing but a 'Captain America' and 'Iron Man' issue to keep him company. Of course I had the 'Justice League' and 'Batman' but since this is a marvel movie I will leave out the DC guys till TDKR comes out.I am no 'Captain America' but I am a patriot. Yeah the movie released in India a week earlier before the U.S which was uber cool. Also Bruce Banner is on the run and hiding in Calcutta so yes he speaks Hindi. Also the end credits track is played by Soundgarden (Chris Cornell) who happen to be one of my most favorite band of all time (Yeah my first love is comic books second is guitar based hard rock...go figure!!!!).Their lead guitarist is a guy of Indian origin. He is called Kim Thayil and he rocks hard.So to sum it all up whether your young or old assemble your fellow avengers go to your nearest movie screen and shout it out loud \" Avengers Assemble!\" and make Marvel all the money they deserve for giving us a fantastic movie experience.",

    "reviewTitle": "Box Office Avenged!!!! A complete treat..a must watch!!Go Go Go Avengers!!!",
    "reviewBody": "The very beginning of the movie is capable enough to build your interest and keeps you watching. The movies has many relative terms from other movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and people who haven't seen \"Captain America:The First Avenger\" or \"Thor\"or \"The Incredible Hulk\"or \"Ironman\" might have to scratch their heads at times...but that will not matter a lot because the movie will keep you laughing and will keep you in the moment, never letting you get bored. The movie is intense at many times, thrilling a sometimes too..but the action and comedy is amazing. Especially the scene where Loki is beaten up by Hulk like a washer-man's clothes will keep you laughing even after Hulk is finished up with his beating. Every time you start thinking that you are getting bored, and start sliding on your seat, something will happen in the movie and you will straighten up on your seat, waiting for more. The movie will keep on building a plot for action throughout its length and will blast your head with thrilling action scenes in the end. The performance by every actor is respectable. The dignity of each character is maintained. None of the superheroes is portrayed miser than others. Even Hawkeye and Black Widow gain audience's respect in the end. In short, the movie is a must watch and for the fans of any of The Avengers or the superheroes who are a part of it will commit a sin if they do not watch this movie.",

    "reviewBody": "since everyone has talked about the good pts. quite lengthily already, let me share my thoughts on why it still fell short of my expectations:didn't get what loki was up to with the whole alien invasion plan; i mean, what's his end-game assuming they win, when it seems the aliens are in it for themselvesspeaking of the aliens.. they're just too inept and posed almost no threat at all, other than the sheer size of their army. even black widow thrashed a number of them, when i was expecting the skill level and strength of these invaders would at least be \"capt America\" level; capt America.. now there's a character who was just embarrassingly poorly used. i felt like he was being bossed around by everyone, when in the comics, he is the true leader. the scene, where all of sudden, he was giving orders to everyone, was just trite. i mean, where was this even coming from? never showed any true leadership qualities for a good 2 hrs of the movie, and now he's calling the shots? could've been better developedand the team, after fighting and arguing the whole time, i just didn't see a good enough plot device for them to get their act together, for the big alien battle. it was just too abrupt for me, w/o any clear progression from individual issues to being integral members of a team. and the death of the agent as a trigger? c'mon! that's just lame. there was no emotional investment for anyone on the team to decide on what happened next. other than widow and hawkeye, who barely worked with the guy, the rest just didn't have anything much to do with guy, even ironman, for that matter. i think what i'm driving at is the transition, how these superheroes should have evolved from individuals to being members of the team, begged for improvement.minor gripe: though ruffalo did pretty well, i think the part wasn't as well written. hulk/banner character was just confusing. he attacks widow & thor, and next thing you know, he develops compassion, camaraderie, and heroic tendencies. plus, this banner is completely diff from the norton banner in terms of how he was written. can't imagine norton referring to \"hulk\" simply as the \"other guy\", and in that manner; was just so out of character for me.don't get me wrong, i did enjoy the movie. great action scenes. just wasn't too thrilled with the plot and story. they could have taken a page from the animated movie, \"ultimate avengers\". now, that was tight story that the live avengers movie could have been, even w/o giant man & wasp.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers: An Assembly of Sheer Awesomeness!!!",
    "reviewBody": "From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!",

    "reviewTitle": "Best. Comic Book Movie. EVER.",
    "reviewBody": "This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype – years and years worth of hype – might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines – especially the final line – feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly cliché.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little – enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year – whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer – and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say! And assemble, and assemble, and assemble again(And make sure you stay through the credits for the now-expected next-movie teaser Buffy and Angel fans will be particularly happy, even if they don't quite get the somewhat obscure comic-y reference)-- This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine - www.geekspeakmagazine.com",

    "reviewTitle": "What's better than a superhero movie? A movie with six superheroes of course! The Avengers, is a masterpiece!",
    "reviewBody": "Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), & Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well they do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) & Hawkeye under his control & leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only recently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she recruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to check the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these events took place in Captain America: The First Avenger) & woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years. After that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the team can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues & cut down their giant egos & work together as a team. Problematic? Yes! Iron Man's sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is hilarious! First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the superhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil & menacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The cinematography is brilliant. The way they've shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A note on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite character in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though he's the only villain in the movie he's pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill & Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit back & relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Don't miss this on the big screen no matter what people! Now, let's see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one. The bar has been set very high though!",

    "reviewTitle": "Finally, a Film that Lives Up to Its Hype and High Expectations!",
    "reviewBody": "The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some \"funny\" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a \"team\" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon.  Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.",

But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history. Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.",

    "reviewTitle": "Whedon's explosive comic-com' smashes the bullseye...",
    "reviewBody": "Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the flaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question: where exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through the roof? Well, guess what? He's only gone and pulled it off. Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the first Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of something (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers movie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a film's been coming since the early 1960's. And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert Downey-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didn't fancy this one but fear not, Hulk nuts, Ruffolo's twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and you're guaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it goes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson) to help save the world from Thor's bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if you thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing you've ever seen. Think again. Skilled sci-fi pen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster that's more than the sum of it's fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. It's incredible. It's thunderous. It's furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, let's get down to business.Whedon has approached this four-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development and chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another it's actually surprising. The sheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is saying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation of comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.Downey-Junior's effortlessly cool turn on the sarci' Stark was always going to be the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. It's not all about the billionaire ball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the out-of-touch Cap' chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddleston's creepy demigod makes for a sharp villain.Granted, Whedon's tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to measure up to any of Nolan's Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why there's not much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolan's Dark Knight rebirth. It's a kick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating affair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. It's an absolute blast. Wildly entertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers' is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud, exciting, electric and did I mention funny!? Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no. X-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Whedon's Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most entertaining. Definitely the coolest.Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the crap out of one and all. But you won't mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesn't get much better than this. Joss Whedon and co. have kicked this year's comic-book-busters off with a bang. Expect sequels.",

    "reviewTitle": "It was worth the wait!",
    "reviewBody": "Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted out to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and critically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\" (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than \"The Avengers\") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well.",
    "reviewBody": "Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word – Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well. Excellent 4/5",

    "reviewTitle": "The Most Awaited Movie Turns Out to be The Most Epic",
    "reviewBody": "I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome. In general, this movie was damn good. I wasn't bored, and I enjoyed every freaking moment.",

And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there. I was never the biggest fan of avengers, but right now, after writing these lines, I am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am.THIS is how you spend 200 million on a movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "Gloriously entertaining, and extremely well-balanced across its large cast of characters",
    "reviewBody": "Avengers (all right, \"Avengers Assemble\" if you insist) is really quite extraordinarily good. It's pretty much everything that's fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen - I was hoping for as much from Joss Whedon and he delivered.Like Serenity and the Buffy season 5 finale, it's extremely well-structured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes; I can't think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so well-balanced between them all, and all the different combinations of arguments and team-ups between them.It's also extremely funny (but *mostly* not in that trademark Joss Whedon \"Buffyspeak\" way that some VERY WRONG people find \"precious\" and annoying). It has better Tony Stark dialogue than either Iron Man movie! Having said that, the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the Hulk...I often complain that superhero films' weakest parts tend to be their climactic action sequences: the stakes are raised, and believability is strained. Well, for once we have a superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end. It's one of the best-sustained action finales since The Matrix - and much better-directed than the incomprehensible shots of The Dark Knight. It's constantly spectacular and contains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue - most of which also happen to be very funny.But the best *single scene* in the whole film isn't an action scene! A standard phrase Joss Whedon has used in promotional interviews is \"I wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other\". Well, that scene where they *are* all in the same room as each other turned out to be the film's absolute highlight. Scenes like that are what I'll look forward to on subsequent viewings. There have been lots of action films that I've enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re-watch because that they didn't have much else going for them (Avatar comes to mind) - but this isn't one of them.The film's plot isn't exactly intricate: it's extremely tightly focused around the MacGuffin from Thor and Captain America. However, this isn't a bad thing: in a film of this scale, ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as it is, without adding a complex twisty-turny plot to the mix as well.The film doesn't carry any sort of larger real-world message; it's really just a movie about these specific characters - about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other. But as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other go... well, it's hard to imagine how they could get much better.",

This movie has high expectations from almost everyone Released on 27April Friday Six days before the US release. The Marvel superheroes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are assembled by the S.H.I.E.L.D. Leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in order to prevent the expected war and fight the emerged Super Villain God of Mischief Loki (Tom Huddleston)! The Immortal Loki Planning a war and aiming Slavery on Earth, has to be defeated by this group of superheros called the Avengers. In order to achieve their target they have to Fight their Superhero Alter Ego and The clashes of their Ally's powers and control them to unify and Save the planet. Nick Fury convinces them all to join the Avengers Initiative ,which later leads to confusion brawl and Fights on the insideAll is taken lightly until the realization and attack on the Base which proves that the whole world is at stake. The Screenplay as well as the Storyline is Amazing, every scene handled with perfection. The Story is well explained and gives a break from the Action which keeps you In the Movie. The Cinematography is Awesome and Exceptional with the Direction and Special Effects Justifies the Storyboard and is Realistic...All the Action Sequences are well Coordinated, Engaging and with popping 3D effects well in place it's a treat to the eye. The Screen Space is shared equally and handled well between the Large Cast... About the Soundtrack it's Average, nothing Extraordinary or Provoking. The movie just misses out somewhere on the Emotions. The Previous releases have already made the Superheroes Familiar and this avoids much confusion. Well Edited and Brilliantly Adapted screenplay makes the most of the Storyline and even handles the major challenge that could have been faced of making Order of Chaos. The much Hyped movie has definitely met the expectations and is perfect blockbuster. Even watch it from some fresh Action from Hulk, Black Widow, and The Hawkeye who don't disappoint you at all. Mark Raffalo's performance and Character is noticeable out of all the other Star Superheroes. No doubt the best superhero movie this Decade. 3 time watch for Comic Superhero Movie fans. 2 time for Super Action Fans. And at least a onetime must watch for every other Hollywood Movie Buff out there.",

    "reviewTitle": "Joss Whedon Has Done It Right And Well",
    "reviewBody": "With the success of Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man' in 2008, calls started ringing out across the comic book universe for not only further comic book movies, but also for the 'The Holy Grail of Cinematic Superheroes,' which is also known as an 'Avengers' film. What followed was four more Marvel Universe movies, the introduction of many favoured and established characters and the continual teasing of fans across the globe with post-credit sequences. The introduction of Samuel L. Jackson as Commander Nick Fury inevitably announced to fans that an 'Avengers' movie would come to fruition and it brought forth the key question of when rather than where, who and why.The man tasked with throwing all these vibrant characters into a smouldering cauldron of excitement and pure unadulterated geekiness is one Joss Whedon. He's already created three incredibly successful television shows and an incredibly successful tie-in movie in 'Serenity,' but this is undoubtedly his biggest challenge to date. Today sees the release of 'The Avengers' (or 'Avengers Assemble' in the United Kingdom) across the globe, and while it contains evident flaws, it's nothing short of a two hour canonical ride across the Marvel Universe which provides everything to satisfy fans, nerds and casual cinema-goers alike.Buried deep beneath a Government facility is the mystical cube known as the tesseract. When it begins to mysteriously start operating by itself Commander Nick Fury, and his agents Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), unexpectedly come face-to-face with the Asgard deity Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The God is being seemingly controlled by a higher being, with but one simple, yet distinct aim, to control, enslave and destroy the Earth and humanity. With reluctance, Fury initiates the 'Avengers' protocol, which brings together the rag-tag team of superheroes consisting of: Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the Asgard God Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Clint 'Hawkeye' Barton (Jeremy Renner), the Black Widow Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and the unpredictable Dr Banner (Mark Ruffalo).Where 'The Avengers' had the ability to fall pretty darn hard was with the amount of material ready at hand. Joss Whedon could've potentially created a ten-hour-three-film epic without even scratching the surface of what drives these beings to do what they do. Instead, in the running time which extends to just over two hours, he's created an intimate and humanised portrayal of six individuals who may be Gods, geniuses, super-human beings and destructive radioactive experiments on the outside, but all reflect deep, inner trauma on the inside.The initial meetings between the characters show an element of distrust and reluctance. Why should one be subordinate to others when, by all accounts in their own minds, they all have the better technology, powers or intellect? With their flaws prominently on show from the beginning Whedon doesn't just show the audience superheroes, but he creates them before your own eyes. Building these characters from the inside, outside he allows the audience to empathise with their plights. After all, Thor is simply an Asgardian God with family issues, Dr Banner simply wants to be left alone in isolation to his own devices, and Black Widow and Hawkeye seem to battling those basic primal urges that come with humanity and prolonged friendship.But one character that does continually feel out of place is the antagonist of the piece, Loki. Despite Tom Hiddleston creating a superb maniacal villain with thespian traits who thrives on power and destruction, it's hard to shake-off the fact that Loki he is constantly being undermined by those pulling his puppeteering strings. Yet, this should not detract away from his performance which constantly steals the show whenever he is on-screen with other members of the Avengers initiative, and which can be partly attributed to Josh Whedon and Zak Penn's slick screenplay.The script contains some suspect writing in places, especially with regards to Dr Banner and some of the more unusually up-beat and intellectually void phrases he spouts. But aside from the odd sentence here or there, Whedon and Penn's script manages to combine the right mix or humour, bravado and arrogance allowing, not only each character's personality to thrive, but also the plot to be continually be driven forward. Whether it's the blossoming relationship between two prominent superheroes or the developing nature of the narrative, the film is never stagnant, and it's this plot development which gives Joss Whedon the ability to let his comic book geekdom roam free in the final act with an enthralling visual action-orientated conclusion.Starting in Manhattan, the action takes place on the ground, in the air, inside buildings and generally anywhere where there's an enough room to photograph a glorious all battle of good versus evil. Explosions saturate the air, but there's also an enjoyable emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, especially when the likes of Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America are left without their weapons. Beautifully choreographed, fast, frenetic and aesthetically pleasing the final thirty minutes are a fitting and welcome conclusion to an epic comic book movie. Joss Whedon hasn't only managed to finally bring the six glorious superheroes to the big-screen. But he's also also managed to do it well, very well.",

    "reviewTitle": "Totally Awevengersome",
    "reviewBody": "Just came back from watching The Avengers. Awesome , epic, cool, outstanding, fantastic etc. Looks like for almost the whole year of me waiting to watch movie and all the hype that they built up was worth the waitTom Hiddleston as Loki is as evil as ever but it would have been great if more villains had shown up along the way. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye was the surprising character for me since I never expected him to turn evil but he was definitely the right man chosen for the role. Scarlett Johansson was beautifully stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Thor was great and surprisingly gave The Hulk a run for his money (something which I didn't quite expect to see). Speaking of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo was well suited to play Bruce Banner/Hulk (although Norton was better in my opinion). Cobie Smulders as Maria Hills was a bit of a let down since I expected more screen time for her. Samuel L. Jackson was OK as Nick Fury. Robert Downey Jr. is as goofy as ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man but for me the biggest driving force of the entire movie has got to none other than Chris Evan's awesome acting as Steve Rogers/Captain America. He was in my opinion the biggest star of the film in my opinion and really made the team come together as one. The plot was very simple and straightforward but the action scenes and dram was what made the movie really interesting. Who says that the movie needs to have a good storyline in order for the film to be great. The movie itself doesn't necessary require story background for the characters at all since they were all already told in their own separate movies respectivelyOn a note to those who have been complaining on the film for being mindless boring etc. My question is, what did you expect from a superhero movie? This movie is all about action and it was made to be entertaining and fun to watch, not for you to sit and expect a twisty kind of turn story like TDK. The main reason why people go watch is because they wanted to see their favorite main heroes from different franchise team up together in the same movie. Thats all that is and to me, that isn't a bad thing at allI have a degree in film and video (majoring animation if you're wondering) but I still find this movie really good. If you guys are looking for something else beyond action in this film, then you guys are in the wrong place All in all, an epic film which definitely deserves to be ranked in the IMDb top 100 movie list and definitely above TDK. This is one movie which I will surely go and see againOn A Final Note :- KUDOS TO JOSS WHEDON AND THE ENTIRE CREW FOR MAKING AN AWESOME SUPERHERO FILM. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE AVENGERS 2",

Mindblowing, fantastic, thrilling, funny, excellent, Marvel has done something no one else have ever done before, putting together all these different superheroes, in one fantastic franchise, and making it work wonderfully! It might seen a little \"over-powered\" but the feeling you get, watching all of these personalities fight together, makes it work. Marvel have actually made me do something I've never done before, write a review (kind of) on IMDb, and you have got to deliver for me to do that kind of things. Just the best movie I've ever seen 10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "An amazing star-cast, well-paced direction and a brilliant story !!!",
    "reviewBody": "\"Amazing\", would be a one word review for this movie!I went on to the cinema yesterday and was excited enough to have watched the trailers more than 30 to 40 times and was thinking, how would Marvel / Joss Whedon contain any of these characters in such a short story (last for about 142 min) when each of them were brilliant enough to grip me in 130-150 minutes of their own (in Iron Man 1 & 2, Thor, Captain America). But Mr. Whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territory.This has to be the best superhero movie till date. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man / Stark) has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is, well, strong and manly, Chris Evans (Captain America) has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and a surprise, Hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too, for a delightful change. I really think Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk) is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of a movie.I delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 (I hope there was a 11 possible) for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster, without a break!!!Watch it, if you want to know how Superhero movies should be!",

    "reviewBody": "I went into this movie with very high expectations cause I watched all the trailers about 30 times each. I will say from the very first 10 minutes of the films I was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story. All the characters in this film get an equal amount of screen time, which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with multiple characters such as in this film. I applaud Joss Whedon for making this Marvel Masterpiece, the way everything fits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story. Mr Whedon was the perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as he's a comic book fan, he nailed it 100%. I believe i'm going to see this film again tomorrow, it is just that awesome. Hulk will give you a fun time in this film, watch out!",

    "reviewTitle": "Well Worth the Wait!",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers or Marvel's Avengers Assemble here in the UK for ridiculous reasons is the long awaited teaming up of the characters from Marvel's recent and successful movies. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and steals The Tesseract, an energy source being worked on by scientists at S.H.I.E.L.D. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative and assembles a team of superhuman men and women that comprises of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who join S.H.I.E.L.D Agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in attempting to stop Loki from subjugating the world's population.There was always the danger that things could go 'tits up' for Marvel when producing a film on this scale and with so many well known characters and actors/personalities involved. I'm delighted to say that they have pulled it off and that The Avengers is a terrific film. The plot itself plays second fiddle to the assembling of the team and I don't think this was a bad thing. Obviously Marvel will be hoping for a sequel or five to come after the film so it was essential that the characters interactions and developments with each other were given high priority. The sharp dialogue is thrown between the characters with more force and precision than a throw of Thor's hammer. In the end the story is similar to every other superhero movie; bad guy brings destructive forces to Earth in an attempt to rule and/or destroy humanity while superhero(s) attempt to stop them. In Loki and Tom Hiddleston though, there is a bad guy who carries great menace and feels more dangerous when he is doing nothing than when he is thrashing his weapon around. I think that Hiddleston gives the best performance of the piece.The time given to each character seemed fair and worked well. There was a risk that this could have turned into Iron Man 3 plus Other Guys and as you'd expect given his character traits, Downey Jr does get more dialogue than the others but not so much that he overpowers the film. Captain America becomes the de-faco leader of The Avengers, Thor has a vested interest in bringing Loki to justice and while I'd like to have seen more of Dr. Banner, the Hulk had the best action scenes and also the biggest laugh of the entire film. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Sam Jackson also have plenty to do. It is testament to how good the film is that there are no characters who feel forgotten or underused.I've said in the past that I wish action blockbusters would be more fun. They always seem so straight and serious (i.e. Battleship), but The Avengers is the most fun film I've seen in a long time. The action was frenetic and thankfully avoided too much shaky-cam so I was able to keep up with it. It is also one of the funniest films I've seen for a few weeks. Marvel's films always have humour intrinsically wound into them but never before has there been so much and that it's hit the mark so often. I can't think of a big Hollywood movie that has made me laugh this much so far in 2012.As well as being action packed and fun, the movie also looks incredible. I saw it in 2D (and wont go on a rant as to why, but basically I'm sick of crummy, dark, 3D) and it still popped off the screen. Highlights included the fantastic and believable technology used aboard S.H.I.E.L.D's ship and most spectacularly of all, the giant Centipede like bad guys who looked phenomenal. The sight of them ripping through New York City is something that will stay with me. The main character's design and costume were all excellent. Iron Man looked even cooler when covered in dents and scratches and The Hulk's design is far improved from his Edward Norton days. For me the best costume though was Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow outfit because of.. um.. well.. the.. the colour's nice. Yes the colour.My only complaints are mild and that is that the horde of alien bad guys didn't really do much. It was only really numbers that they had on their side. Another small problem I had was trying to remember where everyone fitted as I've only seen each of the lead-up films once so couldn't quite place some people, words and ideas. Those though are extremely pernickety and minor problems.Overall The Avengers is one of the most entertaining films I've seen in years and at the end of the day we go to the cinema to be entertained so what more can I add? Only that this film has become greater than the sum of its parts.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

It is as good a superhero movie as there can be,,,,,, it is an emotional,hilarious(=Robert Downey Jr.), and action packed superhero movie....As far as acting goes.. its an absolute knockout by all the actorsRobert Downey Jr.----> 10/10(Executed the best lines in the best possible way or should we say his natural way)Chris Evans----> 8/10Mark Ruffalo--->10/10(Probably the most cool minded and seemingly not partially mentally impaired,Bruce banners unlike others portrayed)Chris Hemsworth----> 8/10(good physique yet again, apt for a demigod)Scarlett Johansson---->9/10(Served Hot and dangerous)Jeremy Renner---->9/10Tom Hiddleston---->10/10(It takes some really good acting to portray the god of mischief, really seemed to play with their minds)Samuel L. Jackson---->10/10(Good as always)The writing was great with some really good dialogues with punchTwo of the most outstanding scenes of the movie are towards the end, first when Iron Man gets into his new Mach7 IRON MAN suit in a free fall after being thrown down by Loki,And secondly when Loki was boosting about him being a demigod in front of Hulk who breaks his trash talk & him too, just grabbing him & giving good old bash to the ground(\"dhobi pachad\") to knock him out....(this is a must watch scene)also is the scene where Hulk stops the first big monster,,,,OVERALL 10/10(Considering it a Superhero movie, it is the best there is now)This movie has got style if not anything else.......so this is a must watch movie & if you don't, well you have certainly missed one,,,,,,",

I thoroughly recommend this film, it captured the true meaning of an epic feature and this certainly delivers a punch! The Hulk looked great in all his glory and I hope he gets to appear in the next instalment! A great mix of action from the air battles to the streets below. It was great seeing Thor and Hulk battle it out again being the last time we saw them together was in TIHR TV movie from 1988!I think it was faithful to the comics and brought the comic strip to life and I can only applaud the efforts of the film crew for bringing together the characters that I grew up and became so fond of.",

    "reviewBody": "Avengers..!! It would be perfect to describe this movie as nothing short of awesomeness.It's a pleasure to all the senses.!It's a kind of movie for which large screens were built i.e to provide full of entertainment..n avenges is full of promise.. The story line is simple..Earth is in danger,with otherworldly creatures having waged war.Led by Loki, the Norse God and Avenger Thor's half- brother, an army called the Chikauri attack the human race. In their way stand superheroes — each as formidable as the other, each dealing with his/her demons, and with each other. The way Joss Whedon handled the cast is impressive..none of the superhero felt left behind..and his direction is at top notch.. Coming to the cast Robert Downey Junior is impressive..he can be termed as \"The Jack Sparrow\" of the avengers with his cheeky lines.. Chris Evans,Chris Hemsworth,Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are impressive..but the biggest surprise is Mark Rufallo as the Dr.Bruce Banner a.k.a the Hulk(\"the other guy\")..he Delivers probably the best scenes in the movie and oh boy he steals the show big time..!! never enjoyed anything on big screen as him(The Hulk)..coming to the others Tom Hiddleston is good as a much formidable opponent to the group of superheroes, slimy and evil in equal measure. Samuel L Jackson is efficient well supported by Cobbie Smulders.. In the end to sum up The Avengers is a treat to watch..don't miss it..",

Joss Whedon takes four different visions of directors and makes it his own. This is the ultimate pay off for marvel's five years of planning and hard work. The team dynamics Whedon captured perfectly in \"firefly\" are in full display here. Every person has motive and a relation with the other. Special mention to the HULK. You literally don't see anything when he is on the scree. This is the peak of entertainment. The stunning action, the witty dialog makes it irresistible.Avengers makes it fun to be a geek. If you like intelligent humor, thrilling story and larger than life action in your movie, then Avengers is for you. There were claps, cheers and shouts all around in the cinema. In this day when you think you have seen it all, that's an achievement in itself. How I wish it were 3 hrs long. Don't miss it!",

    "reviewBody": "It was a spectacular experience watching this movie in 3D. Without the 3D effects it will only be a still those who love epic action movies. Movie starts off with a very slow pace and then it gathers speed since the entry of iron man.This movie has a large number of academy awards nominees. Robert Downey Jr; Gwyneth Paltrow; Samuel L Jackson; Jeremy Renner; Mark Ruffalo etc.It is Robert Downey Jr's movie indeed. He delivered a spectacular performance as a guy who can't help but to tell wits in each and every sentence he says. Th audience loved watching Iron man in action. I was happy with entry of Gwyneth Paltrow as well.Mark Ruffalo managed to stick to his own personal standard as well. He portrays a man who is very caring, soft and tender but later turns out to be someone who is disastrous to the environment, when he gets angry. Scarlett Johanssen shined well in this film. She was very flexible in action as well as acting. Her addition made this movie much more thrilling. She look very cool with curled red hair. It is definitely one of her best looks since Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth too was good.Chris Evans looked a lot different from his earlier films. He managed deliver the maturity his character Captain America needed.The whole film had a lot of visual effects. The 3d effects mad the movie look more attractive. one can definitely go for the film to look for their favorite super hero. Definitely the fans of Iron man will love the film.8/10",

Really often we see top 1000 voters who presses a movie down - by giving bad votes. Once in a while, some of the old movies are ready to get out of the top 250 list. They have to accept that. The project to get the Avengers together, has been done in an excellent way - bravo. I was not sure, what to get - because so many heroes should work together. Would someone steal the limelight? And would it be 80% Iron Man, and 20% Avengers? No, its is pure 100% Avengers. Thank you.",

    "reviewTitle": "Spoiler-Free review of an Awesome flick!",
    "reviewBody": "The movie touches on all bases that a good super-hero / fantasy movie should. A fantastic story line, solid action, good humor, and amazing visuals.The story is a bit much, kinda out-there (literally) but it is in keeping with the nature of the Thor / Asgard storyline. You cant include a Norse God without accepting some magik / fantasy elements. Plus the Avengers always tackled those issues in the books. Even the pacing was right on; at no point does it get slow or bogged down in exposition. Bottom line: it works.The action is solid on all levels, and some of it is just breathtaking. Even the face-offs are surprising, and fun to watch. Best action in a superhero movie period.The humor / emotion: the movie is hilarious without being stupid or directed at 8-year olds. Lucas / DC Comics take note! You don't have to make lame, childish jokes to be funny. Think more Joker with the pencil than anything in Green Lantern. Downey Jr is the driving force of this movie, and his Stark is turned up a notch. There a some literal laugh-out-loud moments in there, and some moments where the theater became deathly still. They pull strings without making you feel like a puppet.Finally, visually the movie looks amazing. ILM outdid themselves, and the one spot I'm sure everyone was worried about, the green one, just looks sick. Not a lot of shake-the-camera fake action, but some great scenes, even a few surprising choices of vantage points.The cast was perfect, Ruffalo IS Banner. A throwback to the Bixby days, instantly making you forget Norton or Bana. Evans owns the Cap / Leader / Good Guy role. You want to follow him. Johannson is a bad-ass in her role, Hemsworth is good, although Thor is kinda one-note. Hawkeye is an intriguing character, and Renner has the same great smirky tension he had in Hurt Locker. Agent Coulson has a much-expanded role in this, and his parts are special in themselves. And of course, Downey is king.Im not a huge Avengers fan, never was. X-Men or The Justice League were always my favorites, so I'm not total fanboy, but I think this movie captured every element a true comic fan would want to see on the screen, and casual fans can just enjoy it as well, because it stands alone as a great movie. Probably the best since First Class, maybe the best since Dark Knight. I know I walked out feeling like I did after Return Of The King. It's that good!",

    "reviewBody": "I rarely review any movie titles, purely because I watch so many films it would be impossible to review them all. Avengers Assemble however was a special case.I not only rate this as the best comic book movie ever crafted, but also as one of the best films ever made. It had heart, comedy, action, animation, character development, suspense; all neatly encompassed in a smooth and flawlessly flowing Joss Whedon storyline.Each character has his/her moment of glory and not one of the actors/actresses feel short of the high expectations placed upon their shoulders. Chris Evans as Captain America is and always will be my favourite character in this Marvel film series and he shined brighter than ever in his second role reprisal.I cannot more highly insist you see this film whilst it is IN THE CINEMAS! In 3D if you possibly can as it adds depth and en-chances the CGI (especially on the tanked body of The Hulk and the none CGI behind of Miss. Scarlett).The Avengers Assembled in perfect form, lets bring on the next one!",

Jackson,Gwyneth Paltrow 142 min - Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi | Superhero Suitable: PG-13VEpic movie!!!! I don't know from where to start...I mean this movie is the mother of all the entertainment which you can ever ask for! A movie which has produced what it was promised when it was under the production. 143 minutes of breathtaking experience and definitely a movie like this can be produced once in a life time. I don't know when was the last time I saw a movie in 3D but I am glad my experience of watching this movie will live for a long time. Lots of memories are now related to this movie! Excellent direction, I mean handling all these superheros, boy, that takes a great talent! However, in my personal opinion Hulk was the best then Iron Man! Special effects not to mention was top class..3D effects were also superb BUT try to watch without 3D!!! Excellent editing, great script and brilliant dialogues specially the punch lines. I can go on writing about this movie because its just \"AWESOME\". My final verdict \"DONT MISS THIS ONE\" !!!STORYLINENick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.Can find @ \"GO AND WATCH IN ANY CINEMA NEAR YOU\"More reviews @ https://www.facebook.com/unitedcbaMR Copyright ©2012 ~unitedcba.

    "reviewBody": "Avengers is a great movie with awesome action, and a story that is simple enough to follow. It doesn't matter if you have seen earlier MARVEL movies or not, although if you have seen them it will provide great character depth. Each character gets its own moments - both physically and emotionally, but quick witted on liners by Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) and awesome action pieces by Hulk steals the show. Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has his moments to as major super villain. The movie has humor, and all in the right places. The screenplay, dialogues and dialogue delivery is very good and action pieces are the kind that you have never scene before, especially in last half hour.This movie is EPIC.In short, it a movie that you should not miss and if you do you will regret it later. WELL DONE JOSS WHEDON !!",

I have been an avenger ever since I was 16 and was reading my first comic although I was a marvel fan WELL before that.... so I have been waiting for this movie for a good 11 years!!!Avengers Assemble is near enough the perfect movie and Marvel have finally done the unthinkable and ousted The Dark Knight as greatest comic book movie (and actually greatest movie of all time!) Joss Whedon as Director put tingles down my spine as I am a major Buffy and Angel fan in addition to him writing the greatest X Men Story of all time (Astonishing X Men) I knew we was in excellent hands!If there are 2 minor criticms of this movie it would be these: 1: Maria Hill by Cobie Smulders... Im a major fan of HIMYM and her character Robin Schebatsky and miss smulders is a major crush of mine however they made Maria Hill into your carbon copy standard issue agent! If this was going to be the way no need for her to be so heavily featured in the advertising...2: The Battle Cry isn't actually screamed out in the movieDespite these 2 oversights it simply is the greatest movie of all time!10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "So good!",
    "reviewBody": "I suppose the question on your lips is 'Any Good?'The short answer is 'yes'.The longer answer is 'F**k me silly, that film was awesome!'The even longer answer is:Joss Whedon has created a witty, entertaining superhero that more than capably juggles different characters and threads all together into an unsubtle, but solid film.It helps if you've seen the previous Marvel Studio films in the franchise before seeing this. I had personally seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor although I had not seen The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton and I had a good idea of the principal characters and what was going on. There is the barest bones of back-story for each of the heroes but the majority of exposition is around the character of Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).Speaking of which, Mark Ruffalo somehow steals the show as the Hulk, utterly removing the previously uninspiring film adaptations. He is amazing, in every way. Bruce Banner gets some quality lines and Mark Ruffalo delivers in pretty much every way, it is a lot more of a subtle performance than most of his fellow actors, who are much more brazen, brash and forward.Robert Downey Jr once again delivers as Iron Man, a character that is as rich and as interesting two films down the line as he ever was. He gets the best lines and even though it takes a little bit of time to introduce Iron Man compared to some of the other characters, he sticks in the mind and has his own standouts moments alongside the rest of the Avengers.Captain America (Chris Evans) is also on top form as Captain America, a character I was initially concerned would not fit well into the dynamic of the group but his character fits really nicely.As a personal favourite, it is always nice to see Loki on the screen. His 'little brother' syndrome makes his a fascinating villain in Thor and Tom Hiddleston absolutely proves he is brilliant as this twisted, powerful trickster. In Loki, once again, Marvel Studios provide a villain that is as well fleshed out and as interesting as the heroes. I've already mentioned Josh Whedon's outlandish ability to fuse together so many characters into a film well. When all the Avengers have assembled, each character and their traits clash in a....realistic way, the selfless with the arrogant etc etc. Whilst the film does try extremely hard to have as many Avenger on Avengers fights as possible and they are thrilling, seeing them work together as a team is frankly fantastic. Again, several stunning shots pan seamlessly from one character to the next, cutting through the large amounts of chaotic action to deliver what you wanted to see, superheroes beating on things.Another key Whedon-ish (tm) is the humour. It is a pretty funny film too boot.Its $220 million budget went a long way too. Apart from the actors and the not inconsiderable sums of money they would have been paid, the CGI is almost faultless. It is awesome, and always seems to make the events feel like a comic book. Again, the standout being a very realistic, physical Hulk. The best incarnation yet, for sure. It's not without fault:The plot is nonsense. The script is sometimes clunky and awkward.It is a long film (although doesn't really feel like it)However, these are mere grains of sand on a beach of AWESOMNESS.Watch this film!9/10 easy.",

    "reviewTitle": "In a classroom, \"The Avengers\" is definitely an \"A\" student but not necessarily the brightest or the most creative.",
    "reviewBody": "If you are a fan of any of the marvel characters in the movie, like myself, you will not be disappointed. You will exactly see what you have expected it to be in full length since the release of its trailer, no more, no less.Every superhero gets ample screen time and their interactions with one another is pleasantly entertaining.The surprise here is the Hulk, whom I think is far more fun to watch here than in his own movies. Accolades to Ruffalo, who did a great job with Banner. (I'm not sure if he can be as good as Ed Norton in a standalone but as part of an ensemble, he's perfect and I can't say the same with Ed Norton if he is to reprise his role here.) The CGI version of this Hulk is also way better than his previous versions - rightly proportioned, just the right tone of green and with an improved face that looks just like the comic version and even a bit like Ruffalo's. Simply awesome!My gripe(s) with the movie though is with its overly simple and uninteresting main plot. Tom Hiddleston is a charming lad but alas, Loki as the lone villain against such a powerful team is simply too weak and a non-threat. Throughout the movie, I never quite felt that anyone (except perhaps Loki himself) was in any kind of serious Jeopardy. Btw, speaking of weak enemies, how about an alien army (more like a skirmish team) on hover-boards? Hmm....looks familiar....don't they work for Skeletor? Perhaps that's what the whole portal thing was about. Together, it feels just like a plot-line pulled from an episode of \"He-man and the Masters of the Universe\". Also, if the alien mother-ship can be so easily destroyed, who needs the avengers? Just launch a few nuclear missiles at it as it comes through the portal, duh!Aside from that, there really isn't much else to complain, especially with the understanding that this movie serves as an introductory episode in the forming of the team more than anything. Walking out the theater, I wanted to see more, and agree with Joss Whedon when he said the sequel(s) will be smaller in scale. By that, I hope he means only the amount of CGI shots, not what is at stake or the magnitude of the catastrophe/adversary the avengers has to face, since the team bonding/friction seems to be the true strength of the franchise. (Leave a big chunk of exploding machines and collapsing skyscrapers to other movies please, since we have probably all seen enough of that by now.) Besides that, it also needs to be cleverer and more emotionally engaging. It will then be perfect.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers is worth it!",
    "reviewBody": "Where to begin?! The Avengers is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force. From a fan's point of view, the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books which were not previously filmed. From my point of view, a non-fanatic yet sucked into the hype,I had the inclination to watch those movies, which I hadn't watched yet, with the superheroes in the Avengers and trust me it was worth it! Apart from the fact that a viewer would not know a particular superhero's past, there is a minute back story which is worth noting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in The Avengers.Casting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which Cobie Smulders (some of you may know her as Robin from \"How I Met Your Mother\") played, though small, were significant. Screenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had a USP of 3D motion picture, the effect changed the experience.Action is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies, as not all fights are against 'the bad guy' in particular, it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win, but how? Comedy, interestingly, was present, I feel mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. but others were important factors.This movie was not very dialogue-heavy but more straight to the point. Script-wise, the dialogues were indeed effective as well as pulsating for the the viewer.With an approx 2hr 30min running time, there are hardly any parts which one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as a one-time-watch there are particular scenes which really make you look for them on Youtube and such.With bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of adrenaline in more than just a couple of scenes, The Avengers took me by surprise, and I hope it does the same to you.P.S. I saw the ranking being extremely high, an 8.9 on IMDb, before viewing it and now I can see why it was so high.",

    "reviewBody": "The Avengers is the best summer blockbuster for a long time, it balances all elements of fun, drama, action, special effects, multiple egos into a well directed, paced movie. The film has perfectly edited action set pieces, no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely. The first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up, but after that the last hour especially is amazing. Credit has to go to the director, you really can tell he has a love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film. The drama is not as dark as say the dark knight. As people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments. The Avengers is simply amazing, Hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come, The Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man, Skyfall, The Hobbit. The Avengers has started the summer blockbuster season with a bang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012. I highly recommend the Avengers.",

    "reviewTitle": "Quite possibly the best comic adaptation I have ever seen.",
    "reviewBody": "I am a HUGE Marvel fan. While I haven't read most of the comics in years I still enjoy the characters. Stan lee is a genius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and NOT be a poor, bad acted, cheesy, knock off. This movie, says it all. It shows everyone exactly why they love these comics. And that is simply that we can all be more than the sum of what we are, or perceive ourselves to be. The prior movies are also very close to my heart. Iron man sold me on Robert Downing Jr. again as an actor and someone who can rise above. RDJ personifies Iron Man perfectly, there is no other actor that could ever come close. The turmoil he has in this movie, the battle between his ego and doing what is right despite personal loss is, well, it's a work of pure art. Chris Hemsworth once again shows the world that a man can play a god. He does it with grace and strength, and with my humble opinion; a human element, knowing that while he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically (except Hulk) he is also weak. He gives a character that could have easily have been a \"I am better than you because I am a god\" a sense of humanity and humility. Thor is a protector of earth, and he protects her with a fierce resolve. Mark Ruffalo, while I was a bit disappointed that Ed Norton would not be playing Hulk, I was happy and thrilled with the choice. Mr. Ruffalo shows all aspects of the Hulk with smooth, fluid motion. The anger he has to contain, the control he has, he should teach a class on anger management. He shows what I believe to be a true Hulk. The human that fights the beast within. Who among us can say we don't have a little of that in us? Chris Evans, he was the Torch, a cocky, show off that loved the lime light. I was worried about him being a soldier, THE soldier. When I saw Captain America I was blown away by his scope. Something he continues to bring to this movie. He portrays The Captain as a soldier, a soldier out of time. And yet he is quick to adapt, and lead a group of people that you wouldn't imagine could be a team. He honors Captain America with his portrayal of him. Jeremy Renner, I haven't seen many of his movies, but the ones I have I have enjoyed immensely. He took a character that could have easily been just a side note and made him shine. Showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin. I truly hope that we get to see a solo act for him, I think it would be worth it. Scarlett Johansson continues to portray The Black Widow with skill and grace. She is beautiful and deadly, the perfect Black Widow. Maybe a movie with her and Jeremy Renner? Something to think about. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was inspired. And in this film you actually get to see more than just Nick Fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out. He shows that Nick Fury is a bad ass to be reckoned with. Even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong. Clark Gregg, aka Agent Coulson, I will tell you the truth here, I thought he was nothing more than a filler, but he nearly stole the show for me. He did an incredible job, and has in all of these films. He shows an agent that is direct and very much a \"man in black\", but then you find that he, well, he has the biggest heart. And he delivers it with a fantastic dry wit. The entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise, and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down in the face of impending death, but will fight it until there is no more of us.The last person I want to mention is Joss Whedon. I LOVE this genius, this man who can seamlessly put danger, action, and humor together. He did it with Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. I admire his work to the point that I will watch anything, and everything of his. He was the perfect choice for this, and I can' wait to see what he comes up with next.The overview of this movie is simply, words can no do it justice. It was not just a movie, it was truly an experience. You are sucked into the story, shown by so many different aspects. I have been disappointed with some of the comic movies, X-men:Final Stand, comes to mind (someone please tell me, WHERE in the X-men comics did Charles die? Last I checked he didn't). And with those disappointments comes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to it's hype. I was thrilled that not only did The Avengers, live up to its hype. It surpassed it. I have only one humble request, that the next one have Spider-man, and Wolverine. I recommend this movie to everyone, as it is the personification of why we go to movies, and why this business is a multi-billion dollar one. That we all need to escape our tired lives for a little while and be swept away to a world where, just for two hours, everything makes sense. The bad guys always lose, and the good guys win, with style. :)",

    "reviewBody": "While this is a perfectly decent movie, it certainly is not the 10 out of 10 some people seem to think it is worthy of, a victim of the over hyped build up by the studio maybe. To be frank, I found all the Avengers themselves lived up to expectations, but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore. The truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited, no matter how well they play their roles. The Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the super hero genre(so far) and the Avengers doesn't come close. Sorry guys I know I will have offended a few Marvel Maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves, The Dark Knight is one of the best films of all time, the Avangers is not, plain and simple. Worth watching but not worth the wait. Iron Man/Captain America are at least equally as good in their own right.",

One of the two things I was scared of is if the movie would give equal importance to all the characters(since this one has a lot of characters)meaning some characters get under played and others get more time on the screen but that never happened. The movie was well paced as well.Another thing that I was skeptical about is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, I was kind of hoping that Ed Norton would do the character but that did not happen. Never the less Mark did do a good job.So for me it was a 7.5 but I cannot give a 7.5 on rating so since the movie was good I gave it 8.You for sure can go and see the movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's no Dark Knight but it sits comfortably at the number 2 spot.",
    "reviewBody": "There isn't really much plot going on here but what there is plenty of is character depth, Joss Whedon does a fantastic job of giving these characters so many levels that we never knew they had. This added depth to the characters really causes us too feel for them in their moment of hardships. The character I ended up empathising for the most was actually Black Widow which actually surprised me a great deal. But that's thing that Whedon does really well, he is used to developing characters and yet again his fantastic writing does it again here. Now if you had your doubts about Joss Whedon's directing ability then let me reassure you that you can put those fears to bed. Some of the shots he creates are absolutely stunning making for what will be some very iconic scenes from the movie. Not only did Joss Whedon direct this action filled roller coaster he also put pen to paper and wrote it, as I said the plot isn't exceptional but the dialogue is utter brilliance. Every word out of Tony Stark's mouth is absolutely hilarious making this funnier than a lot of comedies I have seen.Everyone knows the standard of the acting that is typically found in these Marvel movies, it's pretty good but nothing really amazing. Robert Downey Jr. obviously returns as the obnoxious and downright funny billionaire, Tony Stark. Everyone has seen this role before so you don't really see anything new here but you know what, that doesn't mean it hasn't gotten old. As usual Robert Downey Jr. performs brilliantly, displaying one of the best performances of the movie adding some comedy to an otherwise action filed adventure.Downey Jr. isn't the only one that shines here, Mark Ruffalo – who I am a huge fan of – plays Bruce Banner/ the Hulk brilliantly making for my personal favourite Hulk's we have seen to date and there is nothing I wish more than for him to get his own movie after this, but we all know that isn't going to happen. Ruffalo also supplies us with many laughs throughout the movie and he also gives us a collection of the best action sequences in the whole movie with his \"Hulk smash!\"We see the return of Tom Hiddleston as the menacing Loki and he plays the role absolutely beautifully. The first shot we get of Loki is harrowing which is mastered by the combination of Hiddleston's devilish performance and Whedon's gorgeous directing. Loki not only makes for a horrifying villain but his chemistry between Downey Jr. as Iron Man is priceless. If you weren't fond of Loki in Thor – like I wasn't – your mind will be changed here he truly is an evil person making for an iconic villain.Chris Evans and Hemsworth show us the performance you expect from seeing them in their individual Marvel movies, they aren't show stopping but are good enough for this movie. I feel as though the best moments of acting are when all of the Avengers are together, the chemistry between them is perfect, they all have their own different relationship between each other that can swap from hatred to best friends in a matter of minutes.Now the one thing that you don't have to worry about in this movie is any of the main characters being pushed aside. When I first saw the trailer I thought that this will end up being Iron Man & Co. but trust me it isn't, all of the characters you want to get all the screen time they deserve. Maria Hill played by the brilliant Cobie Smulders is one of the very few characters that gets pushed to the side, but she was never really regarded as one of the main characters although I would have liked it if she had a bit more ass kicking to do. Pepper Potts played by Gwyneth Paltrow makes a brief appearance which literally lasts a minute but you don't really care about that as this movie really isn't about her.The Avengers isn't exactly perfect, there was one thing I wasn't too fond of and that is that these movies are starting to feel far too familiar. Apart from the stature of this movie in comparison with others it doesn't really vary it's self from the other Marvel movies – Paramount Pictures – the direction has the same old comic book action style which you can spot in all the other movies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I can see many people starting to tire of it.I feel as though it is usually useless and extremely overpriced, the same can be said here. I didn't feel as though the 3D was necessary, if it was it would have been filmed in 3D and not post converted like most films are these day. The 3D wasn't used like Avatar to fully engross me in the world, it just felt like it was there and there was nothing really too it, I know I would have enjoyed the film just as much in 2D.The thing The Avengers does best is what it set out to do. It isn't trying to be a dark superhero movie with a serious tone – like The Dark Knight – and that's good because trying to compete with that is a ridiculous thing to do. The Avengers tries to be a comic book action-filled, Hollywood blockbuster and you know what it does that perfectly.Trust me, if you are a fan of superhero movies then you will fall in love with this movie, it is the movie we all wanted and expected, Joss Whedon has done us all proud and for that I would like to him, thank you very much. This is the perfect start to a Summer filled with brilliant movies.If you enjoyed you can check out many more at: http://moviesoclock.wordpress.com/",

I had never heard of the director, Joss, until this film was made and to be honest looking through his film history i was having some doubts. Which i now take back, he has done a amazing job, He gives each character all the amount of time they deserve, He created intense and epic battles and very humorous moments to top it off.To cut a long story short, this movie is amazing not perfect but amazing and it is a must see no matter what whether you are a comic book fan or not.",

    "reviewBody": "I am from India so I don't have much of the comic book reading experience which others from US have. But I've been waiting for this movie for over an year now. I have read so many reviews and saw so many Trailers of this movie before actually going to the movie I felt like I watched 90% of the movie. But when I actually saw this movie it blew me away. First and Foremost kudos to Whedon for a wonderful masterpiece. Screenplay was extra ordinary and the way he put all those powerful characters in one frame was simple brilliant. I don't know why but I always thought Iron Man will be like the central character of the movie. But it was great to see HULK made a big impact than any other character. I saw the UK Press conference where Mark Ruffalo said that he was the first person to act both Bruce and Hulk. It was simply amazing. I have never seen such a huge audience and rush for a English movie in so long after Avatar than I've seen today. If you haven't watched it yet. Do not waste any time. These type of movies come only once in a lifetime.",

To understand this movie I think that is entirely wrong.Yes to me watching them would make the movie a bit more understandable but not as much as others imply.As long as you know who iron man, Thor, hulk, captain America and the other casts are you should find the movie just as amazing as I did. Even at that without the knowledge of the other casts just knowing those 4 characters would be enough to find the movie entertaining.",

U hardly ever experience audience cheering and applauding in a cinema,but this exactly what happened when I was watching this film.So don't wait for this to come out on DVD or blue ray coz' u gotta watch this on a big screen and get lost in this along with others in the cinema. No doubt that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made,right up there with The dark Knight!",

The acting was OK and the actors really brought these characters to life. The CGI was seamless and eye-wateringly good. It was absolutely enthralling for any age group. A visual feast for the eyes. Highly recommend you go and see it as soon as possible. I will be going again this weekend. My 11 year old son said it was the best film he'd ever seen and he's not far off the mark. Of course, it was left open for a sequel and I cannot wait. Will the new Spider-man join them? I certainly hope so!",

This is how transformers saga should have been, all that beautiful CGI, eye candy pleaser, mixed with some genuine well written script, wonderful acting and a very well character development. Thou some characters shine a little more than others, everyone are given their share of screen time, it doesn't feel rushed, it doesn't feel forced, all scenes feel natural, and very well deserved to be in.You get to know the history about some characters like black widow, and hawkeye , and it remove all doubts about them being implemented in the team, everyone needs everybody in order to succeed. As i said before, avengers is transformers, without the sucky part, no one can say its another cgi fest, cause its an excellent movie.As to my favorite superheroe movie, i have to say dark knight still is, cause the story was a little better, but avengers is following closely as second spot surelly. Just have to wait and see how dark knight rises perform.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers - a ,,SMASH,, success ( Minor Spoilers! )",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers have been Assembled, and with great success. Marvel did all the forework flawlessly, all the Superhero movies leading to this 1 make sense now, small bits in those movies are directly or indirectly tied to this one. The Director / Writer: Joss Whedon - did a great job with all the characters, he took some bits out of the old movies and connected the dots, brought out the best in each and all of the characters. The Cast: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) - he was / is and will be the best choice to play IronMan, he just takes the character to a new level. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) - was great in Captain America, is absolutely great in this one, i feel like he can play any superhero, he is just the superhero ,,type,, I liked the old costume a bit better but this does not stop the Cap. being the Cap. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - The God of Thunder...what about that, he feels like the God of Thunder this time, his swing got meaner ( since his ,,Solo Movie,, ) and he swings a lot. Hulk/Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) - The unstoppable Force / the Green Rage Monster - oh my: what can i say here - Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK, he ties the absolute HULK: TV's Lou Ferrigno, who gives his voice to the big guy this time ( as he did in all HULK ,,Solo,, movies ). CGI work on HULK is absolutely Fantastic. I feel that Ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor Banner better than the others before him ( Eric Bana / Edward Norton ) and this time THE HULK can SMAAAASH ( 4 real ). Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a nice addition to the Avengers Team ( he had a short appearance in THOR before ), i feel that he is a bit of an outsider in this one, maybe not that much screen time, but overall he just fits in nicely. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) finally we get a peek in her story outside of the Avengers, she does that catlike fighting that we loved in IronMAn 2, she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes, nicely done. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has a dominating presence in this one - we finally see the mastermind / spy / agent finally in work, and he works his ,,magic,, well. Clark Gregg as Agent Caulson is back and he brings not only the comic character but the bad-ass Agent with a ,,punch,,. A nice addition is Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill. Last but not least: Tom Hiddleston as Loki the main villain - Thor's brother ( ,,he's adopted,, ) - He is the absolute villain, played so amazingly by Middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect, he just balances the movie out - some of his scenes are fantastic.Now to the movie - i guess i can call it the best Superhero Team movie of all time. If u are not familiar with the other MARVEL movies u will not feel like an outsider, this is a Superhero Movie on it's own and a fantastic one. The pace of the movie does not feel to fast and to slow either, script and dialogues are all in place. The Movie has some of the most hilarious comic scenes ever put in any action ( or even some of the recent comedy ) movies, the synergy between the main characters is perfect in any way. Some of the fight scenes will blow you out of your seats, i had some moments that i really wanted to just jump up - or rewind and watch again. Every character has his moments ( or a few great ones) the team-fight scenes just take this to a whole new level. The CGI and FX are just what we are used from Marvel movies, and even upped a bit in this one. Set designs and costumes are also high quality, the design of the HELLICARIER, the MAcH7 suit is fantastic, i really liked Loki's outfit as well. Sound and Music department also did a great job, Alan Silvestri delivered again, the music really captures the mood of the movie.Finally The Pro's: The assemble cast. The character interaction. The Hulk. Black Widow interrogating Loki. The SMAAASH Moments ( a lot of them ). The after credit scene. The Con's: 1 thing - this is not a 3D movie - it has it's moments but if u can avoid watching it as 3D u will not miss a thing.Rating: 8.5 / Fan-boy Rating 9+",

Here is the blurb, to keep you excited ;) 'Nick Fury is director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The agency is a who's who of Marvel Super Heroes, with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow.

    "reviewBody": "I am not really a fan of movies with too many big characters, but this one i have to say is a truly awesome movie. Its starts off with a bang with Loki making a nice appearance and just carries on from there. The best part of the film comes in its last 1 hour. The actions sequences, the graphics and the spot comedy by the actors is superb. True credit to the director for making enough screen space for all the characters who have performed brilliantly. Special mention about Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), outstanding performance by both of them. Now coming to the storyline, its simple. Loki wants to conquer earth and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team 'The Avengers' to stop the invasion. All the characters have their own special part to play in the film n they carried it out flawlessly. As i said before, the special feature of this film is its action sequences. I was amazed by the way they were pictured. Really an outstanding job. And also the spot comedy, especially by Iron man and hulk were hilarious. In all, an excellent movie with lots of action and style. One of the best super hero movie of all time. Go for it.",

Performance wise...HULK took me by surprise(u ll know when u watch the movie). people JUST Don't MISS THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!THE AVENGERS are here to stay!!!P.S-THE BIGGEST SURPRISE ELEMENT ARRIVES DURING THE END CREDITS!!!ITS GONNA BLOW U OFF!!!",

This movie definitely keeps the style of Iron Man : lots of funny lines, excitement, quick peace line and mouth-dropping high-technology weapons Well-written dialogue loaded with entertainment, message and clue. Some lines make you laugh spontaneously , but when you think them twice will reveal the value of each character.(E.g A:We need a plan of attack B: I got a plan, ATTACK!)The plot is very 3D ! It well-depicted the role, character and struggle of each hero to make you hardly dispense anyone of them in the movie. Say I cannot imagine how this movie will looks like if your take The hulk away, not to mention Iron Man!!!In short, I never check my watch during the play as every second is so breath-taking Currently it is the first runner up on my comic hero movie list, just after Batman (the villain and the inspiring quote of Batman is unparalleled!)",

And since there are aren't any references to the past so anyone who hasn't seen the earlier movies would still be able to understand every detail. I don't really have words to describe how the movie was because it literally blew my mind! I've already seen it twice in the same day. The movie has all the elements of fun and is a total package but from my side I would have to say Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were the stars of the movie. Must watch movie.

    "reviewTitle": "All in all, one of the best films I've seen in a while.",
    "reviewBody": "Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.I feel all of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was underused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I was never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the film's funny lines coming from him.Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I think he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared previously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.Hawkeye was really well played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I don't know why. But regardless he is a great character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark replied \"Ok hang on then Legolas\". Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.The humour of the film mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There were deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruce's alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as well, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).One small annoyance I had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful being ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them). It's just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thor's Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it doesn't even leave a scratch on Captain America's shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.I also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, they're always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battle.But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it.",

It is oddly strange that the movie opened a week early in different parts of the world. It should have opened first in the USA before anywhere else. To top it off, I only paid around $6.50 to experience the movie in 3D and inside an IMAX Theater. Here in the US tickets will cost around $12.25 in a regular theater.\"The Avengers\" exceeded all my expectations of any \"Superheroes\" movie. It is a movie full of action from beginning to end. This movie is very close to the animated movie \"THE AVENGERS\", but with a very pleasant twist since the acting and the filming was believable. It is hard for me to choose who my favorite actor was. All of them did an incredible job performing their part. I do have to mention that even though the \"HULK\" was computer animated (CGI), it was a breath of \"fresh air\" to see him in this movie. He was funny at times and also very real looking.",

    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie and it blew away my mind. The 2,5 hour sit wasn't long enough, I wanted more!!!!! Mark Ruffalo playing Bruce Banner was best I have seen so far and seeing the Hulk smashing Thor into a building just after a heavy fight against the aliens was pure win and made my eyes tear of laughter! Than Loki saying something and gets interrupted by the Hulk who smashes Loki into the ground afterwards saying \"puny god\" was another exact replica off the comic book hero I so love and enjoy. Just seeing this in that movie made the movie 8 out of 10. The two extra stars was cause the rest of the movie was just brilliantly put together, with the mayhem, the jokes, the storyline, the depths of most characters! Yes, I know people wanted to see more depths in the storyline, but come on, you got 6 Avengers with all different stories, the villains who have there story, and you need to make a movie that isn't to long to let it stretch to much, but still contain every ingredient to make it a good movie. No, not a good movie, an excellent movie, like a true superhero movie should be. Don't compare this movie to other superhero movies!!! There you only have 1 character and 1 villain to explain and rest is story. Compare this when you saw the previous story lines of the main characters. So watch Iron Man 1 and 2 and The Incredible Hulk (with Edward Norton, not as good as Mark Ruffalo, but you will know the background better for The Avengers) and Thor and Captain America first! You will have enough knowledge to see this movie and rate it excellent. Don't go here to expect a high intelligence movie or rate it with The Dark Knight (who was good, but stand alone and DC comics, not Marvel, different studios, different styles!). Im waiting for The Dark Knight Rises, cause I love those movies as well and the comics and Hulk and Batman are my two out of three most favorite heroes. Sorry Spidey, but your first real good movie has yet to come. This movie was awesome and had everything! Thank you Josh Whedon for displaying the characters as if they were straight out of the comic. Thank you for this joy in my life :)",

    "reviewTitle": "Most action-packed Superhero movie ever - but the plot's a bit basic.",
    "reviewBody": "Well, for years Marvel Studios have been building up to this movie, teasing the fans, and providing a lot of solid entertainment flicks along the way. So does it live up to expectations? Well, for me at least, it certainly does. The movie is often jaw-dropping, exciting, funny, and full of those fan boy moments we've all dreamt about. Thor vs The Hulk? You got it. Thor Vs Iron Man? Yep, present and correct.The actors all do well and have many moments to shine, but Robert Downey Jrs' Tony Stark gets a lot of the best lines, while Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow gets a surprising depth to her character. Director Joss Whedon has skilfully avoided the Iron Man and the Other Guys movie this could have been - Avengers is a true ensemble piece with a script that skilfully blends the various heroes' backgrounds and personalities. Whedon has scored big time.Boy do you really feel the power of The Hulk and Thor - this is on a different scale to those characters' solo movies. Mark Ruffalo is easily the best Bruce Banner ever, and The Jolly Green Giant has never been so awesome. And there's a surprising amount of screen-time for some of the \"lesser\" characters - Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye's is great and fan fave Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson is again top notch.With all the awesome mayhem going on, poor ol' Steve Rogers must feel mightily underpowered when up against The Thundergod, O'l Greenskin and The Golden Avenger; yet Capt America gets some good moments, too. Tom Hiddlestone is again excellent as Loki - a bad guy with some weight always makes these movies work better. His confrontation with The Hulk is a sheer joy, the sort of thing which smacks you full in the face and makes you laugh out loud.My only gripe is the central plot idea. Marvel themselves must have used it a hundred times at least in their comics, and if you're gonna do an alien invasion story why not use The Skrulls or The Kree - better known aliens? What you do get is a spectacular battle for New York between The Avengers and the aliens. The latter are just cannon fodder but it's terrific, stupendous stuff. If you want brooding introspection go to The Dark Knight. Want Wham! Bam! Kapow! go here!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Big on effects & small on story",
    "reviewBody": "Let me make it clear that this along with the Dark knight returns and Django unchained are the 3 movies that I am really looking forward to in 2012. After seeing the Avengers in 3D my first reaction was \"awesome\" but after thinking about it more i felt let down with the story. With so many super heroes and just one formidable villain the Avengers were always going to come on top. So how would the story make it more difficult for the heroes was going to be a challenge. Unfortunately the script failed miserably in that department. Since Joss Wheadon (who is himself a great graphic novel writer ) was helming the multi starrer, expectation was that he will have something more than just big effects. Super heroes movies like Spider-man & the Dark Knight are blockbusters but have a great story to tell as well. The Plot is simple, Loki (Thor's brother played by Tom Hiddlestone admirably ) decides to steal some \"Transsomething\" which opens the gate to another dimension from where aliens would attack earth and Loki would rule it. Nick Fury assembles the Avengers: The Ironman (Robert Downey Jr brilliant as always), Captain America & The Hulk and Thor to fight against the other worldly aliens. The only problem is that these superheroes need to get along with each other and put their egos aside to fight the alien invasion. The pros: Fantastic action, great visual effects, good one-liners, The HULK! The Con: a weak script and a predictable plot.Its a great watch but could have been so much better. Cheers!!!",

    "reviewBody": "The exact dose of characters, with much surprise and play a valuable hero: the human and non-conformity as a vital force of a cause. A perfect black humor and characterization of Robert Downey, Jr. and Mark Ruffalo, with 15 minutes of electrifying battle. Incredible and exciting heroes! One by one: Iron Man a braggart, but risky and a little action selfish ever even thinking of a end \"highest\" and love of Gwinnett. A naive Captain America, but with a great inspiration and strategic capacity, almost a child in battle, wonderful. Thor, a demigod but assessing human vulnerability, with a fine sense of humor and war. Hulk, as ever, fun, with a great sense of humor reflects his intelligence and his other hand focused on what we love in this kind of series: destruction and unpredictability. Scarlet, divine, but not greater role as Hawk, but no matter, they accompany and adorn in a dual process between a shady past and a debt to the world. And an evil, powerful, bright disruptive, but above all, unpredictable and fun!",

    "reviewBody": "Avengers Assemble. As a 21 year old Marvel fan/Comic fan i've been looking forward to this movie since the announcement of its production, and i'm happy to report that my excitement wasn't in vain. I've always said that an epic movie must make you want to immediately see it again, and the Avengers has done just that.One of the many things that i loved about this movie was that it is obvious that the production team has taken time to research Avenger comics and cartoons. I have seen many criticisms made by the general public of a certain character (Hulk) and about how he is different from the last two films. What these people don't realise is that the way the Hulk is portrayed in the Avengers is the way he was created by Stan Lee & CO, if anything the Hulk is proof of the hard work and dedication that the production team has put in to making this movie.I could go on and on about the film, but i'm not. I just recommend everyone to see it in cinema. Perferably in 2D as 3D suck (in my opinion)! Avengers Assemble is the best film i've ever seen. . . so far. Stay tuned for Dark Knight Rises!",

    "reviewTitle": "Incredible!",
    "reviewBody": "I am a huge fan of superhero movies, so I had to see this one in the cinema. I had my doubts about this one though. A group of individual superheroes who don't know how to work together and have to work together as a team. And yes, it was just this way how the movie started. The first half was boring. I don't like Jeremy Renner as an actor and this movie didn't change that feeling for a bit. I just don't like \"hawkeye\".The Hulk (and of course Mark Ruffalo) was just... incredible. Yes, he is the best Hulk ever, but to be honest, it is Bill Bixby who has put Banner on the screen in the first place. We are now in 2012 and now Mark is the Bruce, who will be the next Bruce Banner? The Hulk was funny, surprisingly good, entertaining.That the movie was about Thor and his half brother was disappointing. I thought we had that fight one year ago.Now there is one thing that is bugging me. This year is all about competition between the avengers and the dark knight rising. I don't think the new Spiderman will be in the same race, but I like to be surprised. After seen this movie, I hope I will be satisfied in July with The dark knight rising. The Avengers just didn't entertain me the whole time. Some parts it was just boring.The movie had action, a lot of jokes. The second half was great, but I still don't rate a whole movie on the second half.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply fantastic!",
    "reviewBody": "This really is a great superhero film, outclassing all of the previous films except Ironman I. This is a superb ensemble piece where all the characters shine. I have to say that Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner was a stroke of genius - as portrayed by Ruffalo, Banner is mild, humorous, hurt and self effacing. The Hulk here gets his best outing yet as a flaw in the previous two movies was that the Hulk was more likable than Banner and you spent the whole time waiting for him to change. This is not the case in the Avengers where Bruce Banner is just as entertaining and Ruffalo portrays him as hurt but not dull or sullen (as happened in the other movies). He manages to hold his own even with RDJ on screen (no mean feat!). In the film the best of the scenes involve Hulk and Ironman but everyone plays vital roles and no one is superfluous. Although, Tony Stark really does steal every scene and he finally gets to show just what Ironman can do. Ironman gets his best action outing to date! If only Ironman II could have been even a tad like this. The script is witty, coherent and just fun. Pepper Potts returns to continue the awesome romance with Ironman which really fits in perfectly with the film.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers....ASSEMBLED !! (contains spoilers)",
    "reviewBody": "Back in 2005 since Marvel Studios had just been formed they were toying with the idea of making an 'Avengers' film.At first they provided subtle hints in some after credits and well as in-movie scenes.Nick Fury appearing at the end of Iron Man and Stark appearing at the end of Incredible Hulk movie'(both talking about the avengers initiative) -we already knew what was in store for us.Finally after 5 films and a wait of 11 years (in total) we get this great film from Joss Whedon (of Buffy:TVS fame) who takes the foundation that was built in prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history.Seriously I cant even begin to review this movie and i fear i wont be able to write much about this EPIC movie.This movie has to be seen to be believed .So ill just write down what i loved (or hated) about the movie character wise.LOKI Tom Hiddlestone gives an excellent portrayal of Loki. He appears more evil this time around compared to Thor movie.My favorite Loki scene is where he demands the people of the city to kneel before him.reminded me of ''KNEEL BEFFOORE ZOD''Capn America Portrayed by Chris Evans.This time his character is more likable compared to CA:TFA .He has the best dialogs (apart from RDJ) .The image of Chris as Human Torch is entirely wiped out from your mind, Best Capn scene :''Why should i take orders from you?'' scene.Black Widow: portrayed by Scarlett Johansson .She has a better role this time compared to Iron Man 2.Wasp should have been in the film instead of her.Hawkeye. Weakest Character of the movie.(and i am not talking strength wise or anything) Little to none back story provided.Didn't get a film based on him apart from a few minutes in THOR. Also got converted into being Loki's minion pretty fast . But the scene where he shoots at the Chitauri army without even aiming is bad-ass.Thor. portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Simply awesome. He has the best entrance scene in the film. Fav Thor scene : Are you afraid of a little lightening ?'...'No i am afraid of what comes later'' sceneNick Fury played by Muthaf***king Samuel Jackson .Finally he gets his own movie.His mother will be proud.And why was he trying to shoot the jet with a pistol?Who does he think he is ? Tintin?Maria Hill played by Cobie Smulders. Kids back in the summer of 2012 your aunt Robin decided to join the Avengers. She had a good role BTW.Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr.On second thoughts he doesn't even play the character.Robert Downey IS Tony Stark.Many people I know have just seen the Iron man movies and will go to see Avengers just to see him. Plays the character efficiently and wisecracking at his best . Fav Iron man scene : Suiting up Mark VII Trivia:(he wears a black sabbath shirt in this movie. Black sabbath wrote Iron Man theme in the first movie)Hulk/Bruce Banner Easily the best character of this movie.Mark Ruffalo surpasses Edward Norton in his portrayal of the green giant.Each and every scene he is in is awesome. Finally we get to see a good hulk after two mediocre HULK films. Fave hulk scene : Loki Rag doll scene.Final mention to : AGENT COULSON portrayed by Clark Gregg. R.I.P Phil Coulson ! Marvel has lost a great character with his death. His death is perhaps the biggest shock of this movie .And he couldn't even get his capn cards signed :'(But at least he died with a bang. Agent Sitwell makes a brief appearance. fave Coulson scene ? all of em.. Trivia:Joss Whedon is known fr killing of beloved characters in his shows.Technically speaking :By Hollywood standards This movie shouldn't even exist because it is way too risky. But somehow they have managed to pull it off flawlessly Marvel has already announced Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and Avengers 2 (where its pretty evident that the main villain is Thanos). They should bring War Machine back in Iron man 3.his absence is noticeable. Honestly I don't think any other 2012 movie can beat this one (though the DARK KNIGHT RISES might just do it)BTW speaking of team up movies ...does anyone remember the live action JLA movie of 1997 :p",

The Viewer will follow the earth mightest heroes on their Quest vs the antagonist Loki and his army of aliens who want to capture the earth.

Of course the are many problems when you are put in a group of other guy who are as epic as you. So the viewer will see how the character will go trough their confrontations with the others. But they can only win if they work in a team which happens in the climax....

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers assembles mind-blowing!",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers ReviewOn Friday 27.04.2012 I dressed myself with my Captain America t-shirt, and went to watch The Avengers in 3D. I was really excited and the movie was mind-blowing. I was expecting this movie to be good, but not as great as it was. I can still criticize it a bit. I think that the way the characters were introduced was mostly good, but I think that the Iron Man introduction was not the best. I think they shouldn't showed Iron Man in his suit. For those viewers who haven't watched any of the earlier Iron Man movies; it would have been better if we saw Tony Stark/Iron Man without his suit. I think it's important that people who doesn't know the characters get to know the human inside the suit. That isn't much of a problem from me, who have seen Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This is just something which could have been a little bit better for those who have not seen any Iron Man movie. This movie is better than all The Transformers movies, but the same thing is repeated here. The thing that I'm talking about is that a kid is talking about what he saw, and he thinks its super cool and awesome. I've seen this in many movies before and I don't like it much. In reality it would have most likely have been considered a serious and dangerous incident. I don't think any kid would have reacted that way, because kids are smart enough to understand that what was happening was really dangerous. In this story, New York is being attacked from a different place in the universe. They get there through a portal that Loki opened for them. In this story everybody should still have been shocked after they won the war. I really don't think there would be anyone who was talking about it being cool. There is one woman who reacts in a much more realistic way, she was very thankful for Captain America and The Avengers saving her and them all. That is realistic; they should all be thankful, but not talking about it like it was being an action movie. What I mean is that in that situation a kid would be thankful, and not talking about how awesome it was. In this story it was real, and then I think it's weird that the kid is talking about it like it was an action movie. I know that this is a movie, where the main point is to make it a movie that the whole family can watch. I understand it well on the business part, because a movie that the whole family can watch is a movie that gets more tickets sold. They really need to make as much money as possible, when they have so expensive and amazing special effects. Not to speak of the costs of great actors, make up and great cameras. This is a hard movie to make, and how great it is impressive, there are many great movie makers behind the movie. Joss Whedon have done an amazing job directing this big movie. And Zak Penn did a great job writing the story for this movie, and also did Joss Whedon who's also the screenplay writer for this movie. The movie is an amazing mind- blowing breath-taking experience. I have never seen any superhero movie as amazing in special-effects. The movie has a great cast, with funny lines and you really get afraid if they will die in the fight. Because you like the characters so much, and thanks to the earlier movies you have begun to know them. Robert Downey Jr. is funny as in the earlier Iron man movies. And he plays his character confident, funny, wise and brave. Mark Ruffalo makes the Bruce Banner character a nice and smart person. When he's the Hulk, he is not nice, he is dangerous and wild. Chris Evans plays the Captain America character wise, brave and nice. Chris Hemsworth plays the Thor character confident, god-like, wise and nice. Tom Hiddleston plays his character evil, mad, wise and mighty. He is theatrical actor, who also according to an interview was inspired by Shakespeare's Richard the Third, when he was creating the Loki character with Joss Whedon. The movie is great movie, with good acting. Still I wonder how this movie would be, if it wasn't made to also fit for kids. Movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and Watchmen, is great and not very child friendly. Again The Avengers is still great and I really enjoyed it. It's probably one of the best superhero movies ever made!",

    "reviewBody": "Quite truly, this is a film that makes your mouth water while watching it. The man and the character that steals the film is Hulk played Mark Ruffalo. He adds this unique stint to the character commonly known to be scary ruthless monster. He actually has the best comedy 'bits' in the whole film. We all thought Iron man/Tony Stark would provide the humour in the film, he does, but I feel he was casted down to be more of a super hero. You will understand what I mean when you watch it. This brings me to the point, would the Iron Man and Avengers movie franchise be any good without Robert Dwoney Jr. He is truly an incredible actor, that is so suited to the character of Tony Stark. I don't wanna say anymore, and I am so damn tempted to give away a couple of spoilers, but I have to resist to let you enjoy this fabulous movie. GO WATCH IT.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers good but not as much as the hype",
    "reviewBody": "I just watched Avengers, 2 hours ago, and I personally don't think Avengers lives up to the hype it has got. Is it a good movie? That's a definite yes from my side, anyone who's into action movies and who knows these characters would enjoy the movie. But for people who don't really know much about these characters would get a little bored and might find it hard to follow, as it happened with my friends. 10 of us went for the movie, 3 people though it was hard to follow. Also one should know they are going for an action movie, action sequences are awesome, dialogues are OK not exceptional but OK. They have tried to make the movie funny, but there are only like 3 laughs out loud moments, with 2 other that makes you smile. Interestingly enough Hulk was in 3 out of 5 of those moments. Iron Man is funny, but now wow funny. Thor looked very ordinary in the movie, his acting was OK not wow. Captain America looks a little misplaced among the super powered people, and sadly Black Widow has a lot more say in the movie than does Captain America. Hawkeye got his moment to shine but isn't as focused as one who expect. Hulk and Loki, their acting stood out. Of course, Loki being the main villain gets the most to do and Hulk was the funniest among them all, after he transforms. MINOR SPOILERS, it's nice to see hulk finally learn how to control his transformation although how he learns it is never shown. There are few plot holes in the movie, we don't really understand how Hulk from being a raging uncontrollable monster because a hero all of a sudden and decides to fight for the avengers. Nick Fury doesn't get to do much apart from blow up a helicopter, Captain America has some fights scenes before Loki brings his army but later Captain America didn't really play a big part in the movie at all. Aliens were below par, they didn't even spend time with the aliens, and they looked more like mindless beasts following command from their master, who is shown post credit and will not be named for the purpose of this review. There are no twists and turns in the movie, the story could easily have been summarized in few lines as Loki - World Domination - Army - Avengers Assembles - gets his arse handed to him. Action scenes were AWESOME and it's a very action heavy movie. I hope I have not spoiled anything for you because I don't really wanna get into details of how the movie actually plays. What I truly believe is you will not be bored watching the movie, but it's not something as amazing as say The Dark Knight.",

    "reviewBody": "I can not say anything more about THE AVENGERS; the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more. It didn't only entertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would; it told a great superhero team story.The characters were written perfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like \"IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,\" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far. Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go and watch it.",

    "reviewBody": "The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.Adding to the mix, we have tight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief appearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well everything.On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin stories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to create a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears sidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.Whedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.Complaints, the film does feel long and there are shades of \"Transformers 3\" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers? The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson) in full, \"hell yeah\" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat. Loki wields his staff with aplomb, initially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your medical training.The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screen.Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play Comic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.So to the characters. Stark is just Stark, every mans wish fulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The trusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portman's character is referenced but not shown on screen.Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable \"old world\" can do attitude, which is a pleasant antidote to Iron Man's showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaos.Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The \"Hulk\" whose character development in real life now has morphed through three \"A\" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.The Hulk is played rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.Clearly the studio are thinking big, stay for the set up as it is clear the \"Avengers\" work is not done yet.Summary Yet another high for the comic book genre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.Big, loud, expensive comic book superhero mashup. Not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed for the spectacle on show and the obvious thought, care and intelligence invested in the series.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",

    "reviewTitle": "About as spectacular and fun as you could wish for.",
    "reviewBody": "So glad to see that this movie did basically nothing wrong. I had my fears and doubts about it, I mean, so many big superheroes in one movie, isn't that like having too many captains on one ship? But no, everything I feared for got greatly and cleverly handled in the movie and I liked it even far better than expected.The movie simply made all of the right choices it seemed. It used the best elements from the Iron Man movies, \"Thor\", \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" and the Hulk movies. Not only that, it also used the best of its main characters. Everybody of course has their own set of skills, powers and specialties, which greatly get used in the movie. Everybody gets to do something and gets about as much screen time as the other. Many people thought that Tony Stark/Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., would steal the show and get most of the screen time, since his character is the best and most fun one. But no, every hero gets their moment of glory in this movie and their moment to fully shine, even those without the superpowers, such as Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson. But if you would force me to point out one person that gets to shine the most in this movie, it would be the Hulk, played this time by Mark Ruffalo. You have never seen the Hulk do so much awesome stuff and he also definitely comes across as the most powerful one of the bunch.It's so awesome and a true accomplishment that they actually pulled it off to get all of these characters and actors together for this one movie. Lots of characters from the Iron Man movies, \"Thor\" and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" reprise their roles in this movie, which makes all of the movies feel more connected than ever before.It's also a real accomplishment that they managed to keep the same style and tone throughout the entire movie. This also caused Iron Man to not take over the movie for instance, with his wisecracking jokes, or Thor with his old fashioned, Shakespeare-like, dialog. The entire movie feels like one big whole, even when its purely focusing on just one of its main characters.I also really loved the interaction between all of the characters. They don't all like each other and some are even somewhat suspicious of each other. A true ego-clash if you will, which also results at times the different superheroes battling each other. This is the sort of stuff that I'm sure of lots of fan-boys and girls wanted to see. It also was a great move to make Loki the main villain of this movie. He was the best villain, in all of the Marvel superhero movies, in my opinion, so personally I was very glad to see him return, in such a big role again. And yes, every superhero has a go at him at one point in this movie, which again, is something that fan-boys and girls will be drooling at, especially since it's all something truly great and spectacular to watch.And it really is a spectacular movie. Basically it's being like non-stop, action fun and the movie it's final perhaps is the best and most spectacular one you are ever likely to see. Truly some intense and awesome stuff to watch, when all of the superheroes for the very first time truly work as a time and battle side by side with each other. Stuff that will give some people goosebumps for sure, also because it's filmed so extremely well, with the help of some great looking special effects as well.But how about the story? well, it's nothing too great or original but this hardly harms the movie. It's all about its main characters coming together and teaming up for the first time, on film. Really, the story is totally secondary and most of the time you wont even pay attention to it, since there is so much else good stuff going on screen! Joss Whedon did a more than great job with directing this movie.This is basically how great, fun, spectacular, big budget, entertainment should be like!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

    "reviewBody": "Earth's Mightiest Heroes come together under one roof, led in battle by the perfect soldier himself Captain America, to face the Asgardian Villain Loki or as Hulk put it \"Pewny god\".First thing, what happens when u put Bruce Banner and Thor in a vessel way up in the sky and then Banner sets Hulk loose?Chaos like no other.I have to say watching this film will put you at the edge of your sit for the total 2hours 15mins. Sadly to say Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) acting was the weakest among the group and Mark Ruffalo's was the best.But the hero to watch out for is the Hulk, this massive walking gamma radiation will make you laugh, trip, and then roll on the fall clutching your ribs.You don't believe me? Go get a dose of The Avengers.This movie is CGI invasion, almost everything at the final frontier (final battle) was CGI incorporated. So well crafted was the CGI and so well mastered were the actors themselves that they flowed with the scenes with ease.The comic relief in the movie were both The Hulk/Banner and Thor, these were the high notes:1. When they took down an invading alien ship 2. When Hulk and Loki met face to face. 3. When Banner and Thor discussed Loki.I felt the comic relief was well crafted into the movie; kudos to the script, the screenplay and cinematography were also on point.The screenplay was done by Joss Whedon who worked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, he made every scene especially the fight and battle scenes so interesting a sight. The comedy/action scenes were precise and will leave you gasping for breath, as you never expect them. Even now that I told you where they are still... you won't see it coming, trust me.Directing in its part had to be done by a master director, because having all this heroes together, you have to be able to mix and match, so that none is underutilized and none is hugging the screen time, nice work Joss.And watch out for cool camera angles, one had Captain America assessing a scene and we get to see it from a reflection.Again a wonderful performance by Tom Hiddleston (Loki), when he played Loki in the 2011 Thor, he did it so well I actually thought he knew the guy. Here too he did the same, I hope this won't be the last we hear of him.Wasn't so exciting, was the Iron Man character (although that is my point others may view it differently), his humour always went over my head all through the movie. Black Widow and Hawk Eye, they held their own as they had no powers or a special suit, they made sure they had their share count of dead robotic bad guys. Captain played an important role in the end, but the thing that was worth the watch in his character is the way he was oblivious about things. Thor was graceful as usual, but the Hulk was the icing on the cake.All in all, go see it.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Great Example of Quality Movie-making",
    "reviewBody": "\"The Avengers\" is a great exercise in the art of fantasy movie-making. Its exemplary and superior production value, great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated (those who haven't seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk & The Iron Man franchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest Superhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVEL's finest effort till date. Director Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic. It's an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth. The On-screen chemistry between all the lead characters is uncanny and unparalleled. 10/10, a must watch for every Hollywood movie buff & Superhero aficionado.",

    "reviewBody": "Please if you haven't watched it yet, don't read my review or any other review, just go and see it!if you are not into marvel movies, if you haven't watched every other previous installment of the avengers, you won't find this movie very appealing to you. But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself, because Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!thats the thing about this movie, its not really a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not really a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with that somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.You can really fell that Whedon knows and loves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This movie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.For the first time, i felt a nerdgasm, I'm not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.I love good movies, i do, i know a lot of movies and I'm not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this. The avengers is one of the best experiences i have ever had in my whole life. i will see it at least 3 times more",

The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like \"IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,\" your fears will be washed away.Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go and watch it.",

    "reviewTitle": "'We're not a team. We're a time-bomb!'",
    "reviewBody": "The Avengers gathered huge expectations since it was officially announced in 2010. When separately the marvel comic characters can rock in the movies, then what massive consequences can happen when they are assembled altogether. From Tony Stark to Clint Barton, The Avengers group is subversive and totally heroic in their move. A Lot of money ($220,000,000) is involved here as there are spectacular special effects and eye-popping destructive acts. Till now, there is a huge chaos created allover revolving the release of the movie, even in India. A huge profit is estimated for the movie. Anyway, Let's see how this movie works.Nick Fury is the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The Tesseract is an unknown source of huge sustainable energy that can come to much need of planet earth. But when Loki (Thor's Brother) steals The Tesseract and tries to demolish the earth as directed from Asgard, Nick Fury assembles The Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Hawkeye to eliminate the extra-terrestrial attack on earth and save humanity. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury does a perfect job. Even not being a superhero, his special role as a colonel in every marvel hero movie is commendable. Tony Stark aka Iron Man is said to be the salient character of Avengers even Captain America is the first one of them. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is remarkable, humorous, smart, sleek and heroic and most of all perfect from every nook and corner. Without Iron man's technological help and cleverness, The Avengers would have to face much problem.Steve Rogers aka Captain America, the first Avenger does here a nice work indeed. To him, saving America's glory and assets is everything and so he does. Chris Evans as Captain America was a Joy to watch and he was the only hero that can stand beside Iron Man shoulder-to-shoulder.Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, is the strongest and mightiest and toughest pillar of the Avengers. Even Edward Norton was the leading hero of \"THE INCREDIBLE HULK\", Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk here also gives much justice and creates a great atmosphere of strength and destruction.Chris Hemsworth as Thor (Which we have seen previously in the movie named on him) was indescribable. He is said to be the God Of Thunder from Asgard and here with his mighty hammer, he yet again creates a great appearance and makes a strong impact in defeating enemies. Nothing is greater than Myst and Gods, in that case. Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson was effective as the only female superhero character in the midst of powerful masculine superheroes.Clint Barton aka Hawkeye was fine and he seemed to be the weakest among the Avengers but still he was effective in his negative pre-climax and heroic role in the climax.Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother seeks revenge on his brother and tries to rule the world as the only God. So, the character with so much vengeance and thirst and also battling the Avengers all alone had to be very important for the movie and so it was. Among all others, the most important one was Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and he did a splendid even 'The Avengers' movie puts an end to his character forever. Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsgård, Gwyneth Paltrow & more - everyone carried out their roles splendidly.It was very lucky for me to watch the movie in 3D as the remarkable special effects by Chad Ball, Roland Blancaflor, David Boucher & more and Visual effects by Visual Effects by Shaun Friedberg 'Pyrokinesis', David Abbott, Nada Abdou & more was the most important substance of the movie. Massive Destruction, Aliens, Super natural powers - everything was excellently perfect. Can't be better than this. Also, I would specially recall the use of humor in the movie that made people laugh at times. Also, the dialogues of the movie are excellent. Some awesome ones like - Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack! Tony Stark: I have a plan : attack! & Thor: He's my brother Natasha Romanoff: He killed 80 people in 2 days Thor: He's adopted.Even, this is the second directorial of the director Joss Whedon, he does a commendable job and I doubt if anyone could have done it better. Joss pens down the story with Zak Penn with the help of the writing by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby (The original comic book writers) and gives birth to a very efficient story that perfectly got along with the movie. Finally, when I saw in the final scene where Tony Stark & Pepper Potts were redesigning devastated Stark Tower and only the 'A' stood among the five letters, I was fully assured that the movie did not intend to glorify any one Marvel Hero but glorified their team work as AVENGERS. And if as the end of the movie hinted is true then get ready for THE AVENGERS 2 because Nick Fury said \"We Need Them And They Know That Very Well\".'The Avengers' is one helluva ride of destruction, fighting evil & heroism. Kids will love it and so will the elders. Make some time, take your family, put on your 3D glasses, pop some corns in your mouth and have a epidemical time. If you miss this one, consider it as a huge loss.",

The viewer cares about them and gets invested in to their story and character development. Now, magnify that times ten! Add way better action then we've seen from them in the past and you get the greatest genre work ever put to film with the Avengers. This movie more than lives up to the hype! I was on the edge of my seat several times during the film and I can't believe how fast over two hours flew by. Avengers is THE best comic adaptation film of all-time, period and end of story. That doesn't take away from past exceptionalism, even past Marvel films themselves but Avengers just delivers beyond what we've seen before from anyone. As good as Spider-Man 2 or TDK were, you really can't compare them because they operate on a smaller canvas and deliver far less notes. After seeing Avengers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you're being honest with yourself and fair to the movie itself.",

It has genuine sense of epicness and suspense that almost makes you think everything will be all right in the end, Meance provided by Loki resonates perfectly, in fact in one of his scenes I felt my heart rate going up! literally. If you only know a bit about the film before seeing it, ;et me tell you he does things that you'd didn't expect which only adds to it all. The visual splendor is huge and with the acting coupled with it believable. The fight sequences can be narrowed down to three things: Tesserect theft, Hellicarrier attack and NY final showdown. It makes you stay on for the ride, it makes wish it could have gone on. Even my family found themselves in joyful hysterics at the end of it!",

Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the low brow, tasteless racist slanderer of Captain America (Yes I know he was doing it to show this mindset was still of that of a white American of the 1940's) towards Samuel Jackson's character made me want to walk out of the film. And I'm not even black. A complete waste of money on my behalf. To see this film receive the high acclamation that it has just goes to show how brainwashed the general population has become due to the continuous release and production of these utterly mind-numbing, idiotic films.Not even worth a star.",

They feel familiar and \"make sense\". The story line is simple and predictable, Evil returns, wants to enslave Earth, team of superheroes assembles and drive evil away... or do they? (stay through the ending credits, trust me).It's not the \"super story\" that keeps you glued to your chair. It is everything else. Somehow you are not the slightest bit annoyed (or care for) the predictability of the story. I don't think a better director could have been chosen for this film. Joss Wheddon has just the right amount of childhood wonder still in him to re-create something magical ... it was like.. watching the coming book come to life!! Please tell me there is a sequel!!!",

    "reviewBody": "Yes, its a superhero (super cast) marathon, insane CGI and production values at its best, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that, what people don't know is why Avengers will work for most and not for a few.i believe the real heroes of this movie are two guys Joss Wheton (Director/Writer/Screenplay Writer) Seamus McGarvey (Cinematographer) I have observed the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay. As a film student myself i can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have two different work spaces (unless they are people who get along on a very personal level) they would never get it rolling on film. That's why people like Christopher Nolan/Peter Jackson take their movies into outer space. OK, Enough crap. What's bad?The fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic (non human) plots. The story moves in a predictable direction and the thrills were expected (only well presented). The fact that there's currently no Spiderman/Xmen in Marvel's 'Avengers' scheme of things will disappoint a few fans (Although Marvel Studios are onto Sony Columbia and Fox to get individual character rights for sequels). So surely a group of people will find it ordinary or not worth their time.What's good?You will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with this plot have been made any better at all? All the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much character development and depth as a 142 min film could've allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it into the trailers and get audiences rolling in. The cinematography is fantastic for example there a couple of scenes where we (camera) are in the car and we see ourselves rolling! and the action scenes are done so that you can register/admire them properly (Michael Bay should have a look into this!). Joss Wheton is top class all through. Classic big screen adventure!For the majority of the fans. You will clap, cheer, hoot at Robert Downey Jr's quirks, Dr. Banner/Hulk's smash comedy and will admire Chris Evans commands as Captain America, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The visuals are fantastic, the plot is entertaining all through. 3D is an added feature which i personally enjoyed tremendously. If you have a group of friends to go with, this movie will surely make your weekend!",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing mix of heroes, nothing short of sublime",
    "reviewBody": "Here is the movie they were preparing us for. 'Iron Man'. 'Captain America'. 'Thor'. This was where they would eventually go. And brother, it didn't disappoint. Joss Whedon's magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called 'superhero' movies made. The movie featured an interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a spectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, 'Avengers' is a thrill ride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of thrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction. The one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron man's quips are just as well timed as always. Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role. The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I don't understand why the X-men weren't considered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues). But the movie is a wonderful viewing experience and by all means, a treasure. Must see for the summer of 2012.",

    "reviewTitle": "One of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever!",
    "reviewBody": "A culmination of several movie franchises, THE AVENGERS certainly delivers. There could have been many ways that the studios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director: Joss Whedon (former helmer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly on TV as well as an actual comic book writer for Marvel Comics). Whedon knows his stuff and he creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever; the whole film reads as if it was an actual Marvel comic book!Whedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly creates an epic storyline that makes sense. The tesseract (known to comic fans as the cosmic cube) that was the focal plot point of CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) has been recovered and being studied closely by the government when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the villain of the previous THOR (2011) movie appears and takes control of it. In response, Col. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson, in his usual badass self) decides to form a small but lethal response team: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor. If they can get along and work together then they might have a chance to save the world.Being the top billed character because of box-office receipts, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets the best lines and almost steals the entire show. His wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the Avengers, Captain America (Chris Evans, playing the straight man to everyone else) and puts the latter character in a disadvantage- the movie's lone weakness is that Cap doesn't get to do much other than act as a foil to the larger than life Tony Stark. Thor (Chris Helmsworth) does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) give much needed humanity since they are the only members of the team that don't have superpowers. But the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is Mark Ruffalo, who plays the volatile Hulk- Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner as a smoldering Stanley Kowalski, always seemingly in control yet has a temper like nitroglycerine- his Banner is different from the brooding Eric Bana of 2003's HULK or the timid Edward Norton of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008); you don't get to see much of Ruffalo compared to the others but his character is the most intriguing of all. Hiddleston is adequate as the pouty, scheming Loki but you can't help but believe that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding him.The movie is almost perfect but does fail to take chances with their characters. Evan's Captain America is a direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you wished he might have been given more of an edge, like the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Captain America: a slightly racist do-gooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesn't measure up to his 1930's morality. If only the movie had been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2 ½ hours it might have been a systematic one.In the end though, there is something for everyone in this movie, from the constant action scenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clichés. Highly recommended!",

    "reviewTitle": "It is a great movie...",
    "reviewBody": "This many reviews can't be wrong and now I'm part of that group. I won't spoil it with much details but the script is good, the directing is great and the action is just amazing. The biggest surprise for me was Mark Ruffalo's part. I was highly skeptical because of his look and the Hulk's but after seeing the entire movie I have to agree that he is the best Hulk version thus far. I am simply amaze at both Weldon and Mark's work. Just wow.The are two disappointing things for me though. First is Hawkeye. He's only smiles once in the movie and I bet you'll have a hard time finding that part. This is because I've grew up knowing Hawkeye more as a comedic/serious character and not just a pure serious character. That doesn't mean his part in the movie wasn't great. Second is Banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside the team. Sure one can make guesses but I much prefer that one was provided; either as Hulk wanting to protect others as he usually does, or as Banner and Hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept him. But even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives. That was just jaw dropping for me and the Avenger teammates LOL I have to suggest to those that haven't already watched the movie to pay close attention to the dialog's. Many of the lower reviews, especially from film critics, is because they really don't pay attention to the dialog's and rate it down. Plus, you'll see why I enjoyed the Hulk immensely in this movie.Many people are turned off on the fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the so-called hardcore comic fans. I will have to remind everyone here that for most comic superheroes the big, world killer scenarios are from outer space, from aliens. It doesn't matter if it's DC or Marvel, it's exact SAME situation. It's not a copy of Transformers 3 since Michael Bay made up the story in the first place and did a poor job at it. Transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for ages.Don't be surprise but eventually Superman will have Doomsday and his portals. Green Lantern is guardian of the UNIVERSE, don't see how one gets upset at an Alien force coming in to destroy Earth or any other planet that is in their area of protection. Batman and the Justice League will have their Aliens and so forth. Really, what are you complaining about then? That there are too much Aliens? How are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story? That's what I thought. Mindless comic book fans that \"think\" they know better...pffft.If you're happy with just the superhero fighting human villains on and from Earth fine. Stay that way. But don't go bitching because eventually the story of ALL superheroes will involve aliens. You're precious Batman will involve aliens, it's just not there in the form of movies YET. Joker has a big part in aliens and Earth's destruction. Get with it people.As for people complaining about the lack of character development well the answer is simple. Go and watch the respective movies about the super hero you are disappointed about. There are two Iron movies, 2 Hulks, One captain America, One Thor. And while Black Window and Hawkeye don't have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them. They are the less popular heroes of the team that's why. So again, why are people even complaining about this issue in the first place?Seriously though I sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly, even hardcore fans.",

    "reviewTitle": "Avengers: Marvel's on top, so far.",
    "reviewBody": "Marvel's Avengers...A well paced movie that delivers from the beginning. It's hard to review this awesome movie without give some spoilers, but I'll try to do my best, promise.I tried to keep my expectations low about this movie before it came out, because watching this all- star cast playing the \"superheroes\" is exciting itself. you have to add Samuel L Jackson as \"Nick Fury\" and a very good CGI work pumped up by a big amount of money. But I have seen a lot of movies with great casts and high budgets going down (cough *batman and robin* cough), so I decided to stay calm and not to get hyped.So the movie started with a very decent action scene that sets up the whole plot fast and effectively. Even when I tried to forget what this was about, I couldn't help myself and I was sold after the ten first minutes. Why? Because you can't help it!! you get to go in deep with every main character's motivations. The action never stops growing and the tension last until the very last minute. It's impossible not to fall in love with movies like this! Every relationship between the superheroes are well established and when the moment comes, it shows.What are they avenging?: Spoiler! It's Hulk well done in this movie? Hell Yeah!! (finally) It's Tony Stark above the rest of Avengers?: Nope, he's part of an awesome team!Is this movie worth to see on cinemas? oh, please, oh, please, don't miss it. Watch it at least once. 9/10 At the same level of \"the dark Knight\"CONS: Didn't like the 3D. - Black Widow should have kept her long hair. For the rest, no complains.",

    "reviewTitle": "THE AVENGERS: assemble and watch (NO SPOILERS)",
    "reviewBody": "Oh my god, I cant even think straight right now. If you can put adrenaline, passion, love, sex, and everything similar you can think of in a blender, puree it to hell, and down a dozen barrels of the concoction, you might just end up with a feeling similar to the one I had after watching 'THE AVENGERS'. To say it is brilliant would be a gross understatement. It would be like saying the sun is warm or the universe is decently spacious. The movie is a miracle. Anyone who has even a slight understanding of the marvel universe, or has even seen the recent standalone pictures of Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and the Hulk could fathom the insurmountableness of the task of putting them all together in one single two and a half hour movie. That's like asking to fit the Hulk in a pepsi can. I can't even begin imagining how one would even start with it, but if anyone can do it, it had to be Joss Whedon (Director).I know a lot of people might be going to watch this movie just because of the lead characters, but for me the pull was knowing Mr. Whedon was at the helm. For those of you haven't heard his name, think Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly. I have loved all his previous works and expected a decent product from him. The trailers were a bit unconvincing though I must say but I was stoked enough by the time I entered the hall (I was the only guy there wearing an Avengers t-shirt). The movie had a lot to live up for, mainly decades of comic book lore and the expectations of generations of fans, and I am glad to say that it not only meets them but surpasses them in Hulking leaps and bounds.First up three words – HULK! HULK! HULK! The show stealer, the show stopper, the master of ceremonies, the winner of the spotlight award - the hulk yanks the movie all unto himself. If I loved the hulk before, I revere him now. He smashes, he busts heads, he is everything you expect from a superhero and more. You have to see it to believe it. His scenes will leave you screaming with joy and jumping from your seats whooping and dancing in the air. Hulk is the man! And Mark Ruffalo's world weary, resigned Bruce Banner complements the severity of his alter-form completely. While the hulk is brutal, Banner finds repose in avoiding conflicts through wit. When the green rage monster will break bones at the slightest insult, Bruce will take everything thrown at him with a pinch of salt. It's the perfect duality and my favorite character of the whole ensemble seeing that the Hulk has always been one of the most relatable superheroes of all time. The very concept of losing yourself to anger is a very humanly intrinsic characteristic, and knowing this allows you to appreciate his awesomeness even more.And yes, yes, I have not forgotten – Scarlett Johansenn (Black Widow) is there too and she kicks ass like never before. She is stunning and beautiful and sexy and depending on your sexual preferences, the second best thing in the movie (the first still being the Hulk). Her story opens up even more and so does her relationship to Hawkeye (Brett Renner) who is also marvelous in his role too.The most amazing thing in the movie perhaps is not the action (of which there is tones) but the amount of content that they have been able to cram into a single film. The character development is brilliant and even former fringe players like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Coulson get more etched out here than in all their other movies put together. All in all, each character is better represented here than in their own movies (Iron Man and Thor might be the only exceptions).The story itself is a pretty simple one with Loki (Tom Hiddelston), banished from Aasgard at the end of Thor drifts off into space, returns with an alien army to take over the world, and Nick Fury assembles the avengers to defend us. But like they say, the devil is in the details, and so it is here. This movie is riddled with amazing conversations and meticulously placed jokes, most of them occurring in the midst of epic battles. Each characters relation with the other gets etched out during the course of the story and by the end what we have is a comprehensive understanding of what the Avengers are capable of – and with a major reveal at the end of the credits showing us the next villain - you realize that this was in fact just a two and half hour long prologue to what is yet to come. God bless us all.IN SHORT: There is action, there is humor, there are heroes and there are villains. I wont spoil anything for you by describing any scene in length or short, because the whole thing is that amazing. This is a ride everyone must take for the love of their inner child. Unlike the recent dark turn comic book movies have taken since Nolan's Batman, The Avengers embraces its roots unabashedly. Think of all the cartoons you watched, the comics you read, and the toys with which you played out fantasy fights. Whedon has captured them all. This is a movie meant for pure joy, and if you are even half as in love with any of the characters as I am, you will walk out with a major pain in your face muscles from carrying a ear to ear grin from title shot to credit roll.",

    "reviewTitle": "A perfect assemble of superheroes - The Avengers.",
    "reviewBody": "After a long time of waiting finally The Avengers is released. I have waited for this movie from last 3 years. Iron man series is one of my favorite superhero series and I love to see every movie in which Iron man was there. So after long time I went to cinema hall with my cousin and watched the assemble of 4 superhero Hulk, Thor, Iron man, Captain America to save the world with help of Director Nick Fury and his agents Black Widow and Hawkeye.As movies starts it is more concentrated to storytelling and linking of the previous movies Ironman 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and Hulk. The first half part is about summoned of these superheroes. Another part is packed with superb visual effects and sound effects also dialogs are awesome. Especially Iron man's dialogs are hilarious and quick witted.The movie is well balanced with story and action scenes some movies are failed to adopt this phenomenon such as Transformers 3 Dark side of moon and Ghost rider 2 spirit of vengeance. These movies are concentrated to only special effects and lacked in story whereas The Avengers has overcome from this. A mention about Phase 2 sounds like a another part of the Avengers that is part 2. This is one of the best action movie, watch it in theater that would be better than home. So go to cinema hall spend money it's worth it.",

    "reviewTitle": "The best Superhero movie i have seen",
    "reviewBody": "This was one hell of a mind-blowing, fantastic ensemble. I entered the theatre with some trepidation. Don't get me wrong, I love Joss Whedon. His Firefly, Dollhouse really impressed me with their thoughtful insights to complex subjects and excellent stories with witty dialogs. But this being a superhero movie with characters so diverse, I suspected this may just be a mash-up of said characters with some good battles with Whedon's trademark one-liners. Boy was I stumped.This movie never failed to keep my mouth open with shock and sheer awe at what I was watching. Also laughter. This was a movie I will not forget. Or be satisfied with watching only once.Witty dialogs punctuate every minute every one of which are neither clichéd, overdone or badly timed. But humour is only part of its brilliance as story too is pretty good with some amazing, some awesome, some sad and some thoughtful moments. The movie is very well paced, so much so that I barely realised the 140 minutes passing by.The casting was perfect, with all the characters coming over from their respective movies. Except Bruce Banner who was now played by Mark Ruffalo taking over from Ed Norton. In the Hulk movies, Bruce was a scientist struggling with his inner demons threatening to release his darker (greener) alter ego. But here, he needed to be confident, funny, witty, smart (which was seriously downplayed in the 2 Hulks) to have any chance against such powerful characters. Mark Ruffalo carries his character with remarkable panache and delivers a memorable character.The rest of the cast were amazing. Robert Downey Jr as Tony, the self- loving, arrogant and over-smart playboy, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the regal guardian come to stop his brother in his tracks, Chris Evans as the out-of-place hero who tries to fit in, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow who has a substantial role to play (not just eye-candy though she delivers plenty of that too), Jeremy Renner as the stoic and unshakable Hawk-eye and of course, Samuel Jackson as the enigmatic commander, Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston, on the villainous side is amazing as the nihilistic, ego-maniacal Loki who is now stylish, confident and devious in contrast to his Thor persona where he is more childish in his harried quest for revenge. Every character is given a major role with no-one sidelined or underused. All these characters from different eras, locations and occupations are blended beautifully though not without conflicts which are highlighted as a major plot point. This was a much better idea than merely bringing them to save Earth and explaining away these differences which any other director would have easily done.This brings me to Joss Whedon. With Spielberg giving us mediocrities like Tintin, Indiana Jones and War of the Worlds, this comes as a respite from old and boring directors who have been ruling big-budget screen-space for far too long. With X-Men: First Class bringing forth Matthew Vaughn, this too will bring Whedon to the limelight and hopefully, spur producers to give this underrated talent more opportunities.This has been my movie of the year(so far) and the best Superhero movie I have EVER seen. Batman does not count to me as a \"superhero\" movie which is why this wins the title.",

I already want to see it again!Can I say though, for Cineworld Milton Keynes, 3D was not too fab, if you are seeing in 3D, the action scenes are where 3D works best, all other normal dialogue scenes are clearer with the 3D glasses off.So there you are, what are you waiting for?

I'm not sure why, but even with the 3D effect - to be honest, didn't make much difference, until the final battle sequence - but even then it was few and far between! I think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk - was that supposed to sound impressive? There were a few funny bits, especially with the Hulk, but on the whole the film just dragged on without a real purpose - I hope the supposed sequel will be much better!",

Some idea of scene doesn't fall into the traditional and surprise and impress you then.Conclusion: a good one for recreation.",

    "reviewBody": "The movie is awesome, 2 and a half hours non stop action and story twists, the main thing is the movie, when the fight comes i wont that to stop. I want it to continue, it is done in such a graphics and design. Looks real and superb. Even on watching the avatar movie, i don't experience this much fun and acceleration. This movie is meant for non stop action acceleration. The climax is good, i felt sorry that the movie is over, bcoz i don't want to miss the super heroes, even my family too. Everybody from the age of 1 to anything it is, will love to watch the super heroes performing a splendid action to save the world. If you are not watching this movie, you are going to something in your life which is a world wonder project i would say. I will give it endless points if i can for making me to forget who am i for the 2 and a half hours. Enjoy guys... See you in the next avengers...",

    "reviewTitle": "Awesome movie!",
    "reviewBody": "I'm usually very excited to watch a superhero movie, but after hitting a couple of really bad ones I kind of lost my faith for an amazing one. I thought of skipping this movie (figured it was overkill to have so many heroes in one film), but good reviews and the fact that it had Joss Whedon's prints all over it tempted me to go see it anyway. And I was not disappointed. In fact, I was amazed!The threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort. And it is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes you've come to love. I felt it was a well-paced movie, where every hero got to shine in their own way. Annnnnd I think Coby Smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this one: honey, that outfit was...ehm well tailored. ;)If you haven't seen this one yet: run (don't walk damnit) to the nearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 2,5h ride, that'll still leave you yearning for more!",

    "reviewTitle": "OK we have made them desperate..",
    "reviewBody": "To start with i new what to expect a lot of action involving hi-tech gadgets and weapons off-course stark(Downy Jr.) was excellent among the avengers with others acting tough and super-hero's unless there's an exception that is banner(Mark Ruffalo) when he was not the other guy. I think it couldn't have been done any better then this,like the cast itself being heavy and the expectations and hype added it has to be presented with perfection,apart from the loud bangs and crazy clashes between the avengers every other 5 minute which was quiet fun to watch indeed but the lack of story telling again over here kept me silent for a while and gaze only at the screen discovering in this case suddenly a stunt double instead of a black widow(Scarlett Johanson) now that kept me even more silent only later to learn the movie is full of error's here and there in the background but when the action in the middle is just to intense to observe the sides i know who cares.(i got bad seats BTW) the earlier reviews highlight the emerging and graphic part of the film which i must say were amazing and a lot of new stuff to see.To conclude in the end the movie is designed as a summer blockbuster with marvels best joining hands together and fighting the evil Loki who's job is to make people obey and worship him.So in the end a movie you would go to and enjoy from the start till the end only to walk out thinking...yeah! we have advanced in terms of making action/sci-fi movie",

    "reviewTitle": "The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America).",
    "reviewBody": "Before the Avengers assembled we've had 2 Iron Man, 2 Hulk, 1 Thor & 1 Captain America movies. Black Widow was seen in Iron Man 2 and Hawk Eye makes a first time appearance in this one. If you do the math it is pretty clear that to get The Avengers right the director has to get Hulk and Iron Man right. Iron Man is safe in the good command of Robert Downey Jr. but Hulk was the only character that never peaked in spite of two actors (Eric Bana & Edward Norton) trying to nail it in two different movies. For me the biggest triumph of The Avengers is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. He is the best Hulk yet.Whats it about? For those who have not followed the series, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) lands up on earth searching for a cube that will help him rule the earth. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has to stop him so he assembles Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Rufalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson), Hawk Eye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to stop Loki. How is it? Paisa vasool entertainment.My Take Like I mentioned above Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk is the bestest part of the movie. You have to be patient enough for The Hulk to appear. His entry is almost after an hour but Mark Ruffalo prepares the perfect build up as Bruce Banner with his restrained and almost vulnerable portrayal of a character struggling with his condition. The second best thing is the humor. Joss Whedon gives all the characters some really witty lines to deliver. Since most part is about the Avengers coming together the humor helps in keeping the audience engaged especially those who are not well versed with the back stories of each individual superhero. Out of the all the superheroes I was only interested in Robert Downey Jr and Mark Rufalo. The rest were great supporting actors at their best. The icing on the cake is the last 30 mins when the film peaks as a special effects loaded summer blockbuster movie. If you look at director Joss Whedons filmography you'll wonder what made the studios trust him with a rumored 220 million dollar budget film. Now, that is the story I am very interested in knowing! He is the only guy I know who has taken a giant leap from T.V to the big screen. Word of mouth The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America). Rating - **** (Very Good) Ticket Meter Worth any amount of moneyP.S. If you have it playing in an Imax theatre drop everything and make an effort to watch it there. The fun just multiplies with the Imax experience.",

    "reviewBody": "Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last century, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the people who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the names Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk. Comics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They weren't like the comics, took themselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made. The story itself is about heroes with flaws, who need to grow together as a team so they can save the world from a mighty attack from other world. If you like stories of heroes and strange folks you should go see this movie. It's not perfect, but very close being perfect.",

    "reviewTitle": "Loki for an Academy Award please",
    "reviewBody": "I read a few of the other reviews, and while some mention the incredible performance Loki gives, none capture the true brilliance. I expect Tom Hidelston to win an Academy Award for his role in this story. Loki is not evil. Not purely sickeningly evil. Heath Ledger takes top honors for that portrayal as the Joker. Loki is different. He has goals, motives, desires, and pride. He is above all else mischievous, cunning, and calculating, as he attempts to and temporarily succeeds in turning the world's greatest heroes against each other. He truly delivers one of if not the best performance of the movie, and in particular shines a little after an hour into the movie, when Black Widow confronts him on the carrier: \"Your ledger is dripping, its gushing red, and you think saving a man no less virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer— pathetic. You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors; but they are a part of you, and they will never go away. \" All other main characters give stellar performances as well. The Samuel Jackson (an actor I usually despise) brings back all the greatness of Pulp Fiction, except this time bald and with an eye patch. Captain America dominates every moral issue, and though one of the weakest of the team, is the greatest unifier and leader among them. Thor brings back the elegance and civility of a bygone age, combining with Iron Man's sarcasm and cocky swagger in just the right ways to leave everyone grinning. And Bruce Banner finally gets a chance to shine as a brilliant yet conflicted man more than as a raging green beast. Even Black Widow and Agent Caulson have their moments. The only slightly disappointing acting was by Hawkeye, but most of the time he's not fighting, he's brainwashed, so you expect him to be acting a little strangely anyways. And the ACTION. Incredible. Once the final battle starts, there is no letting up. It is brilliant flash after brilliant flash, punch by punch, hit by deafening, glorious, hit. It never lets up, and it is almost impossible not to cry out in excitement. I felt like a little kid all over again. Each team member gets their cameo time fighting off hordes against all odds, and then comes scene after scene of team work. At one point, you follow Iron Man as he blazes a trail, literally, through the oncoming horde, pausing briefly to help each hero as he rushes by. Captain America leads the ground assault, Thor dominates the skies, and Hulk smashes with such agile speed and deadly efficiency you are left squirming in your seat. I am an action junkie, and while I found the opening salvos somewhat dull, especially the car chase, I loved every mini hero battle and almost cried in delight through out the finale. The only Marvell movie I think that stands up to The Avengers as best comic based movie is Woverine: Origins. While Avengers did have better and more exciting action, including the finale, Origins had a more heart wrenching and slightly better told story. The end of Origins, when Wolverine's love dies in his arms, I have a hard time not choking up. That gut wrenching, heart tearing, happy-and-dying-inside-all-at-the-same-time feeling, that make movies like Spartacus and Romeo and Juliet so great, that helped make Origins great, never once came to me in Avengeres. For that reason, I think Avengers did not appeal to me as much as it could have. I just did not feel it inside like I have other stories. Overall, an excellent movie. It started a little slow for me, probably because I was so anxious to see the heroes fighting an alien army. And while I did find the movie very funny at times, I think the trailer kind of ruined it for me: there were lines I remembered loving from the trailers that, in context, were much more serious, and hearing all the laughing in the theater, even though they were lines I laughed at when I watched the trailers, seemed somewhat inappropriate. I rarely give out 10 stars, but I'm still riding the adrenaline from the finale, even without which, I'm not sure I'd lower my score to a 9. Out of 100, this movie definitely scores somewhere in the 90's.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Marvel Film Yet.",
    "reviewBody": "Let's be honest. This could have been one of the biggest disasters in (short) history of Marvel film Studios. Too many characters, an untested (for blockbusters at least) director, a raft of egos, a film packed full of CGI effect heavy action... It could have been, shudder, another Transformers 2. Or worse even Transformers 3. And with any other studio it probably would have been. Thank god then that Marvel have once again proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that when they bring their A game, few others can come close. Marvel have been on a rare run of form that has seen Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and, too a lesser extent, Iron Man 2 all become both critical and commercial successes across the globe. It's fair to say then that The Avengers had some rather large shoes to fill. Well fear not as Marvel and Serenity director Whedon deliver what is probably their best film yet. The Avengers in short rocks. The story: After a familiar villain returns from exile with an army of disposable bad guys in tow, Shield boss Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) has to do the unthinkable... get a disparate bunch of superheroes to work together to protect the Earth from an seemingly unstoppable invasion. Queue the arrival of the cocky Iron Man, buff demi god Thor, man out of time Captain America and sometime hulk Bruce Banner along side Shield mainstays (and as yet without their own solo movies) Hawkeye & Black widow. Yes the story is as simple as that. But in honesty the 'why' is almost less important than the 'how'... because Loki's army never really feel like the insurmountable threat they are billed as and therefore the danger at the heart of the film just doesn't exist, but it's Wheldon's handling of his trademark character interplay (never more importantly mastered that it is here) that really makes The Avengers stand out from the crowd.See because if you didn't know (and if you didn't know where the hell have you been over the past 10 years and what the heck have you been watching!), writer & director Joss Whedon was the creator of TV gold such as Buffy, Firefly and Dollhouse (not to mention a host of rewrite credits including films like Toy Story). He became renowned for his expertly drawn three dimensional characters, sparking writing and groundbreaking story ideas. So it's no surprise that the character interplay is by far the strongest part of The Avengers. In part that is because Wheldon's script delivers - pathos, humor, dread. Often in the same scene. That said if any part of this film would work it was always going to be the script. But it would be nothing without the top notch cast all delivering their A game. As usual Downey Jr shines as the ever humorous Tony Stark , but Evans, Hemsworth and Ruffalo all more than hold their own and, naturally, Sam Jackson could be cool reading from the phone booth. This film was always going to rely on the balance of these characters, potentially the films biggest downfall. As it turns out, it's actually The Avengers strongest asset. Even adding the yet only glimpsed at Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) doesn't leave anyone short changed, finding enough space to make these characters feel fully drawn. Watching The Avengers and seeing what Wheldon has achieved, I honestly doubt if there is a director in Hollywood today who could have managed to balance the ensemble cast as well as he does. That's not to say the action isn't good... far from it. Wheldon puts together some of the best action seen in a blockbuster for some time. Well shot, expertly paced and best of all it isn't edited in that hyper kinetic super quick style that has plagued action films since Bourne & Bay hit he scene. But best of all because these are characters you care about, of actually care about what happens in the action scenes. These aren't faceless robots or badly drawn planks of wood, these feel like real (albeit super powered). Whether it's The Hulk smashing Thor through the bowls of the Shield super ship or Iron Man blowing bad guys out of the sky, the action is clear and often breathtaking. Villain duties fall to Thor bad guy Loki is there to provide the films big bad and is played with relish by the always brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Cocky, arrogant and dangerous, Loki's interplay with Black Widow, Iron Man & Hulk lead to some of the films best (and often funniest) moments. Does it have faults? Of course it does. The first hour takes a while to get going (mistakenly leading me to think I may not have been blown away by the film), Loki's army are a bit meh, lacking in reason or real threat with their own power coming in numbers rather than skill and I would have liked to see a little more of Thor. But these are pretty small issues in what is for all-intense and purpose is one hell of an film. Oh and it would be remiss not to mention that, finally, after two previously flawed attempts someone has finally gotten The Hulk right. Less conflicted then we've seen before, Ruffalo brings a likable but suitably dark edge to a Banner and when Hulk finally does smash he does so better than ever. So a great script, a superb cast, some of the best action we have seen on the big screen for some time... The Avengers is probably one of the top 3 superhero/comic book movies ever made. All this from a filmmaker who has been mostly ignored or abused by Hollywood for he past decade. In Joss we geeks have always trusted and now secret is out. www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk",

    "reviewTitle": "Style.......lots of style, and when all the style is done, some more style",
    "reviewBody": "There is one word that sums up Avengers and that is style and it has awesome witty dialogues that are funny as hell.There was always this fear with Avengers that it would fail to give every character its due, but every single superhero gets time to do his thing, do it in style and look really cool doing it. The interplay between the characters is brilliant. There are lots witty dialogues and most of them range from being very funny to being downright hilarious and there are many scenes that had the audience laughing really hard. Without intending to give much away, there is one scene towards the end involving Hulk and Loki that may just be the funniest scene ever in the history of movies. Each characters gets his due, they play off each other brilliantly. Above all the movie when it decides to get the audience to laugh does a hell of a job.The story is one of weaknesses and it never immerses the audience in the movie and you always feel that you are watching really cool stuff happening from a distance. The story, which is quite simple really, can be summed up in two sentences. Loki has a deal with some aliens that if they help him take over the earth, he will give them a blue cube sort of a thing, which is very powerful. Loki builds a gateway, something like the one between Earth and Asgard in Thor, and the aliens arrive and the Avengers beat them and Loki.Though Loki is the main villain, and he does get nasty and clever at times, he is not who the heroes end up fighting in the final battle. A whole army pops out of the sky, (quite literally) and while all along you are told an army is coming, when it does arrive you sort of wonder who are they exactly. Consequently the army itself, which in this instance happen to be essentially aliens from another of the nine worlds in the Thor story, seem very replaceable, and it would really not make a difference if the army the Avengers end up fighting were huge giant robots. Essentially what the movie makers are telling us that now a big army has arrived and the heroes have a hard task, and that isn't exactly great storytelling.Secondly given the way this alien army is disposed off, by essentially shooting them with guns and arrows, you sort of wonder was this threat big enough to require the Avengers, I mean the army or the navy would have taken care of it, really. In other words the threat doesn't exactly overwhelm you when it arrives.My biggest problem with the story however is that when all the fighting is done there are no lasting impacts, I mean everyone walks off as if nothing happened and things are normal. The kind of invasion that has just taken place would quite frankly be one of those world changing events, but not in the movie, everyone just walks off as if nothing happened.In terms of performances there is not one performance which seems uncool, everyone has they fair share of funny lines to say and look really cool and do things in style. One set of dialogues sums up the final battle, and it goes like this:- Loki - I have an army Iron Man - We have Hulk.This in essence is the final battle for you. Hulk is good enough to wipe out the entire army, and really owns the final battle. Had it not been for the fact that the aliens were just too many in number and even Hulk is not someone who can be everywhere, the other heroes might not even be required. So to give the other heroes something to do there are enough aliens to keep everyone busy and a nuclear bomb thrown into the mix. However don't let this give you the impression that the movie is about Hulk, no its not, its about the others as much as it is about Hulk, just that Hulk is the biggest weapon the Avengers have against the alien army, and he pretty much owns every scene he is in. Some of the comedy involving Hulk is just awesome as well, and let me again remind you not to miss the Loki and Hulk Scene towards the end.So in short the focus of the movie is not on an in depth story, its purely about style. The Avengers is a great example of how if you put enough style into a movie, the simplest of plots can provide tonnes of entertainment. I keep harping on the fact that Avengers is an \"entertainer\" meaning that if you want to have a good time you need to go this movie, you will have a really very great time. The story has its flaws, but if you are out with friends and looking to have fun, you won't exactly watch Schindler's List will you, you will go for something like Hangover. Avengers is awesome entertainer and right up there with the best of them and is a definite must watch.Lastly a lot of talk was on how the Avengers will compare to the Dark Knight and really there is no scope for comparison. I mean trying to compare the two movies is like trying to compare an Apple and a Television Set. I mean they are so different to each other that a comparison is not possible. The only similarity is that they both have Superheroes in them, and that is where the similarity ends. They both are trying to be very different movies, and to try and compare them is futile.So go watch Avengers, you will have a great time.8/10 (only because I cannot rate it 8.5/10)",

    "reviewBody": "OK, I'm going to have to start with the negatives about this film. Oh wait, there isn't any! In all seriousness, this film was incredible! I went to the cinema and watched it in 3D. I already knew that the film was going to be good by reading reviews and going on what my friends said it was like. A large group of us went to watch it and came out wanting to watch it again. There isn't a single scene in it that is boring or that drags. The acting is top class. You think that watching a film with lots of superheroes is going to be cheesy or poor in acting performance. Not with this film. The cheesiest thing about Avengers Assemble was Captain America's suit and, to be honest, that's not even cheesy. The graphics were outstanding, which is what you hope for when you realize the film cost $220 Million to make! Every time you saw the Hulk smashing things up was incredible and not to mention the incredible scene where you see the Aircraft Carrier actually turn into and Aircraft! Overall, Avengers Assemble is an amazing watch, one of the films that you'll want to watch again and that you could say in the future 'I watched that film when It came out in the cinema'. If you haven't seen it already, get to your nearest cinema and be as amazed as I was. If someone says the film wasn't very good, I think its safe to say the have clearly no idea what there talking about! 10 Stars, absolute masterpiece, can't wait for a possible sequel (watch the credits guy's, worth it).",

    "reviewTitle": "Entertaining popcorn flick it may be, but best superhero movie it is NOT!",
    "reviewBody": "INTRODUCTION After watching both Ironman movies, all Hulk movies, Thor and Captain America, watching Avengers is a sensible thing for me to do.WHAT'S HOT Great casts. Majority of them carry their parts well. Its nice to see all the familiar faces from previous movies.Great action scenes and impressive visual effects. The final New York scene is awesome. So many things to focus on, sensory overload! Ironman. On the field, Steve Rogers may be the unofficial leader of the team, but it is Tony Stark who performs most of the important, life-saving duties. The backbone of The Avengers.Scarlett Johansson and Cobie Smulders. Enuff said.WHAT'S NOT Loki. I understand that sometimes a couple of jokes here and there can be good, but when some of the jokes come from the result of the main villain being stupid, weak, being thrashed around, that's not good. What makes a good superhero movie is, among other things, the villain. His or her on-screen presence should instill fear, uncertainties, and in some ways, respect.Alien soldiers. There is no doubt that Ironman, Hulk, Thor and Capt America can kick aliens' ass anytime anyday, but Black Widow? Come on... I understand that this is a comic book movie, therefore any logic should be thrown out of the window, but Black Widow beating many alien soldiers without much difficulties is way too much. No doubt that she is a formidable fighter and can overcome many human opponents as we have seen in Ironman 2, but to be on the front line during an alien invasion is a no-no. She is more suitable for espionage, covert, intel-gathering, kind of duties.Black Widow. Same as above.Familiar story lines. Using a space portal to send alien soldiers and ships to attack earth? We have seen that in Transformers : Dark of The Moon. Huge alien attack craft that looks like 'fish'? Also seen that in the same Transformers! Destroying alien mothership using a nuclear warhead? Seen that in Independence Day.Police / Army. I know this movie is about a team of superheroes saving our world from alien invasion, but the apparent lack of support from the police and armies in fighting the aliens is so glaring. The freedom of 6 billion people under threat and yet you rely on less than 10 persons? The results are our heroes performing less important tasks such as saving civilians cornered by weak and easily defeatable alien soldiers (as evidenced by Black Widow) in a bank and rescuing people trapped in a bus! Delegate those things to the police, firemen, or ground troops, and focus on the bigger task of defeating Loki and closing the space portal.CONCLUSIONAn enjoyable movie. I had a good laugh on some of the scenes, mostly involving Hulk. In my opinion, The Dark Knight is still the best comic book movie, and maybe the title will go to The Dark Knight Rises in 2 months time.",

    "reviewBody": "The best superhero movie ever. Its entertaining, fresh, humorous and clever. All the superheros who appear in the film are fantastic, they are all included in the film equally so you don't really get the sense of a main character which is good.Captain America was awesome, he takes leadership of the team during the end fight scene which is really cool, we see him really kick some ass in this film but I felt his costume looked a little rubbish compared to his original costume in 'Captain America'.Thor didn't fail to impress, his costume was awesome but would of liked to of seen him wear his helmet in both the avengers and his own film like he does in the comics. His fight scene with Hulk was crazy, so good!!! Iron Man was awesome, he provided witty sarcasm that lightened the mood, he had some incredible action scenes and the special effects of his costume attaching itself to him in mid air was incredible.I didn't think after watching the film that the Hulk would be my favorite character but he was, the film really changed when the Hulk was unleashed, he was destructive and powerful and was a force to be reckoned with in the film. The fight scene between him and Loki was hilarious! (well if you call it fighting, it was more like hulk playing with a toy) Black Widow was wicked, had some bad ass fighting moves which contributed to the film massively. And she was super hot! And had some kick ass fight scenes.I didn't really think the movie needed Hawkeye but I was wrong, he was a really cool addition to the film and featured in the storyline massively and had some awesome action scenes at the end. I didn't think there was ever going to be a superhero movie which rivaled that of 'The Dark Knight' but there is and its called 'Avengers Assemble'!!!!!",

Even the laughter to the on screen repartee turned synchronous. Avid readers of the Marvel series would deem that justice had been done to the characters. The scenes where Tony Stark didn't get along with the rest of the superheroes were filled with comic relief. I for one wasn't exactly a fan of Captain America before watching this movie, though I had seen him in action in the Spiderman and his amazing friends show, he wasn't as impressive as the people would deem the first ever superhero would be, but the Avengers movie gave me a whole new perspective to the character. The final scenes had people gasping in shock and awe as to whether Tony Stark would survive And the phone call Jarvis made to Pepper Potts had everyone on the edge of their seats.. Avengers- A must Watch!!",

Not one second of this movie was disappointing, it was incredible, funny the action was incredible. I love Robert Downey, he as iron man is excellent, but I'm pleased to say that The Hulk stole the show. I really recommend this film not just to people who like this type of film but anyone who enjoys all type of film. It's awesome, just are black widow in that suit!! All of the characters get great screen time, and all of them feel in place, no one is left out and the character development is something to congratulate Whedon on. This film has everything in it, and I was so surprised by the humour because it wasn't cheesy, it was well done and clever, I look forward to the sequel! I do however feel sorry for Nolan, for his film should be overshadowed by this film, in fact all films this year should be. I might just go see it again. All of you should, such an achievement, credit Joss Whedon...bravo. And now that I have put spoilers, just wanna say, Hulk Vs Loki was one of the greatest scenes ever. Just pay to watch that scene and that merely will be worth the money.",

The aliens are supposed to be powerful, but they die just with 1 gunshot. I was waiting for the moment \"Loki vs. AVENGERS\". It never happened. The avengers just surrounded him and he surrendered.The movie has very good special effects, explosions, etc. but i expected something different. I LIKED THE MOVIE BUT IT COULD HAD BEEN MUCH BETTER",

    "reviewTitle": "Stunningly Intense, Emotional, Likable and Funny!",
    "reviewBody": "Saw it yesterday with my nephews and niece and enjoyed it more than any other Marvel adaptation since Spiderman.I can't think of any other recent film that could make this granite-faced 39 year old crack a grin at its moments of old-fashioned super-heroic \"awesome!\", such as when Captain America intervenes at the last moment to save a brave civilian from being vapourised, or simply watching a succession of childhood heroes duke it out with many a \"THOOM!\" and a \"WHAM!\" Yes, this film taps into our need for larger than life heroes, while at the same time making them likable by allowing us to laugh at them: Captain America is super-strong, brave and handsome, but probably wouldn't know how to use a computer mouse. Thor, aka \"PointBreak\", wears his mother's drapes. The Hulk is a dangerously powerful toddler in torn shorts.I even preferred Tony Stark in this one than his own films: somehow his wisecracking arrogance is much more impressive when it's at the expense of demi-gods and superhumans! With the tactical prowess of Captain A., the director has managed to get each character to play an equal part in their own special way, while providing a lot of fun and interest in the way they interact, whether they're cooperating or otherwise.When a film's heroes are near invincible it can be hard to induce a sense of jeopardy, but this film succeeds in doing that by providing an unexpected event which also lends a strong emotional core. We are also shown that our heroes can bleed: in 2 effective moments I remember there is a pause, we see that a hero is badly injured, but he carries on without complaint.Such is the goodwill fostered by the film, I'm prepared to skim over the negatives. I'd have preferred the gathering of the team to be hastened on a bit, and I think one stunt pulled by the Black Widow seemed more believably suited to a super-powered being, which was unnecessary as her more \"down to earth\" abilities were already enough to prove that she was a valuable part of the team.After we emerged from the cinema, we were all still pretty stunned from the intensity of the action. The verdict of my companions? The film rendered the life of my 15 year old nephew complete; his 11 year old brother thought it was \"OK\", and my 7 year old niece was inspired to switch her favourite character from Thor to The Hulk.",

    "reviewTitle": "Surpasses \"Begins\" in every aspect!!!",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy \"The Dark Knight\" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.",

His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his \"I will always be remembered\" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio.

    "reviewBody": "We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",

    "reviewBody": "Well I wanted a Frank Miller style movie and I got one. Just got back from the Montpelier VT hosted premiere, presented by Senator Leahy and WB CEO Barry Meyer....Heath's haunting portrayal as the Joker was captivating; this is the wild, anarchist, and truly disturbed loon we've been waiting for. I'm glad they kept any concrete origin out and instead opted for explaining Joker's existence as a necessity to Gotham's order and control. From the Killing Joke' \"Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\" He wails on Bats in one scene with cane and knife, using the strength of a madman, contrasting sharply with Batman showing restraint just when you really think he might lose it.The development of Two-Face played out well, showing his transition from strong public leader Dent to the duality driven, obsessive Two-Face, raging against free will. I'm proud to report he didn't rob the 2nd Gotham Bank at 2pm on the 2nd of February.Batman/Bruce give us what we expect from where Batman Begins leaves him; as a very very busy vigilante. It is nice how little change he goes through as Bruce, against how detached he must become, and how far he must fall as the Batman.Other than that, cool gadgetry from Wayne R&D of course, almost all of it believable. Sonic suit, cell phone hacking- a glimpse of ORACLE? wait till you see the bat-bike show up --- (eruption of cheers)Hardly any confusing effects, stunts or fights. Well choreographed and executed.",

    "reviewTitle": "Batman at his best and beyond",
    "reviewBody": "Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to \"confront everything he believes\" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen.",

OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up",

What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible.",

    "reviewTitle": "If you only see one movie this summer yada yada yada...",
    "reviewBody": "Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: \"If you only see one movie this summer, this is it\". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.",

    "reviewTitle": "Is this is a Comic Book Movie?",
    "reviewBody": "Let me preface this comment by saying I'm not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy the genre if it's done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight Returns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a \"comic-book\". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot of comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. There's a certain level of cheese and immaturity associated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime.However, the question that kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was \"Is this really a comic-book movie?\" And I think that's no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to spring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when it's night, it's dark and when it's day it's light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and supervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the action is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing that's really \"comic-book\" about the movie is Batman's costume, which is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. It's all tied together with a rock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so intense I think it gave me heart palpitations).Certainly a risky move to pull in a film that's appealing to an audience that is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more credit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me.What I'm trying to say is this movie is good. It's so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of \"comic-book\" movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight lives up to the Hype and Exceeds even the Loftiest Expectations",
    "reviewBody": "Since the first time I saw 'The Dark Knight' teaser attached to 'Knocked Up' last spring, I couldn't stop thinking about the film. With unprecedented hype and speculation, the latest Batman adaption has created the loftiest expectations for millions of people (fanboys and moviegoers alike); myself included.After seeing an advanced screening of 'The Dark Knight', I can honestly say: 'The Dark Knight' is amazing.'The Dark Knight' left me breathless. 'The Dark Knight' is the best Batman movie to date. Christopher Nolan's latest film, without a single doubt, dethrones Tim Burton's 'Batman' and his own 'Batman Begins'. It's immense, unpredictable, and believable. Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' transcends the \"superhero\" genre.The IMAX format is absolutely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and go see 'The Dark Knight' in IMAX if available to you. There were moments during the picture where the IMAX-specific sequences left me speechless. It was unreal. It made the cinema-experience that much better (though I'm nearly positive that IMAX or not, you'll still love this film!)The last thing I'd like to mention is the wonderful acting in 'The Dark Knight'; specifically Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman. Their respective performances were uncanny. Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is outstanding and deserves the praise he's been receiving from many early reviews. Eckhart is excellent and showcases his multi-talented abilities through the movie; I believe in Harvey Dent. Oldman's role as Jim Gordon was a personal favorite of mine, and I left the theater in amazement. To avoid spoiling anything to you, I must admit to you that my review is only scratching the surface. I loved this movie! Great work; Great film.",

    "reviewBody": "There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation. Star Wars, The Godfather, Jaws and now, The Dark Knight. A cinematic masterpiece, the films 2 and a half hours are both too short, yet so immersing it seems like days. Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included. The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense, explosive action sequences. The acting was also unbelievable; Between Heath Ledger's tour de force (which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz), Aaron Eckhart's tragic Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Gary Oldman's ever brilliant presence as Lt. James Gordan, and Christian Bale's intense and driven Batman/Bruce Wayne, everyone involved is absolutely stellar. However, what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is, is the story. Truly epic in it's scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it. This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff, this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular. Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did.",

    "reviewBody": "I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of this rejuvenated franchise. That movie was smooth and exciting throughout. I'll try not to be too specific since the film hasn't been released yet.First, I'll tell you why it was good. Bale and Ledger didn't disappoint. There has been a lot of buzz about Heath's performance being his best (it's so easy to say nice things about an actor once they have died). He actually was fantastic as the Joker. I don't know if he was better than Nicholson, but he was different. You can't compare the two. Bale's darker side of Batman was great. The action and effects were gripping. The score fit the scenes flawlessly too.Now the problems. I started looking at my watch after an hour and a half...and I continued looking at it for a full hour. The movie was choppy and didn't flow very well. I'm a bright person, but parts of it were hard to follow. 45 minutes easily could have been edited. This movie did not need to be 2 1/2 hours.I recommend seeing it, but you'll be exhausted after from excitement and boredom.",

It is a little long, at 2 1/2 hours. But the story is very intelligently crafted, and I don't see how it could have been cut.Some of the scenes are dark, just like the title would suggest. I don't think its a spoiler to say that clever camera work was used to avoid showing some violence. But there is still some disturbing violence suggested, and there are some disturbing images.

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made",
    "reviewBody": "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film \"Batman Begins,\" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for Smoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.",
    "reviewBody": "I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.",

    "reviewTitle": "Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait",
    "reviewBody": "I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!",

We all knew, following the tragic and untimely passing of Heath Ledger, that the buzz around this film would spiral beyond control... but I was pleasantly surprised (well, maybe not too surprised) to find that the movie actually surpassed the hype. I went into the preview expecting a great movie, but got even more than that. The opening sequence grabs you, the pace of the action keeps you moving along (even for such a long movie), there's just enough (dark) humor mixed in to make the issues the characters face palatable and to make the characters more believable as human. I have just one very minor beef with this film- totally unrelated to plot or characters. Gotham, though fictional, has long been associated with a particular American city. I was kinda bummed to see the movie filmed in that Second city. Oh well. Still a great movie. I just watched in twice in a row, but just couldn't stay through a third screening. Not that it's not worth it- I will definitely see it again, but it's kinda long and I'm reeaallly tired, so, off the bed. I'm sure you will love this film.",

Yes Did Heath Ledger surprise viewers who have had people nibbling in their ear about his portrayal for months now? Definitely yes. The film pretty much succeeds everything it sets out to do, and that's a lot. An epic crime film that has the similar layered and extravagant plots of something like Inside Man, The Dark Knight is far from a typical superhero film. There are psychological character studies of the Jokers anarchic destruction, Harvey Dent's shining savior and last but far from least Batman's role as the Dark Knight, the man who is above and below everyone else to do what they won't. The discussions in the film about who Batman is really defined what the character is all about and when the words The Dark Knight concluded the film I completely understood it's meaning. This incarnation of Batman is also the darkest. While Burton opted for Gothic quality, Schumacher for colorful campyness, Nolan has decided on a gritty and unsettling look at Batman. The story is unbelievably tragic and while I won't say much the film has far from a happy ending. It may not be the most entertaining superhero flick out there but it's certainly the best.",

    "reviewBody": "I thought that this film was fantastic. From Ledgers unrecognizable and amazing performance of the joker(he embodied the character very well) to Christian Bale maintaining form from 'Begins'. Maggie G was an excellent choice for Rachael and did a far better job than Katie Holmes. Michael Caine as Alfred has great comic timing but knows how to play serious as well.Cillian Murphys small role in the film was a good decision by Nolan. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey/Two face was intense, he surpassed all expectations i had of his skill.Ledgers presence on screen is powerful and a little scary at times, but the slightly morbid jokes of his are perfect. He almost overshadows the entire film because he is just so insane on screen.My Favourite movie so far this year. RIP Ledger. Congratulations to Nolan for making such a fantastic movie.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Masterpiece",
    "reviewBody": "Set almost immediately after \"Begins\", The Dark Knight focuses on Batman's fight against the Joker, a criminal mastermind and mass murderer who is gathering all of Gotham's criminals under his banner. With the body count piling up, Batman, along with his close allies Lucius Fox (Freeman), Detective Gordon (Oldman), Harvey Dent (Eckhart) and his faithful butler Alfred (Caine), must bring the Joker to justice before he turns Gotham City inside out.This movie was perfect in almost every aspect. A solid script, great action sequences, suspense and well-portrayed characters, this movie definitely surpasses all the hype.The action sequences in DK were brilliant. They kept you on the edge of your seat with suspense and excitement. I myself almost fell off my seat wondering if Batman really was going to kill the Joker or spare him.The movie, however, is not just a movie about a Superhero. There were parts in this movie that i found interesting. Such as the scenes in which people's lives were placed in the hands of others. These scenes really help to investigate the dark side of the human mind and in some aspects, brings out the joker in all of us. This made this film more than just a Superhero film, but somewhat of a psychological thriller as well.The characters in this film were very well-portrayed. Maggie Gyllenhall's depiction of Rachel Dawes was interesting and definitely different from Katie Holmes'. She gave Dawes a stronger character in a way which was more suitable for this film as Rachel played a much bigger role. Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent. His performance was powerful and confident and portrayed Gotham's new hero as the kind of hero you would expect.However, best of all would be Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was creepy, disturbing and downright scary. It differed greatly from Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character, giving it the creepiness it needs to portray a psychotic mass murderer. He simply captures every scene and has the ability to either make us laugh or make us cringe.Overall, this movie not only lives up to the hype, it surpasses it. The Dark Knight is hands-down, the best Batman movie ever and maybe even the best comic-based film ever.",

    "reviewBody": "I have looked forward to this movie for about a year, and with it being my most anticipated movie ever, i was expecting a roller coaster ride of emotion, chaos and anarchy... I got it all and more.Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of brilliant. When he's on screen, hes amazing, and when he's off screen, you want him back. Thats how good he is in the film. I did however, think they could have had The Joker in the film a bit more.Christian Bale is very good as Batman, but tries a bit too hard on the Bruce Wayne character. Maggie gyllenhaul is better than Katie Holmes period, although she wasn't as involved in the crime fighting as Katie Holmes' was.Aaron Eckhart was a perfect choice for Harvey Dent, and you could tell throughout the film that he had a dark side, especially when he had a few angry outbursts at Gordon and Batman.In conclusion, I've never seen a film travel so fast, considering its a 2.5 hour movie. It fells like 1.5 hours!! It is very well written with many memorable quotes..The highlights for me in the film were: The Joker's meeting with the mob bosses, and for that split second when Gamble calls him crazy - Joker's reply is priceless!! The Bat Pod chase to the Joker was amazing, along with the hospital scene with a bit of dark comedy..Ledger carried this film, and without him, i wouldn't have the satisfaction i have now for this great film, SEE THIS FILM NOW!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Terrible",
    "reviewBody": "Wow... Words cannot even describe how incredibly awful this movie was.  The acting was poor, mediocre at best, (yes, that is including Heath  Ledger's supposedly \"oscar-worthy\" performance as the Joker) the plot  was simply terrible and amazingly uneven, as if no one had bothered to  make a final edit. It is one of the slowest and most boring movies I  have ever seen, I have never walked out of a movie before but I was  highly tempted with this mess, checking my watch every few minutes  before the one hour mark in what ended up being a two and a half hour  movie that seemed oh so much longer. I found that the best part of the  film was when the credits started rolling. Whilst Michael Bay's  blockbuster movies are terrible, at least they are somewhat  entertaining. Sadly, I cannot say the same for \"The Dark Knight.\"  Ignore all the hype and don't be fooled by the trailers which suggest  this may be a good film - This movie was plain terrible, a complete  train wreck. 1/10",

    "reviewTitle": "The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted",
    "reviewBody": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",

    "reviewTitle": "Heath Ledger is a ledgend!",
    "reviewBody": "Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!",

Heath Ledger is brilliant, and it's sad that he won't keep going on in his career. Aaron Eckhart is also brilliant and has been forgiven by me. The rest of the cast plays there parts including Gary Oldman who has actually done some of his best work in history. Christian Bale well he's Christian Bale enough said.The movie itself is hand down one of the best of the year, maybe the decade. It pulls you down, gives you no rhyme or reason, and only at the very end do you see a little light.Anyways enough of me, go see the movie, and expect to be changed.",

His Joker is destined for movie legend and greatness. Peter Travers in the Rolling Stone wrote that '. If there's a movement to get him (Heath Ledger) the first posthumous Oscar since Peter Finch won for 1976's Network, sign me up.\" I concur entirely.

Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree. All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.10/10 rating...well done",

Anyway, the film is by far the darkest superhero film I have ever seen.Heath Ledger did excellent in his chilling portrayal of The Joker, every scene he was in brought a mix of dark humor and scariness to the table. Micheal Caine, Gary Oldman & Christan Bale also did quite well.Onto the bulk of the film, I felt the movie was going great up until the hospital blew up, from that point on some very unneeded action scenes took place. The film would have been MUCH better if they just went to the final scene and cut out the boat bit.The length was also a factor, many scenes could and should have been cut.Overall, this is a dark and depressing superhero flick with some excellent performances, but it falls apart a bit in the final act. 8.5/10 I liked Begins more.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Triumph of a crime film (not just a simple comic book movie)",
    "reviewBody": "I was just afforded the opportunity to watch the newest batman installment The Dark Knight but not only did i get to lay my eyes upon a Nolan gift to the world, I saw it at 12.00pm and school was back in session.So without the constant ramblings of minors or the reverberating sounds of popcorn crunching I was allowed to fully appreciate what had been put to the screen.To say i was elated with the finished result is an enormous understatement but it is also something that does not come on like a flood. Some scenes once begun can seem like a simply and brainless action flick as \"spiderman\" is asked to chose someone's fate but the conclusion of each scene leaves you stunned as if you have just come to the twist in fight club and no one has spoiled the ending.It does not take much thought to see that this is a good film, but soon after the movie whilst you are sipping on your Mocha or catching the train home as I did, that you realise this is a great film. Morals are questioned and lines are crossed and these are all beautifully created by the Nolan brothers.They may not have the odd brilliance of the Coens or the VFX beauty of the Wachowski's but this brother duo are the new force to be reckoned with in theatre. The title says crime film and I stand by that notion because what the Nolan's put to screen is not a comic-book PG blockbuster. Within minutes you feel like you are watching another crime thriller even though the protagonist is dressed in a black Kevlar suit and the antagonist dolled up like a two-dollar hooker.The action/story is fast-paced and the editing very edgy throughout fight scenes keeping that sense that we are all just blind as bats as he moves amongst us.And now onto the performances, Without doubt one of Ledger best characters and I know that the former statement is already echoing like a poor cliché but it can be justified. It was not so much as what he said in the movie that evoked my 'endearment' but what he left to his body. His jerky movements and twitches as he almost seems uncomfortable in the trappings of his human body and then when he does open his mouth it amplifies everything that his body tells you. It is so easy to forget that this is in fact Heath Ledger, the man who sang to Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, he simply is not himself and you can feel just how much he put into his performance because you truly believe that this man is mad.It goes unsaid that Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain both dominate in their particular roles especially in the case of Cain as he is given some wonderful dialog, which he delivers with perfect tone absolutely stealing the scene from anyone he is accompanying.Bale again shows the world what a real batman should be; torn, misguided, hopeful and terrifying but the one role that truly stood out in the film was that of Gary Oldman. Long gone is the sympathetic innocence we saw of his character in Batman Begins, as he gives rise to a powerful Gordon and a character that really belongs in Nolan's envisioning of Gotham. As i watched each scene with Oldman I thought that i was watching the likes of Keitel or Spacey, he took every opportunity to prove himself as a great actor and in each scene he intimidates the audience with his power.The main factor behind the re-birth of the Batman franchise is believability, Gone are the glo-paint and mo-hawks as the Nolan's give a haunting image of a world, our world, riddled with corruption in it's darkest hours before the dawn.Without hesitation i give this movie 10 stars as it is beautifully shot, encouragingly directed, impressively written and memorably performed. This sets a new standard for the comic-book movie, I wonder who can step up to the plate?",

    "reviewTitle": "It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close.",
    "reviewBody": "No words can quite aptly describe the dark, sinuous genius of Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\". A sequel to the 2005 \"Batman Begins\", the film defies the industry cliché of being a shameless exploitation of a franchise. Much has already been said about Heath Ledger's electric performance as the demented Joker and little else can really be said. It's a performance that displays every psychological tic with sadistic glee and Ledger, virtually unrecognisable behind both the makeup and the mannerisms, imbues his character with terrifying insanity.Of course, Ledger is just one of the many gems in a fine cast. Christian Bale is predictably good in the titular role but he's overshadowed by some other key players. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman but it's Aaron Eckhart who gives a truly amazing performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's idealistic DA and the city's moral centre. Eckhart's innocuous golden boy looks belie his dramatic finesse and he conveys the duality of Harvey's character and ideals with great deft.The high calibre of the cast is reason enough to go see the movie but it's the screenplay, written by the Nolan Brothers, that allows \"The Dark Knight\" to become more than just an adequate sequel. For all the cartoonish connotations of its comic book origins, the movie is a rich and fascinating study into the machinations of justice and humanity. In a genre of such formulaic conventions where \"doomed romance\" and \"final showdown\" are automatically entrenched in the storyline to inspire the same old message and emotions, it's hard to find some new ground. \"The Dark Knight\" succeeds, however, in toying with these very conventions and while the message that it sends is as subtle as an anvil crashing on your head, it's surprisingly powerful. Say what you will about the hype and about the free publicity that Ledger's death has earned this film but to credit it's commercial or critical success so cynically would do both the actor and this film an injustice. At the end of the day, \"The Dark Knight\" is brilliant entertainment with some phenomenal performances.It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close.",

    "reviewBody": "I was looking forward to this, I'm a fan of comic book movies and I like when they delve into the psyche of the hero, aka Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins, and this didn't disappoint. I actually had trouble remembering this was a comic book movie. It gets very in-depth and doesn't pull any punches. Action, storyline, effects, mood, everything is very well done, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, waiting to see what's gonna happen next. Normally I have trouble sitting through a film that's more than 2 hours long but I was sorry when this finished.I've been a fan of Heath's since Two Hands and his tragically cut-short development as an actor since then definitely shines through in this. You can tell he put his heart and soul into this and while his death certainly adds to the hype there's no doubt he does amazingly well with a very disturbed Joker. His performance is pretty much flawless and his presence on screen is palpable. The voice, mannerisms and just his general menacing aura definitely hit the mark and will do his memory justice for years to come. It's a pity he won't get the chance to reprise his role but I'm glad he went out on such a high note. Baille is excellent but almost takes a second fiddle in this film, don't get me wrong it's still very much about Batman but the other characters are so developed and well done. Eckhart is great, Caine and Freeman are always good and Maggie Gyllenhaal does her job well. Gary Oldman is one of my favourites, he is one of those actors that can pretty much assimilate into any role and this is no different. I'd say aside from Heath he's the best thing about this film in terms of acting, his naturalness and talent are apparent every time he's on screen.Hats off to Nolan, he's done a great job (again). After the incredible disappointment of Indiana Jones, I'm happy to say this is the best film I've seen so far this year.",

    "reviewBody": "A lot of people here on IMDb are going to be rating this film 10 out of 10 claiming that it is the best film ever in the history of cinema. While the film is not _that_ good, it is still a great experience that manages to keep the audience immersed in it's unpredictable story line and tight action sequences.The Dark Knight, the first Batman film not to have \"Batman\" in the title, takes place after the events of the last film \"Batman Begins\". Crime in the city has fallen drastically ever since Batman (Christian Bale) started roaming the streets and made the police pull their act together, but this progress starts to become undone when an insane anarchist dubbing himself \"The Joker\" (Heath Ledger) comes into the scene. What follows is a tight story control vs. chaos as Batman and the Jokers ideals clash in increasingly violent ways. The plot veers and turns as The Joker and his crew continuously create increasingly dangerous diabolical complicated schemes for Batman and the police to thwart, and all the while the film constantly strives for realism by trying to make the events that take place as plausible as possible, and is delivered with utterly seriousness dark attitude more along the lines of a good crime drama than a stereotypical superhero movie.Since Batman and the other characters from the previous film are largely the same as they were last time around, I'll get to the man we all came to see: The Joker. While Heath Ledger's Joker doesn't top Jack Nicholson's from Batman 89 (because let's face it, who ever could?), Ledger does provide an immensely interesting take on the character. It is probably not fair to compare the two actors seeing as they both do completely different approaches to the character; where Nicholson's Joker was an egotistical, narcissistic psychopath, Ledger's Joker is a schizophrenic, sadistic anarchist. And believe me, The Joker in this film really does play off the anarchist factor. Here we have a man who wants nothing else but to see the world collapse, and the only reason he wants it is just for the very reason of seeing the world collapse. He is jumpy, twitchy, intimidating, and gives off the vibe that he could flip out at any moment for the smallest reason, or even no reason. He spends the whole film scaring, bullying and murdering people, just because it somehow makes sense in his twisted mind, and he feels no fear, remorse or guilt whenever Batman or anyone else tries to \"punish\" him. He's just dangerous, truly the Batman's arch nemesis; Batman hates everything about him, and the Joker loves making Batman hate him.District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the other big newcomer to the story, and while anybody who knows anything about his character from the previous installments in the Batman franchise already knows his end, he is probably the most well rounded and three dimensional character in the film. You can really get to feel his motivations, and seeing his rise and fall from power is really interesting.And for the more superficial out there, I will say the action scenes in the film are wonderfully choreographed, and the use of stunt men and practical effects over computer generated ones the majority of the time really does make for some exciting fight scenes.The film is not without flaws though, the two biggest that come to mind are the films fast pace and ending. Granted, the film is nearly three hours long, but it still feel like the creators tired to tell too much story in too little time. If someone walked in 5 minutes late for this film, they would have already missed about 50 plot points. Granted that is an exaggeration, but it's still true that the movie constantly jumps between set piece and set piece, skimming along to the next action scene, where it would have been nice to spend a few minutes here or there get to know characters better and establish mood. This isn't to say the movie doesn't spend time doing this at all, no, but it still would have been beneficial to pad out the movie a little more. This fact becomes apparent with the ending. Without giving away anything, I will say the ending of the film, while still satisfying, does sneak up out of nowhere and abruptly bring the film to an end, leaving you saying, \"Uhh... Don't you have a little bit more you want to show us?\".That and Batman's voice does get a little try hard.So while many will get wrapped up in the hype that surrounds the film and prematurely denote this films the \"Best Movie Ever Made In The Universe\" award where it probably does not deserve it, the movie does manage to deliver to an audience member looking for a fun experience and tight storytelling. It's not a masterpiece, but it is a great movie.",

Its highly enjoyable through the entire two and a half hour run time.It must be said that Heath Ledger does steal every scene and you are just waiting for him to pop back into the movie when he is not in it. Everything blends really well together from the cast to the music to the shots. It really is a great movie experience.There are a few small details of this movie that bother me. Just because the bring the movie back into comic book land and not a crime drama. Most of them towards the end.I also recommend that it should be scene on an IMAX screen because it makes the movie absolutely breathtaking. It is the best movie this year and should merit some Oscar consideration at the very least a Best Supporting nod to Mr. Ledger he truly is the joker.",

I'm not suggesting they'll be scarred for life, but don't let the action figures and kids' meals fool you - this movie feels real and it's one of the darkest I've seen in a long time.

    "reviewBody": "I was lucky enough to take an early afternoon off work and catch this film at the Melbourne IMAX. After downloading and watching the HD teaser (opening 5 minutes of the film) off of Demonoid I knew I had to go see it. Who ever said file sharing hurt Hollywood in the box office sales? Pfft.I'm sure this film would still be as exciting on a regular cinema screen but like someone else said: if you've got the choice go see it at IMAX. Some of the aerial cinematography really blew me away in all it's full high-def glory.Earlier, I was reading a review where the critic was saying the film was slow to start but that's a load of BS in my opinion. I reckon it started at about 7 on the adrenalin gauge and cranked it up from there. All the performances were surprisingly authentic for a big budget Hollywood film. Heath Ledger WAS the Joker...no wonder he was disturbed by taking on such a psychologically deranged character.Anyhow, fans of the series will be able to comment more authoritatively on how well the movie does justice to the Batman saga. I'm simply writing this from the perspective of someone who enjoys seeing an action film from time to time, and no doubt - The Dark Knight delivers. Word!",

    "reviewBody": "Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema, and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you 'That was the coolest flipping movie I ever saw!'The Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece. It builds itself up so many times, only to turn around and take you in another direction. Heath Ledger's much hyped performance lived up to all expectations, being both chilling, yet horrifyingly captivating. Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world, and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance, and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with. The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the film's star. Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger, why this is, I am not sure. The performance of the cast is, as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable. Old hands Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and grace to the screen, while the new kids on the block (Gyllenhaal, Bale, and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart) truly knock it out of the park.If you miss out on this film, you truly are missing out, it is a modern classic.

    "reviewTitle": "A masterpiece - Likely to constitute a serious indictment on the Oscar system...",
    "reviewBody": "First things first.This film is not a comic book movie. It is not an action movie. To reduce it to these archetypes would be completely unfair.To fairly represent this movie it must be seen for what it is - It is a dramatic suspense film that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the surprisingly long running time (surprising in that it goes by so fast, and also that the studio allowed Christoper Nolan to cut it this long) Batman Begins was seen by most to be a triumph in the comic adaptation genre. However, it did remain a comic adaptation in many ways.The Dark Knight goes beyond that. This film blows suspense up to a city-wide level, and raises the stakes to a breathtaking level. It recalls the suspenseful nature of films by the likes of David Fincher, Ridley Scott, and even the master, Alfred Hitchcock.It's crafted in such a way that each action seems both inevitable and unbelievable, and so even for fans of the comic book who believe they know where it is going, it is an astounding achievement.The film looks spectacular, thanks to Nolan's regular cinematographer Wally Pfister. Gotham city looks brighter, yet more ominous during the day, and danker and more dangerous at night.The performances are as spectacular as many had expected and/or hoped. Bale returns in fine form as the titular character, and can't be faulted too much. Eckhart debuts as District Attorney Harvey Dent, and the storyline effectively revolves around him and his war on organised crime in Gotham. There are fine supporting performances from the returning Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, as well as the newcomers Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell and Maggie Gyllenhaal (who thankfully takes over from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes).However, if the action centres on Harvey Dent, then the action IS Heath Ledger's performance as the maniacal Joker. In one of the finest film performances of the last decade, Ledger puts in what will end up being an unforgettable final (complete) performance that will have almost everyone buzzing about a potential posthumous Academy Award.I cannot reiterate enough - Not only is this film excellent, and highly enjoyable to watch, but it is of such a fine quality that it should really transcend the typical box created for films that are deemed to not contain the correct \"subject matter\". Much in the way Rocky transcended the typical \"sports movie\", so this transcends the typical \"comic book movie\" - It is much more than that, and should legitimately be considered come Oscar season. If this movie cannot earn some consideration by the Academy, they might as well come out and call them the Academy Awards for slow-paced, moody dramas, because this is the best film I have seen in a long time, and that's including the crop that were nominated for best picture last year.In short, go see this movie. If you, or your friends, or anyone you know has been excited about this movie to come out, then just know that everything that they were excited for is justified.Go see it - You'll enjoy it, because it's terrific. There's not much more to say.",

Gone are the cartoony colors, the cheesy villains, the bat nipples. The Dark Knight is just that, Dark. in fact, it I have only one criticism it would be that it isn't pretty enough. The photography is gritty, and dark and lit with cold lighting. But its effective. Speaking of awards, Heath Ledger deserves an Academy Award for his re-invention of The Joker. It's really tragic that he won't be around to enjoy the fruits of his labor. This movie will propel him to cult status. His Joker is demented. Twisted. Outright evil. I loved how he made a pencil disappear in his introduction scene. You'll understand when you see it. And you'll love the stories he comes up with on \"how he got those scars.\" Another award should be given for the \"makeup\" on Two Face. Although it isn't makeup, it's the most horrific and haunting face you will ever see. Very ghastly, yet again, very effective. The movie does an amazing job of telling of his downward spiral. It is long, at 2 hours and 30 minutes, but it does leave you wanting more. (in a good way). It's really two movies in one. At one point when you think things are winding down to a finale, it's just getting warmed up. And when it is finally over, it isn't. There WILL be a sequel. And I'm in line already to see it.",

    "reviewBody": "I am a batman fan. Not a fanboy mind you, I have read the comics, seen the other films, and like batman story well enough, but unlike a few of my friends, I haven't been following the release for this movie like a bloodhound. But thanks to above mentioned friends, I have been passively looking forward to it. So we booked our tickets, got to one of the first showings in the world (I live in Australia) and got ready to see a movie that could not possibly live up to the hype that has engulfed the world. I was so wrong, so, so wrong. This film stands so far above its predecessor it is on another planet. Nolans script is, like most of his movies, a complex and involving one. Unlike his some of his other films, the acting, story, cinematography etc all belong on the same pedestal. Never before have I felt the palm sweaty excitement of a gripping film take hold of me for a complete running time (and keep in mind this is 2 and half hours). The lack of CGI is one of the films biggest assets. The action feels gritty and real, involving you more than the graphics heavy iron man or Hulk ever did.Id heard talk of Ledger being nominated for a posthumous Oscar but had thought it a silly move, why give awards to someone who cannot accept it? But his performance is mind blowing, creating one of the best villains ever to grace the screen. I don't know if an Oscar is the right way to do it, but his performance needs to be acknowledged for the masterpiece it is. Id heard a critic call this the \"empire strikes back\" of superhero films, and it really is the perfect comparison. This film proves that some \"superhero\" movies don't belong in a little niche, to be weighed against each other, not the \"serious\" films, but can instead be acclaimed as deep, involving and above all exciting works of film-making.",

They are absolutely right. This is a an intelligent, dark film, far removed from the neon colours and slanty buildings of the Burton-era films. This is certainly not a \"kids\" superhero movie, it deserves the M rating it received here. It's a thought-provoking and subtle the film explores the Dark Knight as a vigilante, not a hero. A force of good that needs the opposite force of evil to exist. The scenes between Batman and the Joker are fantastic and riveting.

Also all other actors were just as amazing. Christian Bale is of course awesome. Christopher Nolan, you are a legend!!! What a director!!!Now, be warned. This is a longer batman version. So be prepared to stay in a little longer than you expect. But when everything said and done, The Dark Knight is an Oscar-worthy film and should be praised and will be praised for a very long time.

It does stretch a little though, feeling a little like they've squeezed two films into one in order to give all the characters the room they need to develop until each one reaches their ultimate fate. An Australian reviewer recently commented it didn't feel that long despite being almost 3 hours long - guess what, it was only 2 hours and 20 minutes! Unfortunately, in Australia we tend to have to sit through half an hour of ads before the feature begins.I digress. Heath Ledger was excellent, channeling Jack Lemmon on demonic form with just a hint of surfer dude still there, particularly when in one scene late in the film he reveals a tanned arm. The only negative I would give is this film's hangover from the previous films in the series and the persistence of Batman's booming graveling voice.

    "reviewBody": "I went to see this movie with fairly high hopes that it was going to be a pearler. All the trailers looked good, the press were raving about Heath's portrayal of the Joker, and most of all it was a Batman movie. A character i had grown up with watching on TV. While this movie, like the previous title Batman Begins takes a big leap away from what everyone except the Batman comic book lovers have seen. It lands solidly on a firm ground made up of fans who are going to find this movie an absolute joy.Christian Bale is back as the Batman and he works just as hard as he did in the last movie to bring that character to life. He plays Bruce Wayne down to a tea and his aggressiveness and ability to fight Shine through the big black suit. His voice, while some call it too strained and annoying as Batman I find fitted the role well. This is not the Batman we are used to seeing. But I hope to see a lot more of it.Heath's acting in this movie is unlike anything i have ever seen before. Both he and Director Christopher Nolan have done an amazing job with the character. Never has a character made me feel afraid, horrified, confused then had me laughing in hysterics all in the space of 10 seconds. At times he truly is a horrifying figure to watch, then he switches to to a lunatic you cant help but laugh at. They have managed to truly capture what the Joker really is in this movie. A dangerously insane human being.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/2 face. His performance was also excellent. You could sense the frustration within Harvey's character in his fight to clean Gotham City of the mob families and the Joker. Yet there was such a change in character once the transition from one to the other took place. And he did it superbly. I look forward to seeing this character develop.Other notable performances were Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni and a small role by William Fichtner as the bank manager (But I'm just a fan of whatever he does :) ) Overall the film is a monster coming in at a runtime of 2 hours 32 minutes. But in no way do you feel it. The movie manages to stay fresh and vibrant throughout. The action comes at you fast and intense and there is plenty of it. All in all this film will surpass any hype you have seen or heard about it. Its worthy of any awards it or its actors are nominated for.",

It contains the dark and strong elements of Gotham City while still giving you the intricate detail of characters and this adds to the epic feeling of the film.A must see for all movie lovers though I wouldn't take anyone under thirteen to see it as they would not fully appreciate the depth and true understanding of human nature found in this film.",

Once we got passed the undercover cops with night vision goggles and got to out seats 'The Dark Knight' didn't disappoint... Well not too much anyway.With all the hype about Heath Ledger was it as good as everyone talked about? Heath's performance was fantastic. He was creepy, insane and the close ups was where he really shined. He had this quirk where he kept licking his lips. There is a wonderful part of the movie that will make you laugh and shudder at the same time. We'll leave it as The Joker dressed as a woman.Personally I think his performance is up there with all the hype, but does he deserve an Oscar? I'd say he'd be high up there. Unfortunately we'll never know if he deserves it on his acting ability or his death. This was his best performance.Christian Bale, Gyllenhaal and Freeman all played there parts well, but they all just seemed like a fill in for when the Joker wasn't on screen.Gary Oldman was great and Aaron Eckhart shone as Harvey Dent. I actually thought we'd see him transform at the end and he'd be used in the next movie. It was a nice surprise to see his alter ego come out. He did look like terminator though.The movie was fun, dark and I didn't expect it to end the way it did. I came out a little disappointed that I'd never see Heath again and also felt a little underdone with Christian Bale in the movie.Heath simply steals the show as the joker you'll be left wanting more.Sadly the movie as a whole almost felt like a fill in for an even bigger sequel.",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing",
    "reviewBody": "This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is much more than just a summer blockbuster or another comic book movie (all though it fits as both of those as well). It's really a lesson in storytelling, sharp and crisp dialog, story arcs, camera direction... every aspect of film really.One thing that usually bothers me in movies (comic movies and otherwise) is the main characters need to have a romantic relationship just because. I even felt this way in Batman Begins. In this movie however the triangle between Wayne, Dent and Dawes serves multiple purposes and helps to drive the film.This movie grabs you from scene one, minute one and doesn't let go the entire time. It is a roller coaster ride better than any I've ridden on with huge drops and more twists and turns than you'll be able to keep track of. It's not that there's a big \"oh my god\" moment (alla sixth sense) but there's enough smaller scale twists to keep you readily engaged.Heath's performance is as good as everyone is saying and the Joker in this film is far creepier than that in the original Batman film. What I don't think is talked about enough is Eckhart's performance and Harvey Dent which is just spot on and extraordinarily powerful. It makes you hope that people like this exist in the world and you can't help but believe in him as much as Rachel, Wayne and the Citizens of Gotham do.This is a movie you most certainly will want to see on the big screen and you'll want to see it as soon as possible. There are things in the movie that people could spoil for you and I guarantee you that people won't be able to not talk about this film, it's just too good.The plot is not so much Batman vs. The Joker (all though there is plenty of that). It's really more about Batman against Batman. Does Gotham really need him? Does he make things worse? Can he ever stop? Can he have a \"real\" relationship? Can he count on his friends? Can Gotham survive without him? All of these things and more are answered in The Dark Knight.",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is rightfully called that. It's not a Batman movie, either is it a Superhero movie. It's a character film. Honestly, it should be called \"Harvey Dent, as told by the Joker\". It's about three characters; each dealing with heroism in their own way. It's one of the most unpretentiously complex movies to be released in recent years.The incredible acting across the board stunned me: Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllanaal, Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart all give the performances of their lives.This is an amazing film, and will stand the test of time as one of the greats. Nolan is to be commended for his incredible vision.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply Excellent",
    "reviewBody": "I left the theater in a state of disbelief and awe that such a masterpiece of a performance was still present in today's Hollywood churned movies.The Dark Knight is by far the best movie and it ranks up there with the Godfather in the critically acclaim department.Christopher Nolan has managed to surpass the his incredible work in Batman Begins with another superb storyline that just grips and pull your heartstrings. He manages to get the audience to sympathize with Batman's plight and the Gotham City that is portrayed is so realistic that you would be forgiven that if you thought it was real.The brilliant cast turned out splendid individual performances and they really portrayed their characters with so much emotion that is lacking in today's movies. However, the Oscar nomination and possibly a win should go to Heath Ledger who nailed the role as the Joker. He played the role so well that I felt so terrified that such a criminal could exist. In other words, it was just breath -taking to watch Heath.Dark Knight is much more than a simple summer blockbuster. It tells the struggle of good over evil and that sometimes you can either be the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.",

    "reviewTitle": "The perfect film",
    "reviewBody": "If you're going to the The Dark Knight expecting a comic book movie or an action hero you might be disappointed because that's not what Christopher Nolan has created here. This is an extremely well-written film, with characters that pose social and psychological questions. It is also, in my opinion, the film with the best villain ever - The Joker. Even with all the hype you've heard about this, I can't begin to describe how blown away I was by Heath Ledger's performance. The cinematography couldn't have been better and it literally is a dark film. Hans Zimmer's contribution to this film was amazing. As always, he manages to create such unique music that perfectly fits this movie. Michael Cain's performance fits perfect within the movie. Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to see on screen and he always brings a breath of fresh air to this intense film. Gary Oldman's talent needs no further praise, since he has proved on many occasions what a great actor he is.To be honest, I can't imagine why someone wouldn't like this film. If you're looking for action, you're going to get it. If you're looking for great acting, it doesn't really get any better. If you're a comic book fan, you'll thank Christopher Nolan for showing you new things about you favorite character. And if you're just going to the movies, I repeat, this is a great script, this is storytelling at its best. The only reason why you might not like this movie is if you got used to the highway chasing, car exploding, \"multi-talented\" - Michael Bay. Actually, Dark Knight has chase scenes as well, but here, they're part of the story, they're not just there for the sake of blowing up some cars. Explosions, another well-explored matter by the \"great\" Michael Bay... Dark Knight has explosions, hell, the one they shot in London got the locals calling the police to report a terrorist act. BUT the difference is, Dark Knight is about story and character, the visual effects (which are mind blowing) are there to support this.I hope you all enjoy The Dark Knight as much as I did.",

I use the word \"may\", but who knows, this is only the opinion of one person.I honestly left after the film not knowing what rating I could give it, its still muddled in my mind how much I actually liked this movie, it had a bigger budget, but I don't think it had a bigger heart.8/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie",
    "reviewBody": "(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)",

    "reviewTitle": "Raison d'etre...just want to watch the world burn.",
    "reviewBody": "Heath Ledger's edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his costume is the right colours, but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like he's been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars, smudged & cracked white wash, blacken sharks eyes of death, capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks and tongue snakes, his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. As fans, we wait to finally hear the Joker's maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of choice (not the lint or veg peeler) is the knife, for both it's ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for The Batman, Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into the minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a world without rules, where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the transformation of Gotham's White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent.The eerie background \"music\" is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through Gotham's cityscapes as a harbinger of the Joker's evil to come.In all fairness Ledger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burton's 80's film delivered a comic book to screen, thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave that's stamped with Jack's vintage trademark. Ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that won't let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that Ledger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers, namely Hopkins/Lecter, Spacey/Doe.This is a tour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype (rare thing) and even raises the bar (even rarer). So kudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember, the next time you're playing a card game your hand may come up with the Joker's signature calling card. RIP HL.",

    "reviewTitle": "Excellent Sequel to Batman Begins",
    "reviewBody": "One thing's for sure: comic book based movies are here to stay. Once before they were B-movie, red headed stepchildren with very miniscule budgets and low grade actors, now these films regularly attract A-list talent both in front and behind the camera. The latest in this summer comic book slate is THE DARK KNIGHT, the sequel to the well received and awesomely successful Batman reboot BATMAN BEGINS and continues right where it left off.Where the first movie dealt with the origins of how and why Batman came to be, this sequel now moves onto a larger canvas: the storyline now revolves around the consequences of Batman's appearance in a city gripped by crime and hopelessness. With the demise of former mob boss Carmine Falcone's power in Gotham City, the various crime syndicates are now leaderless and trying to reconsolidate as Batman (Christian Bale) AKA billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne continues his relentless assault to restore order. In the first film director Chris Nolan portrayed Gotham as a sort of cross between the slums of Hong Kong and Chicago of the Al Capone era with lots of rain and gloom, now Gotham is depicted as being very similar to New York, with many massive high rises and somewhat sunnier skies, it seems Gotham is literally coming back to life.But even with new fearless district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart in his best role to date), it seems the city is just a few steps ahead of the rising tide of criminality that is beginning to strike back against its newfound heroes and it manifests itself into a new and powerful adversary called the Joker (Heath Ledger in his final film role). I have always found that the main differences between the main comic book makers Marvel and DC is in the portrayal of their heroes- whereas Marvel superheroes tend to be average guys and gals who are thrust with superpowers and lots of responsibility, DC superheroes tend to be iconic representations of the human condition: Superman is a depiction of the ideals and greatness of mankind while Batman represents vigilantism and revenge. As the plot of the movie unfolds, the forces of law and order, represented by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman once again reprises his role and it has been expanded considerably) and Harvey Dent, battle it out on the streets of Gotham city against the forces of criminality with mob bosses Eric Roberts and Michael Jai White (yes, the SPAWN guy is here too) allied with chaos and anarchy which is represented by the Joker with Batman the vigilante smack dab in the middle of it all. Despite Batman being on the side of order, his very methods create a copycat gang of vigilantes who style themselves after him which puts the city even closer to the brink. As all the swirling plot lines culminate into one big showdown, Batman must make his choices carefully as every action he takes creates unintended and sometimes tragic consequences.The last great movie I saw since last year was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN but I can say that THE DARK KNIGHT finally gives me a satisfaction that I had been missing for over a year now. The acting is superb with many old faces returning- Morgan Freeman is homely as Lucius Fox while Oldman has a larger role and consequently gets to shine even further. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes is an infinitely better actress than her predecessor (though I thought Katie Holmes looked sexier even though she had zero talent) but her role is somewhat subdued and we never got more into her character. Christian Bale is adequate for the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne though he doesn't seem to put in anything new to the character (I still think Micheal Keaton was the best movie Batman). The big question is obviously on Heath Ledger and he delivers a deliciously wicked and sadistic Joker- very similar to Jack Nicholson's take on the character and that's a compliment; my only peeve is that he wasn't given a permanent smile like the previous Jokers in the movie and comic book- slightly different take but still very, very entertaining and fits in well with Nolan's more realistic version of the venerable Bat franchise. It is sad that Ledger will never be able to reprise his role and his makeup seems so similar to that of the equally late Brandon Lee in THE CROW that the parallels are eerie. Unlike the past incarnations of the movie and cartoon Jokers, Ledgers performance has transformed the Joker from a villain with a smile on his face into anarchy incarnate- he is no longer just a bad guy but a force of nature. The big surprise here is Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent- he steals every scene he is in and watching his fall from grace is like seeing that of an epic Shakespearean tragedy.Terrific action sequences and nail biting suspense adds to an epic sequel: 8 out of 10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Even darker than Batman Begins, though the Joker didn't die.",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan's approach for Batman again worked. Judging by my observation in a Bangkok cinema on July 17, it will drain at least 150,000,000 both in US and worldwide. This is one of the main movies, if not THE main movie, of the year. But it's not your typical commercial comic hero for many reasons.1, Back in 2005, Batman begins was criticized to be too dark, as a Batman movie. If you still give points to those comments, you will definitely find the Dark Knight even darker, maybe as twice dark as Begins. In the movie, there are virtually no sex, no explicit gore and even no swearing. But there are two main traditional villains, both twisted and horrifying as much as any A-Class horror movie villain. There are main characters died in most miserable circumstances, which made the audiences depressed. There is also a darker conclusion for Batman's fate, and none of the above was presented in a moderate way. 2, Come along the dark messages, is our dear Joker. We know the Joker didn't die; Heath Ledger died instead. There is still a rumor around saying that, it's the Joker, who dragged Ledger into a world of madness and didn't release him from the character, killed Ledger. The rumor can't be justified, but the Joker does jump out of the screen. He threatens everyone on and off the screen in a unusual manner, giving you a chill which makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a Disney joker. This is a very daring performance indeed, but dangerous, for the parents may find their children approve the Joker for his logic and his value which work better in the \"real world\". It seems this Batman movie doesn't belong to Batman, but to the Joker, who essentially pushed the whole story forward and destroyed more than just human lives, but also their beliefs in Batman. 3, Batman doesn't own this movie. He is merely a narrator, a firefighter who desperately saves human lives from evil, while witnessing tragedies happening around. Once he want to be proactive, he drags himself into more trouble. Consequently, friends have gone one by another.If we see any development on Batman's character, that should be his loneliness.So, audiences may find Dark Knight a bit more difficult to swallow than Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Hellboy 2 and Hancock. Among all the blockbusters so far, it assumes more thinking and higher IQ from the audiences... Honestly speaking, I can't recommend this to everyone, especially NOT to children.I will recommend it to those who: 1, require a smart script and intelligent quotes. 2, willing to see creative action sequences and less CGIs. 3, not allergic to extreme violence and anarchism. 4, accept the realistic(sometimes pessimistic) messages from a superhero movie. 5, at least 20 years old.Feel free to listen to some lighthearted musics after you see Dark Knight, if you need something to get rid of the mood.9/10 Almost excellent.",

    "reviewTitle": "Believe the hype",
    "reviewBody": "Before we begin, I'd like to reveal something about myself. I am not a fan of Batman. That is not to say I dislike Batman, but I have never been especially driven to seek out adventures and merchandise pertaining to Gotham's favourite costumed watchdog. Prior to seeing Knight, the only two Batman movies I have seen in full are Batman and Robin and Batman Begins. I'm not about to pass harsh judgment on either - I admit B&R was quite amusing in a rather unintentional way and that Batman Begins was a well-crafted film (but I do not consider it to be a masterpiece in any way). At the very least, it set the bar high for its successor, and rather high up at that.I know there's a thread floating around here with the first five minutes of Knight in it. I never looked at it here, seeing it for the first time on an IMAX screen. This opening scene alone - which follows a bank robbery, and that is all I shall say about it - gives a very good indication of just how highly Knight sets its own bar. It burns its way into your head and lets you know that the next two-and-a-half hours are going to be quite a step up from what you were probably expecting.Plot-wise, you should have a fairly good idea what's going on. There's Batman and there's the Joker and there's the usual kind of plot complications that dog the \"superhero sequel\", namely the whole act of strongly humanising the hero (just like all the other \"2\" movies). I'm not about to deride Knight for its few clichéd plot devices - show me a blockbuster sequel without them. It's what the plot gets surrounded with that will truly impress you.First off, the acting. A serious sequel demands very strong character development. Seeing as a lot of you are hardened moviegoers, you no doubt already know that. Of course, Knight sticks to this \"rule\". But how it does is impressive. The cast is impressive. Aside from strong returns from Caine, Oldman and Freeman, you have the introduction of a handful of new characters that will stick around in viewers' memories longer than, say, the Scarecrow.Obviously, the first thing to come to mind is the Joker. Naturally I was wary of all the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's oh-so-epic final role. Could it really be as good as everybody was saying? The answer is a loud and hearty YES. Ledger is quite simply a showstopper. He steals more scenes than the Joker steals loot. His presence is simply commanding. Right from one of the earliest scenes (which I won't spoil with anything other than the phrase \"magic trick\") he takes hold and doesn't let go. Whether this talk of an Oscar is far-fetched or not, I can honestly see a nomination happening. I kept thinking to myself, \"This is Ledger?\" And when an actor is capable of doing that, well that is a good actor indeed. Now I can see how much of a tragedy his death truly is.The other character of note is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent (best known to fans for becoming Two-Face). Granted, Eckhart does not do as much show-stealing as Ledger, but his performance is carefully played and very convincing as he goes through a number of stages, from smooth and trusty to thinly veiled psychopathy. When his transformation into Two-Face is revealed, it is one hell of a shock (and a damned good effects job).Ironically, for a movie titled The Dark Knight, it seems like Christian Bale as the eponymous character is overshadowed by the aforementioned examples. Granted, this is because Bale is quite simply not a showboating kind of actor (at least in my experience), and that makes a fine contrast to the Joker's wild streak. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal doesn't really make that much of a better Rachel than Katie Holmes did, but it's a forgivable flaw in an otherwise brilliant spot of casting.Of course, being a summer blockbuster (or winter, as the case may be), it just wouldn't be a superhero movie without a hefty helping of action sequences. The action is par for the course - there's chases, fights, even a couple of handfuls of suspenseful \"beat-the-clock\" moments. There are a handful of moments which induce laughs or a collective \"Whoa\" from the audience (namely, the Batpod). The inclusion of the Joker and his penchant for playing tricks make for some truly interesting setpieces, especially the \"social experiment\" he pulls near the climax.Then we get to the ending. While it's not a cliffhanger, it really does end on a rather ambiguous note (kind of like The Road Warrior did) which sort of leaves it open for a third film, but at the same time doesn't, if that makes any sense. It could've been handled better, I suppose, but it's all about leaving them wanting more and the ending - which shows that things are only going to get much worse for Batman - certainly illustrates that.The Dark Knight really did manage to pull off a miracle. It lived up to all of its hype (both pre- and post-Ledger's demise) and it indicates that not all blockbusters are going to pot. The only problem I can see this creating is that if there is a third instalment in this new trilogy (which, in all probability, there will be) it probably will not manage to top this one. This will be a one-of-a-kind, and who knows, maybe in 30 years' time when people are talking about which sequels were better than the original, the first movie to pop up will be The Dark Knight.",

    "reviewTitle": "Mediocre summer popcorn movie with warped morals",
    "reviewBody": "In reality, I give this film a score of \"4 out of 10\", but the one-star rating you see above is intended to balance out the obvious shill vote (marketing hype, \"astroturf\", 10/10 votes and comments by paid-for marketing weenies posing as real, unbiased people).At the time of this writing, the film has a 9.7-out-of-10 rating which it clearly does not in any sense deserve. It merits half that rating.I saw \"Batman\" last night. 2.5 hours meant that one gets one's money's worth, but heck... it's not half as good as advertisers and IMDb.com would have us believe. The plot line drags, the characters are shallow, the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped.The \"dark knight\" is more like a dim bulb.It's hard to believe in Heath Ledger as the Joker. He's just too broad in the face, one-dimensional in this role, and weighed down by poor writing. His makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film, but there were obvious touch-ups and clean-ups that reminded the audience \"this is make-believe.\" His garb was supposed to be purple-on-green, but was so dark as to look like a black suit. His actions were so reckless that we, as an audience, were constantly reminded that \"this ain't even close to reality. Even a toddler wouldn't believe that this scheme would leave The Joker alive and thriving.\"Worse, we're given zero back-story to help us believe that The Joker's feelings and craziness are based on something. In fact, the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that The Joker has no past, no legitimate reason for his hatred and aggression, and is simply not understandable. To that, I say \"Go back to scriptwriting school, and take a few psychology classes while you're there. A character isn't menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving the emotions.\"Worse, Christian Bale as Batman. Christian Bale, though good at dieting and working out, has all the humanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood. Without a sound track, sure, he'd do well as a male model. As a actor, though, he's just taking up space on the screen. Worse, his lisping (with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen his voice) make him unbelievable as Batman and as perfectionist billionaire.Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave an unemotive performance. Worse, he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects of acting. This is NOT the caliber of performance that he delivered for \"Leon\" (\"The Professional\") and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\". This was an obvious potboiler, walk-on-and-take-the-money performance.Likewise for all the other performers except hyperactive Heath Ledger and a small one-dimensional part played by the wife of one character. I felt no emotion from any of the other actors and actresses, despite the big ups and downs in the plot line. Dammit, if your daddy dies or you quit your lifelong job, y'oughta look a little broken up!With two exceptions, the special effects did nothing for me: 1) I felt a bit of adrenalin when Batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his shoulder into the street. 2) Harvey Two-face's mask was well done: that gets a thumbs up, though I wouldn't want kids seeing it or they'll have nightmares.A few scenes just left me scratching my head, saying \"that would never happen; that's beyond stupid, even for a cartoon movie.\" When Batman glides down from one building on his wings, darn it, the wings should look full of air like a parachute, not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction!Even the love interest was a bit bland. They found a frumpy, not-too-pretty woman to play Batman's love-of-his-life, and apparently asked her to play her role as though nothing-- romance, impending death, and explosions-- matters. I've seen people react more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a Starbucks! >:oThe morality is twisted. From a comic book, one should expect flat, one-dimensional thinking. From Frank Miller, the talented artist but stupid Ayn Rand follower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based, one should expect wildly offensive \"morality\" that would make even an idiot say \"wtf, man, rethink this!\" The plot and characters will inevitably be compared to America's McCarthyist-style \"war on terrorism\", and that just sickens me, because I see the film try to justify a patronizing, lying, violent attitude from government and a billionaire.Everywhere in the film, actors are saying \"This is wrong-headed, illegal, untruthful, patronizing to the citizenry, and an abuse of power... but we're in a dark, scary time so it's OK for now.\" Art imitates life, eh! I felt deeply ill.So far this summer, Hancock is the only superhero movie I'd endorse, and that would only get a weak thumbs-up. It's at least funny, and does not try to paint a comic-book morality as \"heroic\".So what SHOULD you see as an action/popcorn movie this summer? I'm wondering if the \"Voyage to the Center of the Earth\" film or the new Mummy film, both starring Brendan Frasier, will be a bit better... or at least have a few funny lines. The trailers, though, hint that they'll be campy and unbelievable.",

    "reviewTitle": "The night is Darkest before the Dawn...",
    "reviewBody": "Is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than I was? Maybe but most probably not. I've been looking forward to another Batman movie since the credits rolled on \"Batman Begins\" back in 2005. Batman is a movie that needs no synopsis, even for non-fans. But in case you are totally clueless, all you need to know is that Batman is a guy that dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in Gotham city. The Dark Knight continues where Batman Begins left off. Christian Bale reprises his role as Barman from the last movie, and this time he has two new villains: The Joker, played by Heath Ledger and Two-Face/Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. This is no doubt the most hyped movie of the year, especially with Heath's sudden death, and I must tell you it was up to the hype, or very very close to it. There's a buzz for an Oscar campaign for Heath and I'll tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an Oscar, or at least a nomination. If Warner Brothers didn't tell us Heath was playing The Joker, I swear not many people would have guessed it was him. I know I wouldn't have. So is this a good movie or just a good-Joker-used-to-promote-an-average movie? Good question. But an even better question is did you watch Batman Begins? Did you enjoy it? If you watch this movie, you'll never want to watch Batman Begins again because The Dark Knight will make it look like the worst movie you've ever seen. I promise you. Everyone is talking about The Joker, but Harvey Dent/Two face is equally as good. His make- up, as Two Face will blow you away, and his acting is nothing less than amazing. Everyone else reprised their role from the last movie; all except Katie Holmes which if you ask me is a good move because I felt she didn't really belong in the first one. She is replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal, which I love. Director Christopher Nolan is a genius (Yes I know all the directors I reviewed are geniuses). He not only made an awesome superhero movie, but an awesome crime/detective movie. His brother Jonathan Nolan worked on the script, and since I saw Memento which the two worked on, I know that these two were born to work together. So is there anything bad about this movie? As another critic rightly put it, \"This movie was too long, but I'm only saying this so it seems like I'm doing my job...\" That being said, I don't think the length of this movie is a problem at all. I mean, The Godfather ran for almost three hours, I don't hear anyone complaining. Moreover, in most long movies, you'll see a scene or two that can be cut to shorten it, The Dark Knight had none. It was pure two and a half hours of awesomeness! The closing speech of the movie ended with Commissioner Gordon saying \"... he's the Dark Knight\". Then there was a black screen. It was at that time that I noticed tears rolling down my cheeks because of how lucky I feel to be alive to witness this cinematic masterpiece. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the first movie I've given 5 out of 5 stars!",

    "reviewTitle": "\"Batman Has No Limits\"",
    "reviewBody": "(Warning! Lots of Spoilers! Only read if you've seen the film!)Batman has leaped straight out of the comic book pages and into the real world. To compare \"The Dark Knight\" to say the \"Spider-Man\" franchise for example, is almost a joke. The reboot \"Batman Begins\" established Batman in the real world, and now the sequel takes that an entire step forward. \"The Dark Knight\" is more than just a great comic book movie, its a masterpiece.It's been a little over a day since I've seen \"The Dark Knight\". It really lingers in the mind after a while, even if you're not a big fan of Batman you will be of this future classic crime drama. As I've pondered over the film more and more, I've come to understand it's many complexities.Since the first film, the mob is getting more and more desperate to launder their cash. Why? Because Batman has been cleaning up the streets and cops and lawyers can no longer be bought. The Joker is employed by the mob to take down the Batman and bring corruption back to Gotham. Until Batman turns himself in, The Joker will continue to kill people. Is Batman a hero? Or just a vigilante looking for self righteousness?While re watching \"The Prestige\" the other day, knowing the twist ending, it was beautiful to see how well crafted it was. How much little things that may seem like padding are actually hints that apply to the symbolism of the entire film. The same goes for \"The Dark Knight\". Not only is it a good picture that stays true to the characters and stories of Batman, like \"Batman Begins\" did, but its really an artful film. Thats a lot to say for a movie based off of a comic book.As the credits started to roll I wondered what the plot twist was. I thought to myself \"There must not be one in this film\", little did I know how subtle it was. Upon further pondering I figured it out. Bale replies to Caine in one scene \"Batman has no limits\". That statement is both true and false. The Joker tempts Batman to \"break his one rule\".Another part of the film that has deep meaning is The Joker. We know from the film that The Joker was somehow abused in the past. So he has lost all faith in people. There is evil in everyone. Two sides one \"coin\". The Joker strives to create dramatic examples. By corrupting Batman, their White Knight, and themselves. \"When it comes down to it, every man for himself, every person is evil\" is his basic logic. The Joker acknowledges that he is morally wrong, but wants to prove it to Batman and everyone else in Gotham that they are not much different from himself (Thats a little Killing Joke for you).The films puts you into a an exciting roller coaster, and a rather abrupt, yet beautiful ending that will leave you stunned. The story is intelligent and action-packed, it is wonderfully well acted to create great characters, and it really speaks to you.Batman breaks the law for justice, the city who he protects hates him, and yet he still fights injustice for the right reasons. To keep an eight year old's parents from dying. He will only stop when the evil that created Batman is gone. Thats what a hero is. A+",

    "reviewBody": "Just got home from watching the Dark Knight and wow, and i mean wow. The acting was great, the plot, the build up, the climax and everything was excellent and it has surely surpassed its hype! Christian Bale delivered another strong performance as the Batman and his Bruce Wayne character is even stronger now than the first film. Aaron Eckheart did also a very good Harvey Dent/Two Face; and by the way, the effects for the disfigured face of Two Face is awesome (looks like the one in the long halloween). And hell, Heath Ledger even surpassed Jack Nicholson's Joker.And at the end of the day, after all that happened, Batman didn't get what he wanted, Harvey Dent surely didn't get what he deserved and Gotham City as a whole surely lost. It was actually only the Joker who won. It would have been better if they showed one after credits shot of the Joker laughing his ass off inside Arkham Asylum; but that would be wishful thinking.:)",

    "reviewTitle": "\"Best Comic Book Based Movie Ever\"",
    "reviewBody": "The most anticipated movie of the year finally hits screens this Friday, both in 2-D and IMAX formats. Christian Bale returns as the mysterious and ultra rich Bruce Wayne/Batman. Violence has plagued the streets in Gotham City (which looks a lot like Chicago) and Batman teams up with Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to weed out the crime, in which a new villain arrives, played by the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, unleashing unspeakable horror and crime to the citizens of Gotham City. It becomes the Joker's mission to beat Batman at his own game, therefore making his revenge very personal as he playfully quips, \"Criminals used to believe in things like honor, respect. What doesn't kill you makes you stranger\". I'm totally recommending The Dark Knight to be seen on the biggest screen possible, perhaps at an IMAX screen nearest you. Watching Christopher Nolan's near masterpiece gave me a whole new level of movie-going experience and this fascinating director has definitely set the bar even higher for comic book based movies, which he had already done with his earlier film, Batman Begins. This is the first Hollywood film that used IMAX digital cameras that was partially shot in this new and improved format. I certainly experienced vertigo in certain scenes as the camera hovered above city skyscrapers such as the ones that took place in Hong Kong as Batman stood still on the corner of a building looking down. The Dark Knight delivers in all areas. But let me for a talk for a second about the action scenes. They are definitely incredible! The death-defying stunt work looks pretty authentic and any computer generated imagery was covert and difficult to pin-point. Take for example as Batman's heavy armored vehicle loses all power and it reactivates itself into some sort of over-sized motorcycle; Batman races at breakneck speeds through tunnels and buildings then in and around a 18' wheeler, flipping it violently upside down with Bat-wires. An incredible feat that only last seconds but one where I had to catch my breath. Much has been talked about Ledger's eerie portrayal of the Joker. Ledger loses himself in this role like Marlon Brando did in The Godfather and Anthony Hopkins does in The Silence of the Lambs. It's sorrowfully chilling and definitely that good. He'll for sure be nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar as should the film for Best Picture. At over 2 1/2 hours long, this is definitely one of the longest comic book based movies, but Nolan and his editor, Lee Smith, move things along just fine. There is some fine music by two maestros, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, both Academy Award winners; they don't inundate us with heavy piercing sound through the actions scene but instead let those scenes entertain us for themselves. The cinematography and set designs are dark and moody but appropriate for this type of film. With it's technical accomplishments, very fine performances (including Morgan Freeman as technical wizard Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as butler Alfred Pennyworth) most especially by Ledger, The Dark Knight is not only one of the best films of the year (which also works splendidly as a crime thriller) but will go down in history as the best comic book based movie ever.",

    "reviewBody": "There has been much hype about The Dark Knight, sometimes too much hype can actually be deflated when the presentation doesn't surpass let alone meet the expectations of the hoop- la. David Goyer & Christopher Nolan have chemistry. Begins is a foundation and Knight is their masterpiece. When you have been a big fan of Bob Kane's - Leonardo Di Vinci influence of a superhero for as long as I have expectations can be deflated easily. The Dark Knight delivers more than was the hype has been. Chris & David realize they were able to bypass unsurmountable corporate loopholes to deliver a more intelligent character adaptation of film. Less candy and actually respect the intelligence of the audience and the power they have with imagination. The Dark Knight is heavy in development that pays off with what they don't tell you - They juggle the (spoiler ahead) notion that lets get the audience to have a taste of the Joker in the same manner as how Batman deals with him - no history, no understanding, just utter chaos and moral-less havoc. - Bloody brilliant performance by all actors, not just heath but I would nominate Gary for his amazing ability to embody Commissioner Gordan. The irony of the cast you would discount Bale because his role is hidden behind the mask - but his talents and dedication to the craft has elevated Bruce/Batman to a level where the audience can't think of a better actor to play the lead role.The Dark Knight has given the audience a reason to come to the theaters - not merely to be entertained but to be enlightened by such masterful attention to detail, hard work and a movie that weighs heavy because it doesn't second guess the audience - I was in awe of its spectacle and was left speechless after the preview - I am actually afraid to see it again on IMAX and be weighted down with emotions on how poetic this film is and will be for generations..be prepared for film noir - brilliance. Kudos David and Chris.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight - Exceeds Every Expectation",
    "reviewBody": "For all the hype which surrounded and preceded it, the almost three-hour-long film surely delivered. It was comparable to a never ending roller-coaster ride of various emotions and of crafty mindgames. To say that it was unnecessarily long would be true, but I don't think anyone in the cinema really cared  because every single scene, every little second was essential, entertaining and breathtaking. It was the complete experience which just couldn't be dissected into random facets.The cinematography and the music were very effective. The dark grays which pretty much bordered most of the scenes, the clever editing and the suspenseful pace molded it to become one heck of a great movie.The story was surprisingly complex and intelligent, which is not very common in superhero movies. Distinctive philosophies and opposing personalities came into play in a war of extremes.The character development was very comprehensive and the cast was excellent. Christian Bale was effortlessly Batman and Bruce Wayne once again, silent, dashing, troubled and cunning. (I still hate Batman's scary raspy robotic voice though.) He was indeed the flawed hero. Much has been said about Heath Ledger's performance as the psychotic and merciless Joker, and you especially ought to see it for yourselves. He was funny, creepy, alarming, perplexing and everything else in between. He was subtle and he was overpowering... He totally owned it down to the random flicks of his tongue.Maggie Gyllenhaal was initially a turn off as I felt as if the role of Rachel Dawes didn't suit her for some reason, but she grew on me. It was funny though how it seemed as if she was acting as \"Katie Holmes\" and not as \"Rachel Dawes\". Aaron Eckhart was excellent as District Attorney Harvey Dent but was somewhat a disappointment as Two-Face. I'm not sure if Heath Ledger merely upstaged him as a villain, but something was certainly lacking in Two-Face. Perhaps more personality, more polarity  he was Two-Face after all. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were also notable in their subdued minor roles.I was never a comic book fan, but if there ever was a movie that in all honesty made me want to be one  it would have to be The Dark Knight. (Though some say it was quite different from the comic.) With its complexity, its gritty action, its genuine characters, its resolute intelligence and its incredible tragedy, it was something that leaves one breathless. Exhausted even.Sure, the movie had it flaws  but seriously, I don't think anyone would even dare to nitpick.It was intimate and yet epic, it was exhilarating and yet heartbreaking. I would absolutely watch it again.",

    "reviewTitle": "So awesome, they're going to need to come up with a new adjective to describe it",
    "reviewBody": "I don't usually write reviews like this. In fact, I generally only do it if a film is either abysmal or mind-numbingly good. The Dark Knight is one of the latter.There's only one man and one film I can relate this one two, and ironically enough, it's Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin, a film which is despised by anyone with half a brain. It may seem a little odd for me to be making the comparison, but please, hear me out: the reason I'm likening Nolan to Schumacher when they're so far apart in terms of the quality of films they produced that they shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence together is because they both has an astronomical effect on the franchise. Sure, Schumacher's was for all the wrong reasons, but Nolan also takes Batman in directions we never thought possible.The Dark Knight is the superhero film we've been waiting for since Superman II. In some respects, it's been almost thirty years in the making. One of my favourite writers of all time - Joss Whedon - once related how he saw the trailer to Batman Returns and was disappointed in it because the plot involved the bad guys attempting to frame Batman. If you're the villain, you don't frame your hero, Whedon says. You corrupt him. You take away everything he loves, destroy everything he stands for and drag him down to your level so that even if he wins, you don't lose because he'll be no better than you. And The Dark Knight does just that.Performance-wise, the first mention has to go to Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, because it's very easy to add him as an afterthought to Heath Ledger's Joker. Like the marketing material says, you surely do BELIEVE in Harvey Dent. He's armed with more charisma than one man should legally be allowed to carry around, a kind of magnetism that comes from a natural leader. Sure, he can seem naive to the point of cheesiness, but it really does work. More, Eckhart pulls it off with a kind of laziness that makes it look easy.As for the Joker ... well, I think it's safe to say Heath Ledger is going to be the new standard by which film villains are going to be judged. You wouldn't know it was Ledger in the role if you hadn't been told beforehand; I've seen actors immerse themselves in roles - Nathan Fillion in Firefly and Serenity springs to mind - but until I saw The Dark Knight, I had never see an actor sink themselves into a character as far as Ledger did, and it's deeply unfair to see him get all the best lines and most of the best moments.And of course, Chrstian Bale is far more subtle in his approach. While I would have liked to see a few more scenes with him as Bruce Wayne, I still liked him. And ye, he's better than Michael Keaton. Not in the same way that Heath Ledger is better than Jack Nicholson - there, I said it - but in his own way, adding as much depth to Wayne as to Batman. Meanwhile, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are their usual selves, which is a drawcard in their favour as this film certainly needed stability in the form of those characters. It's good to see Gary Oldman as James Gordon getting something to do and being able to do them himself - something I felt previous incarnations of the character never got to do - and Maggie Gyllenhaal more than makes up for Katie Holmes' performance in Batman Begins (to the point where you have to wonder what both the films would have been like if one of the two stayed for both films).The Dark Knight isn't a perfect film, but then show me one that is. There's a few minor issues here and there; one sequence that sticks out in my mind is late in the film where we see the film in a kind of super-sonar view, with the end result being that it's jarring, a little confusing and the images and sounds push it to the extent of sensory overload (but it was nearly 2am when I saw it ...). Comparisons to Heat and The Godfather Part II are wholly deserved: The Dark Knight isn't just a superhero film, it's something more by a whole order of magnitude.",

    "reviewBody": "I had the luxury of seeing Dark Knight when it first hit theaters this week and let me tell you, I was quite disappointed.I do not understand what the rave reviews are about but I found the plot line very complicated and confusing most times. Jumping from here to there, pushing far too much for a nearly 3 hour movie. Heath Ledger is an excellent actor of course but I found Nolan's version of Joker very demented and nothing like the comic book Joker or cartoons. He seemed like a mental patient then the Joker I grew up reading. Where were the jokes and the twisted sense of humor? The only thing they left was the menacing laugh which Ledger did fantastically.While I love watching Superheros, there just wasn't enough Batman. The whole movie focused a lot on the Harvey Dent character, who in my opinion should have been left for the third installment. It was already enough to have Joker as the villain, but Two-Face too? The development of Two-Face was quick as it ended. And his agenda was too poor to be believable as to why he was the classic Two-Face Batman fans know of.Batman himself was ho-hum. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but as batman? No. That voice he puts on which supposedly was to be menacing came up more constipated and very forced. You could barely hear his dialog along with his spit fly out of his mouth occasionally. However, I did enjoy his fighting, which was downright how I see Batman fight the big baddies. But the main thing that bothered me most on whole that was missing was the Batmobile. I have no idea what Nolan was thinking to not include it in the movie. It was the main reasons I wanted to see it in the first place. Not to mention his classic domain, the Batcave, which was replaced with an underground high-tech warehouse. Not impressive.Overall, the movie was just too long, too complicated and forgettable. I favor Tim Burton's Batman over Nolan's version by a long shot. But then, everyone has their own opinion.4/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Why so serious, right?",
    "reviewBody": "\"The Dark Knight\" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor \"Batman Begins\". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline. It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: \"You complete me\". That phrase reminded me of the great movie \"Unbreakable\" is. But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design. \"It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you\", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in \"Batman Begins\". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart). Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of \"The Dark Knight's\" treats to the viewer. Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town \"deserves a better kind of criminal\"-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose. Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in \"Batman Begins\". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.The rest of the ensemble, as in \"Batman Begins\", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but \"The Dark Knight\" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?",

You really have to give credit to the man; he did came a long way from A Knight's Tale and 10 Things. His Joker was discomfiting, psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns! With his passing, it up the spooky scale a few notches. He held his own against the big wigs - well, I think he even surpassed a few of them. He has the best one-liners too! His lines spoke of chaos, death or the lack thereof. Art imitating life or vice versa. One wonders if he took his character a tad too far.To sum it all up, The Dark Knight has twists at every turn, exciting batmobile chases, cool new gadgets (and suit!), stellar performances, tight plots and witty script. This made for a very good summer movie.Go watch it or you'll be the last not to. And parting in the Joker's (now famous) line - \"Why so serious?\"",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is a brilliant film. Everything was done right, stemming from a totally rich and in depth story that never failed to deliver its punches where it mattered, and frankly speaking, caught me off guard a number of times with its superb sleight of hand technique. Every one of the A-list cast lived up to their potential, and evergreens from the previous movie like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, have a lot more to do this time round.This is hands down THE movie of the year for me to date, and it'll really take a lot to knock it off its perch. I suggest you rush out of the door right now, get yourself tickets and watch it. I'm going to do so again. I believe in Christopher Nolan, and Bat-fans around the world would have followed suit too.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Superhero Movie Ever",
    "reviewBody": "Most superhero movies are made to give you a feeling of escapism. THat webbing through rooftops or having claws for hands would be great and wishing that you yourself had that power. Not this one. The Dark Knight begins where the last one left off, with the theme of escalation.Batman ( Christian Bale ) and Liutenant Gordon( Gary Oldman ) with the help of the new District Attorney Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) have smashed crime to the point where they are beginning to run scared. Batman himself is beginning to think that soon he may be able to hang up the cape and the cowl for good and reunite with Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ).However, the mob has one last resort up it's sleeve, and it's a proposal by a rising criminal known only to the citizens of Gotham as the Joker ( Heath Ledger ). The Joker, however, has an agenda entirely of his own and soon begins to cause terror on a massed scale which has even Batman lost for ideas. The Dark Knight is a really amazing film, which utillises real live stunts to great effect, making seem so much more gritty and dark than it's neon-lit competitors. Be warned that it is not a film for kids, as the violence, in particular perpetrated by the Joker is confronting and at times very twisted. Christian Bale, while still not quite of the level of Michael Keaton's Batman, still does a very good job while Michael Caine is once again great as his stoic butler. Morgan Freeman is good and Aaron Eckhart brings a great element of tragedy to the role of Harvey Dent. But it is Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger who truly excel. Oldman's Gordon is a conflicted character who is put through the wringer throughout the movie by both his allies and his enemies while being nothing more than an honest cop- one of the last ones. But everyone here is playing second fiddle to the Joker. Heath Ledger brings him a menace and an edge which is so tangible that at times it is truly terrifying. His laugh is bone-chilling and his sense of humour is both funny and incredibly twisted as his 'philosophy'. He deserves every amount of praise, as it is a truly awful foe for Batman to face. The Dark KNight is a superhero film full of twists and turns that never lets up. Instead it graps you by your lapels and drags you into its dark majestic splendour.",

    "reviewTitle": "Little to do with Ledger . . .",
    "reviewBody": "\"Evil is the nature of mankind.\" Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\" I have a strong urge to downgrade Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight to a B for BEING too long, for BEARING too many anti-climaxes, BUT it also happens to BE the best super-hero movie of the summer and one of the BEST comic book adaptations ever. This praise has little to do with Heath Ledger's memorable turn as The Joker, so good it will instantaneously make you forget Jack Nicholson's famous rendition.What really qualifies Dark Knight is the titular fulfillment: Not only does Christian Bale's Batman become dark, almost every major character goes through a dark night of the soul, except the ruleless Joker, for whom evil is a playful way of living out his days. The characters are challenged by the evil and goodness of humanity and of themselves. Like many of us, being good for these characters ironically involves personal vanity and a vulnerability to love.So ingenious is the script that at any one point, multiple good guys could be bad with the flip of a coin. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a case in point: He becomes the new Gotham hero by rounding up the usual mob suspects; he becomes a problematic warrior in the real struggle of the soul, whereby he must reconcile his inherently virtuous soul with the requisite means of fighting evil, a moral trap the Joker plays well.Dark Knight easily buddies up with Iron Man's ambiguity this summer as it pokes the audience with quandaries about the endless and tiring clash with evil (read 9/11 and the Iraq War) and the means to revenge or end the mayhem (read Neocon strategies). However if you don't wish to indulge these allegorical fancies, just enjoy cinematographer Wally Pfister's transformation of Chicago into a fantasy land almost better than a comic book's art.But the film doesn't leave the people of Gotham and presumably the audience out of the mix either, for they all must make choices from as banal as blowing up a boat to as profound as tracking down their saviors, The agent of evil, the Joker, makes believable the racking decisions he maneuvers for private citizens and public officials. In the end, they are in control of their moral choicesthe joke's on them.As Joker says, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stranger.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "I love Christopher Nolan....",
    "reviewBody": "Dear God I love Christopher Nolan. In his five film career, beginning with \"Memento\" he has not put a foot wrong, building a body of work which supports the assertion that he is the most talented director of his generation. With The Dark Knight he has created the best comic book film ever. Period.Dark Knight is the most perfect blend of style and substance, action and drama that I've ever seen. It's technically brilliant, with awe inspiring action sequences that must be seen to be believed. The action however, is not superfluous but feeds off the dramatic subtext of the script. Nolan explores what it is to be a hero, and the pitfalls of protecting a city that seems to be suffering because of the very existence of that so called hero. Each actor slips perfectly into their role, with honourable mention going to Aaron Eckhart who did far better than I expected as Harvey Dent. Towering above them all however is Heath Ledger. Almost 20 years ago Jack Nicholson portrayed a Joker that many felt could never be topped or re-attempted. Whilst it is unfair to compare the two, one certainty is that it will be at least that long again before any other actor can don the maniacal grin once more. True, the Joker by his very nature is bound to steal the show.....true, the Nolan brothers have scripted the Joker in a unique way, filled with memorable dialogue. Nothing however, can take away from Ledger, who's every movement, every word, every physical nuance is part of a meticulously crafted madman. This Joker ranks among the greatest of villains as he seemingly needs no motivation for his actions other than the constant thirst for chaos. The Joker is all animalistic instinct and in Batman the Joker has found a nemesis whom he enjoys being pitted against. For the Joker it is not the outcome that is important but the fight itself. His lack of fear or reverence to anything is truly terrifying. Ledger's final completed performance is perhaps the mot bittersweet piece of acting to watch as it now serves as a swansong, rather than heralding the arrival of a monumentally talented superstar. There is nothing I can say about Ledger, or the film that hasn't already been said but in there lies the film's true brilliance......I feel the need to rave about it anyway.",

    "reviewBody": "When the first Batman movie came out more tan a decade ago, I thought it was as expected. And the sequels actually got worse with each installment.Batman Begins gave me a breath of \"fresh\" air as it went back to the roots and produce a darker and meaner Batman, one where Bob Kane would have been very proud of.I thought a sequel might be equal to or less than Batman Begins... Boy! Am I ever more wrong....This movie keeps its pace, not too fast, not too slow but everything keeps piling up, breaking down and piles higher again. Wow!!! All of Marvel's recent movies cannot even dream of matching half the success of this one. My goodness! I have seen a true translation of the Dark Knight.Enough of an old fan boy's ramblings.First, the plots and story. Like I have mentioned the plot keeps adding up even when you thought it was being broken down. However, do not expect a run-stop-run type of story pace. This is maintains a relatively steady pace, very unusual for an action movie. Expect the unexpected unless you are a fan of many years.Second, the acting. I am so glad they replaced Katie Holmes because I don't believe she will be able to handle the role this well. Ms Maggie Gyllenhaal, you showed us how to turn a relatively understated role into a good performance. I wish you could return in the sequel, but... sigh... So many good young actors in this movie that veteran actors, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, were outshone.A personal question to the late Mr Heath Ledger. Why did you have to die?!!!! I want to see your Joker again!! You were perfect as the Joker... no, you are the Joker! You've effectively given Joker his menace back and now, we will all be deprive of the return of this Joker. Your best work is your last. I salute you, but if you can please come back from wherever you are.... we want to see you in one of the sequels.Third, the director. Thank you.If anyone of you still have not watch this one, What the hell are you waiting for? Get off that seat and go watch a true masterpiece. I will remember this movie for years to come.",

    "reviewTitle": "New Classic",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is unlike any superhero movie that has come before it, and that includes the stellar Batman Begins. While 2005's origin story was a breakthrough with its Gothic visuals and harsh realistic tone, director Christopher Nolan's next entry in the series shatters what we've known as the walls of the superhero genre. An ensemble political thriller as much as it is a tale of revenge and derring-do, The Dark Knight is a wondrous, terrifying epic.Heath Ledger's Joker is the embodiment of all terror and rage, an evil force as illogical as a tornado, and fearless in the way only a sociopath can be. He sets his sights on Batman only because he wants the game of crime to be more fun, and wages a war of aimless chaos against Gotham while taunting Batman to reveal his face. The Joker demands that Gotham accept a life without rules, and as Dent, Gordon and Batman become increasingly desperate to stop him, they're each forced to break the rules they've lived by. The Dark Knight is peppered with lots of talk about dark vs. light, good vs. evil, freak vs. human-- familiar comic book stuff, and familiar stuff for Christopher Nolan too, he of Memento and The Prestige. Nolan believes so much in the real-world implications of Batman's story that what seems hokey in other movies feels desperately urgent here. There are lots and lots of speeches, with deeply intoned aphorisms about morality and truth, but they fit into Nolan's larger portrait of a city just barely teetering above chaos. As the Joker says near the end of the film, \"Madness is like gravityall it takes is a single push.\" Each of the main characters, the Joker included, are standing on a ledge.They say every era gets the kind of hero it deserves, and The Dark Knight is surely a superhero movie for our times, in which even the best of men can find themselves doing wrong. The hopeful exuberance of Spider-Man, made before 9/11, isn't bad in comparison; it just doesn't fit with where we are now. Nolan has shown a new way to tell a superhero story, and it may turn out to be the only way to tell a story about heroes in this troublingly amoral time. We may want our white knights, but it's the dark knight that we need.",

    "reviewBody": "I must give Christopher Nolan credit. He took a franchise that seemed doomed and rebooted it with \"Batman Begins\", taking a huge risk by making it darker and more serious. This time, now that all of the necessary background information has already been presented, he takes things one step further by making it darker, more serious, and more exciting.\"The Dark Knight\" is an unbelievably exciting, funny, and creepy movie all at the same time, and they all hit the viewer in equal amounts. Heath Ledger's performance is the masterful center of the movie, complimented wonderfully by Bale's batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Eckhart's Harvey Dent. The first half of the movie sets up so many shocking moments and take-your-breath-away action scenes that it's hard to catch your breath, but I've never felt so great hardly being able to breathe.However... the second half of the movie gets a little heavy, and to avoid spoilers I will just say that I think this movie would have worked nicely split up into two. However, that's not nearly enough to make someone forget the fact that this is the most exciting movie of the year (sorry, Iron Man) and the second movie we've seen guaranteed of an Oscar nomination (after Wall-E).

    "reviewTitle": "Action, action, action, and Heath Ledger's Oscar-worthy final performance",
    "reviewBody": "I attended a screening of \"The Dark Knight\" last night. Indies are really my preference and, at $150 million+, this Warner Brothers movie is about as Hollywood as it gets. But it's impossible not to discuss this film, especially in the light of the untimely passing of one of our most gifted actors. The Joker was Heath Ledger's final role.Pluses: Action, action, action, and more action. Did I say action? Good Lord. Guns, bombs, explosions, knives, fistfights, various other weapons, car chases, more explosions, more bombs, and more car chases.You know how in most action movies there's one great bomb/explosion scene? Something big is blown up towards the end? Well, in director/co-writer Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" it happens time and time again, all throughout the film. Not only do you not have to wait until the third act to see something huge blown to smithereens but, every time you think, \"ah, that's the big explosion of the movie,\" there's another. And another.Best of all, though, are the chases. This movie has some of the best chase scenes I've ever seen. And there's not just one. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and even helicopters are involved in some fantastic action sequences. Crashes galore. And, just like with the explosions, just when you think you've seen \"the\" big chase scene, there's another. And another.The action is relentless.There's even a love story thrown in for the ladies. And not one F-bomb. Not even an S-word. No sex. No skin. The kids will love it. Men, women, teens, all will find something to like here.Minuses: The storyline is a bit confusing. There's Batman/Bruce Wayne, the Joker, the district attorney, police commissioner, mayor, the Hong Kong businessman, the Mafia, and various other public officials and thugs. All play a role in the plot at some point, more or less, and it's hard to tell the players without a scorecard.Someone said to me, \"a comic book story and it's hard to follow?\" Well, frankly, yes. I actually wished it was a bit more mindless so that I could focus on the action. I would have preferred to use my brain less in this case, to tell you the truth. But it didn't lessen the film's impact.Christian Bale is a capable Batman. But \"The Dark Knight\" is, most of all, a tribute to Heath Ledger. His Joker and intense, maniacal portrait of him is, supposedly, what drove him to his death. As the story goes, he couldn't leave the character at the set. It haunted him day and night. It's not hard to see why. His performance is so chilling that it was hard to see him on screen and not imagine what it must have been like for him when he went home at the end of the day. Ideally, one is not supposed to be taken out of a movie -- the audience should never think about the actor instead of the character. But it was hard not to, knowing that this was the final role of his life, and one which may have contributed to ending it. That made it even more frightening.The curiosity factor will probably get people into the theaters who might not otherwise have gone. But it's just as well. It will be his legacy, or part of it, and must be seen to be believed.Is \"The Dark Knight\" the best film of the year? I don't think so. Will it make a gazillion dollars and turn out to be the #1 movie of the year? I wouldn't be surprised. Is it worth seeing? Yes, I'd recommend it to just about anyone. Does Heath Ledger deserve an Oscar? I'd say yes. His performance IS all that the hype has led you to believe it is.",

    "reviewBody": "After going into this moving hearing a great deal of hype , I had my doubts. I thought that much of the praise heaped on Ledger's performance was probably undue. (I have never particularly cared much for Heath's work in the past, although I have yet to see Brokeback.) But I was STUNNED by the quality of his performance in this film. He was genuinely dark and disturbing. His voice, his mannerisms and his intensity all served to make this Joker one of the most memorable roles of this decade. In short, he was truly outstanding! It's a good thing he was outstanding. Because while the writing was interesting and attempted to deal with the true nature of humanity, with typical comic book caricaturisation, most the other performances were not particularly strong. Christian Bale and Maggie Gyllenhaal appeared a bit flat and better suited to the previous generation of Batman movies than this one. They just weren't on the same level. Aaron Eckhart was decent and Gary Oldman was good, although the part is a little dull for him.And, as with all these movies, there were little details that were unnecessary and unrealistic. The most glaring was two-face's condition. It was just an appalling bad idea. Ib the plus side, however, most of the physics weren't particularly cartoonish, for which I am very grateful!Overall, I thought it was an excellent comic book film and I would recommend it to any adult who can deal with a bit of violence. What shortcomings the film has are overshadowed by a brilliant performance by Ledger that it makes this film a must see.",

    "reviewBody": "We all remember how good Batman Begins was, right? Well, after seeing the much anticipated (and hyped) sequel, Begins is child's play.\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're tonight's entertainment...\" The action kicks off with a bank heist that brings back memories of Michael Mann's excellent Heat (a feeling that lingered for the entire movie) and more-or-less introduces us to The Joker. Now believe me when I say that The Joker is completely mental. Heath Ledger's performance is brilliant. There's talk of an Oscar nomination, something which is very much deserved. He completely disappears into his character, perfecting the best screen villain since Hannibal Lecter. Just check out the scene with the pencil... The Joker prefers the slow kill. He is tortured by his sinister smile (and when you hear how he got it it will send shivers down your spine). But the thing that is truly sinister about him is he's not into crime for the money. The Joker kills and stirs the pot-because he can.\"This city deserves a better class of criminal... and I'm gonna give it to them!\" With praise for The Joker out of the way, it's time to acknowledge the other key players in this epic crime thriller. Morgan Freeman manages to put a new twist on his never-ending good guy roles (he was God once, for Christ's sake), Maggie Gyllenhaal is the perfect replacement for the bland Katie Holmes as Batman's long time friend and love interest Rachel Dawes, Nestor Carbonell (of Lost fame) nails the Gotham City Mayor and the awesome Michael Caine is, you guessed it, awesome as Batman's trusty butler Alfred. Another interesting point of this movie is we get insight into all of these characters, even Alfred, who's often just a plot device in previous Batman movies.\"The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming...\" Following the opening heist we see everyone's favourite troubled millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, cinema's definitive Batman) in his Bat-Suit once again cleaning the streets of Gotham, before getting the news from his close friend and clean cop James Gordon (Gary Oldman, reprising his rare good guy role from Begins) that it would be wise to work with the city's District Attourney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, perfectly cast) in their attempts to clean the streets of criminals. This begins a series of events that brings Batman to the attention of The Joker, who then plots to kill him in order to maintain criminal status of Gotham, first targeting various authority figures including the Mayor and Dent.\"So what are you proposing?\" \"It's simple: kill The Batman...\" To say much more about the plot would weaken the experience of the film, but there is one other key point of this film, and that is the dramatic rise and fall of Harvey Dent and his painfully emotional and physical transformation into Harvey Two-Face...\"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain...\" All in all, this film is perfectly written, there are action scenes a-plenty but they don't interfere with the extraordinary character development, contains brilliant performances all round, especially the power-house performance by Heath Ledger, directed with confidence and gusto by Christopher Nolan and is darkly funny for the most part, but takes itself very seriously when it comes to the drama.\"Know your limits, Master Wayne.\" \"Batman has no limits.\" The verdict: The Dark Knight is stunning. It will be regarded as one of the best movies of the noughties, if not all time. It twists the standard comic-book formula and sets the standards of every comic-book and crime-thriller movie yet to be made. In a word: perfect.",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is a great movie. Rarely does a film bring you to the edge of your seat with creeping dread but this one does. I saw it at an early show but the audience still applauded afterward. That tradition has been slowly dying out and it was nice to see a movie like this bring it back. Let's see... where to start? I'll keep this short and spoiler free.The acting was good by all involved and it's true that Leager's performance as the Joker rises above just being good. It is a great performance worthy of an Oscar. There's a part of me that's angry that drugs took away such a great actor and a bit towards him also for choosing that dangerous, worthless path. Perhaps that's selfish of me but it's also a compliment to the talent he wasted. I also liked Harvey Dent by Aaron Eckhart despite some reviews criticizing it. I am not a reader of the comic books but I found Two Face's creation story to be about as realistic as possible. I'm not sure how they could possibly top this movie in a sequel and I don't know if any other villain could live up to the standard that the Joker set here. We'll see, I guess.Realism. Let's talk about that. The success of this movie is founded upon a more realistic portrayal of Batman and Gotham and of the superhero genre in general. Sure the action is amped way, way up but the director, Tim Nolan, somehow manages to make it feel plausible enough that you stop worrying about how preposterous it all is and focus on the story. I like this new approach, the opposite of camp, and when it matches the source material, it should be used from now on. The Hellboy movies have also benefited from this. Truth: take the source seriously and you end up with a better finished product. Hollywood got something right this time even if we've had to suffer through countless superhero movies and films designed not to challenge us more than some executives think we can handle.I don't want to give anything away but this movie takes you on an emotional journey that leaves you a little exhausted at the end. It has action, suspense, terror, true love (and not true love), philosophy... and it's all woven into a complex gripping story. It is remarkable that it managed to keep so many plates spinning at once. I'm impressed.Go see this movie. See it on the big screen. You'll thank me for it. It is worthy of a second theatre viewing and I'll be going again.",

    "reviewTitle": "Amazing!!!",
    "reviewBody": "In all seriousness, this is one of the single greatest movies I have ever seen. It is truly beyond words to describe how great it is, but this is one movie that is definitely worth spending the outrageous prices of tickets these days. I went into the theater only moderately excited for the film. I was thrilled to some degree to see the new Batman movie and all, but I didn't expect to see the cinematic genius that was on the screen. The film truly had it all, fast paced action, dramatic rendering, comedic relief, and superb acting with flawless delivery, most notably by the late Heath Ledger. What surprised me the most was that this wasn't just a high budget action flick, it also made the audience think, at times it was even reminiscent of Fight Club in its affinity for making viewers examine society. I wouldn't dare spoil the film for anyone reading this, but the plot was masterfully crafted and the twists will surely leave viewers on the edge of their seats. Truly, if you see one movie this year make it this one.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight, a new kind of comic book movie",
    "reviewBody": "Last night I was privileged enough to see The Dark Knight. The local radio stations offered press screener passes in exchange for waiting in line for more than three hours (don't mock me, I was number 80 in line, number 1 got there 4 hours before I did). I had been anticipating this release for months now, and I was not let down. Before I go into specifics, let me tell you that all the hype, all the crazy viral campaigns to build up support for this movie did not oversell it. All the waiting was worth it. The Dark Knight is the best Batman movie yet. First, let's discuss the elephant in the room, Heath Ledger. There has been a lot of talk about how his portrayal of The Joker might get him an Oscar. I think there is a good chance he will. I say this because last year's Supporting actor award winner was the same level of insanity. The Joker is to The Dark Knight what Anton Chigurh is to No Country for Old Men. Instead of a villain with any moral convictions or rules or even goals, you get something almost elemental. Every time Joker is in the scene you tighten up because you don't know what he's thinking (just wait for the magic disappearing pencil scene). The acting is superb. I had to stop and remind myself who was behind that makeup. Ledger was able to take a character that is so complex and bring him to life. I will grant that the sick and twisted games played by Joker are the writing of Christopher Nolan, David Goyer, and Nolan's brother, BUT that's not what makes the Joker complete. It's all the little things. It's the way he stalks around people, the way he licks his scars, those little... quirks that make him real. One scene still gives me shivers just because of the way the Joker responds to a cop when the cop says that Joker killed six of his friends. There is almost a torture movie slant to the character. What can I do to inspire the most possible terror in this city? The relationship between Joker and Batman is very loyal to the comic books as well. Nolan doesn't even try to explain the Joker's past existence. As far as we should be concerned, he didn't exist until Batman came to Gotham city. One of the parts I loved about the movie was how Joker puts together stories of his past that keep changing. In truth, everyone seems to bring their A-game to the show. The Dark Knight adds depth to all of the characters. Gary Oldman makes Jim Gordon come alive. Hell, there's one part of the story that pretty much brought tears to my eyes concerning Gordon. Michael Caine gives more depth to Alfred, providing some clues to his background. Aaron Eckhart does a fantastic job as Harvey Dent/Two-Face (I'm assuming that's no spoiler. If you don't know Harvey Dent is Two-Face, then you shouldn't care about my review in the first place). Eckhart makes for an excellent pretty boy DA who has real thoughts and real qualms about Gordon and Batman, and his transition to Two-Face is startling. It's hard for the audience to hate him as Two-Face after we loved him as Harvey Dent. Christian Bale does some fantastic work with the Batman persona and the Bruce Wayne persona. Both have added depth and weaknesses which are addressed. The methodical detective that I have come to love about the Batman is more evident in The Dark Knight, as are the repercussions for such a life. In one scene, Bale removes his shirt, showing a series of scars all over his back. That really helps to show the hard life Batman leads. The only negative side is I don't care for the raspy voice Bale uses for Batman. I know Bale has to change his voice and make it menacing, and there are limits to the vocal abilities of a man, but when Batman is involved in lengthy dialog is seems evident Bale is having trouble with the voice. As for the story, the plot is surprisingly the main focus. This is not a comic book movie that has you waiting for the big fight scene, the plot is actually rather complex. There are a lot of elements of movies like The Godfather and The Untouchables which add depth to the story. When The Dark Knight ends, you don't feel like everything has been resolved and everything is going to be OK. It's almost upsetting, the way the movie treats these comic book characters so realistically. When Bale lifts his shirt revealing all those scars, that's how everyone ends up when the credits roll. Remember how the sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean decided to add complexity to the plot and ended up making the whole thing such an incomprehensible mess in those 2 1/2 hours? The Dark Knight does not do that. All of the plot lines are kept in order and there is very little quick explanations. One thing about the movie that I enjoyed was the realism of the action. There was no crazy kung-fu or spectacular acrobatics involved. The fighting was kept very realistic. Actually, the way the Joker fought was just as creepy as his acting. \"You've changed things... forever. There's no going back.\" I think when Nolan wrote that line it was more for himself. See, this movie is different. It's not a movie about superheroes fighting super villains. It's rough and gritty and you come out feeling a little disturbed. I think this movie is going to be much like Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, a new age of realism and adult themes in these movies. I would like any adult friends of mine to see this film, but keep the kids out. The Dark Knight's PG-13 rating should be R. This isn't like Saturday morning cartoons.",

    "reviewTitle": "One of the greatest sequels ever made",
    "reviewBody": "When i witnessed the hype of The Dark Knight rising and all the images of Heath Ledger's joker and the campaign posters for Eckharts Dent Portrayal i thought only one thing. This could be one of those great sequels, you know the one's that overpower the original with acting and style, letting the depth of character overtake the explosions and bigger/better mentality of most sequels. (for example see, Godfather part 2, Empire Strikes Back etc)After watching it i was proved right. First off. Making the Batman franchise a crime epic is a sure fire way of hooking in an audience, the level of style mixed with the origin of Batman, a dark inner turmoil character bent on making the future of a city a little bit brighter, and then pitting him against crime boss' and a maniac hit-man. This gives the movie a brilliant storyline. Then the storyline is flipped on it's head for having the Harvey Dent character become Batman's way out from all the wrong thing's that went with his path. (such as copycat innocent folk getting killed and vigilante justice not being as sweet as it seems). The direction is as if Nolan was watching Heat and other Michael Mann flicks off set and taking that style, there's no definitive comic book feel to it, it's just pure grit. The best thing about The Dark Knight is the haunting Heath Ledger, every scene he's in there is no way you can take your eye's off of him. until Two Face comes in, then it's a whole different story entirely. I just want to give a mention to the opening scene, it sets up a pure crime saga start and then later there's a scene that cannot be missed by any lover of great tracking shots. I'm annoyed i couldn't have witnessed it in an Imax theatre. The Dark Knight is what comic book movies should have been, dark, moral, and entertaining as all hell. There's a little disbelief to be suspended, but who cares. One of the greatest sequels of movie history.",

    "reviewTitle": "REVIEW: The Dark Knight",
    "reviewBody": "In 2005, Christopher Nolan with a very committed and talented cast and crew set out to make an amazing 'crime noir' film that was gestured to remaining true to the values of artistic and quality cinema, whilst committing to mass-commercial appeal by incorporating a famed character from the DC Comics franchise and honouring a darker, grittier, intense and mature rendition of a Graphic Novel theme with 'Batman Begins'. The result was one that received mass acclaim and generated a feeling throughout film-goers everywhere that this was a Comic Book tie-in film that was, unanimously, a force to be reckoned with - a total triumph! - with a complete rollicking epic story, interesting characters, memorable moments, justified action and responses to a situation that one man - with an ideal - could change things...Forever...Now there's no going back...Introducing 'The Dark Knight' - following the events of 'Batman Begins', we now find Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) pushed to his limits emotionally, physically and especially ethically under the severity of a new force of criminal in town... a man with no rules and no response to authority... a man who quite simply, is in it 'for kicks' and would gladly watch the world burn in a blaze of white hot chaos... a man who is as mysterious as the 'smile on his face' - The Joker (Heath Ledger in an amazing, potential Oscar blazing final performance). The Joker only has one real ambition and that is to satisfy his ego by 'killing the Batman' and hopefully, along the way, allowing him to unveil his identity to the world... he will do whatever it takes to destroy Gotham's greatest vigilante, even if it means that he destroys everything (including himself) in process. This is the main challenge to 'The Dark Knight' - do I become one of them to stop this ultimate evil? Or do I persevere? Let them hate me for not giving in and going against all I stood for? What I deem right over wrong? When is too far... too far? ...Incorporate an amazing, complex plot with all the trimmings of 'crime epic', interesting flawed characters, an evil that is, somewhat, sympathetic and ethical issues that will have you questioning the 'The Dark Knight' himself... even though you know the answer... it is one of the most satisfying and intense films ever made, quite simply, brilliant! The performances from the support cast including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent (who renders an amazing character in 'Two-Face'), Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth - the voice of reason, Morgan Freeman - as Lucius Fox - an inventor of great intelligence and moral grounding, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes - the conflicting love interest and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Jim Gordon (in a well-rounded and an amazing performance) as Batman's greatest ally, they all work well within their roles and add to the drama and the emotional impact that this film needs to rise it well above just 'ordinary'...This is perhaps, the most anticipated film of the year, and believe me, it was worth every painful moment of consistent waiting...For those who are curious to know if questions are answered, you may be surprised - I won't give anything away! For the sceptics, believe me - trust the hype on this one - it will not disappoint! This is one of the most well-rounded, action-packed, justifiable and memorable films ever made! Go see it and actually 'experience' a film once again... It's such a great feeling! RATING: 9.5 / 10",

This movie is awesome, anybody who was a fan of the Batman Begins will easily be a fan of this movie.The plot is solid, and the acting what can I say extraordinary, Christian Bale put in an excellent performance with Batman. But the best performance hands down would have to go to Heath Ledger as the Joker. He is quite the villain and is very funny The ending for this film is great, and Is not a predictable ending. And after the movie finishes you get that sense of disbelief. This is probably the best Batman movie ever.",

    "reviewBody": "I'm in Thailand which has a release date of today, so I actually saw this film. My feelings are somewhat mixed. It does succeed as a hard action film, but was definitely too long. The joker character is truly terrifying this time around and the film's tone is appropriately violent and dark - both figuratively and literally, much of the action takes place at night. The script caters for the American audience by making the joker and his cronies less criminals and more terrorists - who are probably what Americans are most concerned about. This made it less appealing for me. Much better than average, but still not more than 7 out of 10.",

The muscular storytelling, intense action, impeccable production, direction, and the ensemble cast, are all on their best game. Ledger is a revelation. Arguably, it's his best performance, and the performance of the year. His Joker will live on as the most vital villain to hit the big screen in years and for many, many more years to come. The magnitude of the finale in 'Knight' is emotionally deep, haunting and inspiring. \"The Dark Knight\" will rattle the senses and linger in your thoughts long after.",

    "reviewTitle": "Stand up and applaud the Joker...",
    "reviewBody": "This is a movie that goes beyond a lone superhero fighting comic book villains in a fictional city. Its a brilliantly directed masterpiece that will leave you gasping and starring at the screen when the credits roll. Like the first movie Christian Bale brings his strong persona to the billionaire Bruce Wayne who uses Batman as a symbol to bring justice in Gautham.However this movie isn't just about Batman, its also centered around someone else, someone far more complicated and dark. The Joker.Nolan and the late Heath Ledger give the Joker a dimension I have never seen before in a villain. Ledger's performance is nothing short of brilliant, breathtaking and aw-inspiring; almost as if he is drawing upon the demons within himself to portray the Joker. He is the most believable villain I have ever seen on the Big Screen and he will scare you from the first time he appears in the movie. As brilliant as Christian Bale is in the movie he is over-shadowed by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Every time the Joker is on screen the movie has a feeling of its own. It moves away from being an action flick based on a comic and becomes something much more dramatic and complex. Like Batman you get lost trying to figure out the joker and reason behind his demented personality and his haunting crimes. If Heath Ledger doesn't get an Oscar for this role I don't know who will.Other supporting actors also provide strong performances. Aaron Eckhart is very good as Harvey Dent/Two face and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as always do a great job as well. The only week link in this movie for me was Maggie Gyllenhaal, like Katey Holmes in Batman Begins she doesn't quite hit the nail on the head.Nothing I can say in this short review will give you the true idea of how good this movie is or what its is really about. Its so much more that any of the previous Batman movies. Its a perfect balance of action, drama, suspense and quite brilliant acting and direction. This movie is a must see whether you are a Batman fan or not because the chances are that by the end of it, you will be standing and applauding.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Comic Book Movie Ever",
    "reviewBody": "Of course I have not seen every comic book movie. I know that but of all the movies I have seen, this is by far the best. The dark side of this movie is so deep that at times it is hard to believe parents would take their 13-year-old kids to see this movie. Personally I would have nightmares if I was 13. Christian Bale pulls the batman role off perfectly. The joker leaves me speechless in every scene. There are no corny one-liners like you expect from a comic book movie: this is not Iron Man or Spider Man (although I did enjoy Iron Man). This series is so much more serious and creepier than the previous batman movies. Just looking at the Joker puts a chill down your spine. Seeing the events in the movie are enjoyable for everyone, you don't have to be a fan of the batman comics or comic books to include this movie in your all time favorites. I am not going to give Heath Ledger pity points. I have been excited about him playing the Joker since they announced it and he has lived up to my expectations and far surpassed them. I would not take your 7 year old boy to see this movie. PG-13 in this case means it. Heath Ledger's character is far scarier than any comic book villain I have ever seen. The dark parts of this movie make it unbelievable. Perhaps this is my personality speaking; my favorite album of all time is \"The Downward Spiral\" by Nine Inch Nails; but after seeing this movie Wednesday night I went home and listened to the entire album (not going to bed until past 5 am). When the credits start rolling and you see it read \"In memory of our friends Heath Ledger and Conway Wickliffe\" it hits you that Ledger is dead. This is his best performance (excluding \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\") and it makes you realize how brilliant he was and what a loss it is for him to be gone. But don't go into the movie with that on your mind. Enjoy the movie. I did. Is it my favorite movie of all time? No. But it is definitely in my top five.",

The summer started off with some great superhero movies with the exception of Hancock, Iron Man and the Hulk were very well made so it only seems right that Batman would rock the house and set a new standard for superhero movies. What I like about the Dark Knight is that is humanizes batman and sheds light on the difficulties and traumas of being mortal and human unlike Super man or Spider man, Batman and Iron Man are just men which makes the stories and movies so relate-able and believable to a certain extent.",

The Oscar talk surrounding his performance is well deserved. Bale is superb as Batman and even better as Wayne. Caine,Oldman and Freeman are at the top of their game. But the steal of the film for me was Aaron Eckhardt. His performance as Harvey Dent is brilliant. I don't want to spoil anything here - just a truly masterful film - along the lines of The Departed and Heat. 10 out of 10.",

    "reviewBody": "DARK KNIGHT 1st of all, I must admit that my expectation on TDK was high. In fact very high. Here my reviews............ THIS FILM WAS SERIOUSLY INTERPRETING IN DEPTH THE DARKEST SIDE OF BATMAN WORLD IN PARALLEL TO THE TAGLINE!! which answered the question \"WHY SO SERIOUSSSSSS?' ONE Thing and without doubt,THE Oscar GOES TO......................... OUR LATE HEATH LEDGER!!!!!!!I was so surprised with the opening 5 minutes, which defines JOKER characters in the film. And very impressed with JOKER(Ledger) character as scarily psychotic plus sadistically maniac villain. Ledger stealing every scene he appears in and truly convince us that he was the perfect actor to play that roles. Damn!!! I ended seeing JOKER face in my mind when I woke up this morning and every time I think about TDK. Forget about Jack Nicholson!! Ledger: Best performance in his life. So sad Heath ended with this as his last film. Bale did great but not good as he performed in Batman Begins. Maybe the focus in this sequel is to the TWO FACE AND JOKER. GORDON(GARY), LUCIUS(FREEMAN) was great truly play their part very well. RACHEL(MAGGIE GYLLENNHAAL)AND HARVEY(ECKHART) was averaged. ECKHART expression change when he plays darker side in which he really delivered. THE ACTION and MOMENTUM was excellent and really brilliant especially at the middle. Almost forgot about BATPOD'S....It was really stunning and awesome. Moved in fast-pace Nolan's proved that he can do it twice for this comic adaption movies. It's hard to direct superheroes action sequel without taking consideration the story from the comic itself and to disregard Batman die-hard fans. To me, Nolan succeeded. ALTHOUGH, it was 2 and half hours, sometimes it was rushing especially at the end. PLUS, something must be wrong with scripts or plots transition which interfered me. Maybe unessential parts should be short. And plot transition was not so tidy like BATMAN BEGINS. The ending was simple, sames as BB. There wasn't any plot twist at the ends that could make you 'Forgettable'. No applauds when the credit starts, maybe audience is still shock. If Ironman was fun, this one was well enjoyable and entertaining movies. Deserve, BEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER MADE. I'll be watching it for 2nd time this weekend and eagerly waiting for DVD's release date. TDK 9.49999/10!!!!!!!!!!",

James Gordon....Now Christian Bale, well he is great, he is a great actor, i love his voice as Batman, it's so different than Bruce Wayne voice. But, i think that in this movie he didn't came up to the scene to much, i mean like in the Batman Begins, 'cos in Batman Begins he's practically all the movie in scene. But this is because this movie is more focused in The Joker.My favorite Quote from the movie is::(The Joker to Batman)\"You've Changed Things... Forever. There's No Going Back. See, To Them, You're Just A Freak... Like Me!\"A great movie.......very very damn good!!!",

    "reviewBody": "I went to watch this movie with huge expectations and this movie didn't disappoint at all. The acting was extremely well played. The story was solid but i thought the movie could have wrapped up quite earlier. I am not a huge fan of comic book movies with recent disasters such as Spider-Man 3 amongst others but this takes story telling, action, acting to a new level for Comic Book Movies. This can be easily rated as the best comic book movie ever. Definitely need to watch this movie in the cinemas. All awards for Heath Ledger coming from this movie will be justified. It will be an utter shock if he doesn't get best actor lead or supporting actor nod. I think he had more screen time that Batman itself and he didn't disappoint. I would strongly recommend to watch this movie in the cinemas, anything else wont give it justice.",

    "reviewBody": "What can I say?? It's a marvelous super hero movie ever made. Let me comment from the lead roles, Christian Bale was really good in both Bruce Wayne and Batman. His acting capability and maturity impresses again after the Prestige. Heath Ledger wow!! Oscar for this guy is a definite; I think it explains all about him.Aaron Eckhart really brought up Harvey Dent's character to real. And the story turning him to Two-Face is brilliant, even comic is not better than this. Gary Oldman playing Gordon suits him as how it was in Batman Begins. Eric Roberts, nothing new for him playing mafia.Christopher Nolan proved that super hero movie does not necessary to be action all the way, but a lot of values can be seen here. Just name it drama, action, thriller and moral values you can find it all here.I think this will be the first comic Super Hero movie to win Oscar for best picture and lead roles.Bravo!!!",

    "reviewBody": "Solid, enjoyable, kinetic...Thumbs up to all involved...Won't give anything away...Just sat in a preview screening, and walked on the streets of Gotham.Obviously much debate now will be about whether all the buzz about Heath Ledger's performance, is due to sympathy, or a truly demented performance. I strongly believe, and argue for, the latter...In two words, \"Heath Legend\". The Joker was already an iconic role, so there was always going to be attention and close scrutiny (never mind having to step out of, or rather further into, Jack Nicholson's shadow), the man from Down Under doesn't disappoint.Though the stage does not belong to one man alone; let's not forget Batman (Bale, solid work Jedi). Gary Oldman's Gary GOLDman as usual. I believe in Harvey Dent.Thumbs up to everyone. From Nolan right down to the P.A.'s sweeping the floors, I stayed right through the credits out of respect, and pure cinematic marination...",

    "reviewTitle": "Why So Serious? When You Can Smile Because The Dark Knight Is Here And Because It Is Fantastic",
    "reviewBody": "When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burton's Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with that tape), a 1989 film that I haven't watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for Jack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker makeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack Nicholson about the \"new\" joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he should have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I saw The Dark Knight, on a midnight \"special\" screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories of Nicholson's joker, I really don't remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledger's joker on the screen; he is absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolan's Batman, the second take and definitely my favourite of all the Batman films. Ledger's joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are just waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is the joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of Gotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement (the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one in who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City but at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in this way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since I only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of Gotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And the joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable in the film; I loved that the joker's origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and maybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is not very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level \"regular\" persons and he succeeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because of his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation. On this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty and the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I write before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write before too, the joker's movements are just to follow and even we you don't expect anything he puts to the civilians the clown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is kind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all the performances in this film with only one word: great (I didn't missed Holmes and I'm glad that Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again).The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the unique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the first minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight screenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and that there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer. I'm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film ever. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly fantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Don't miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!",

    "reviewTitle": "Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, all hit it out of the park",
    "reviewBody": "I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole \"Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance\" hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real \"origin\" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are \"jokingly\" referenced that \"my dad did this, \"my wife did this\"), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than \"I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here\"). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the \"white knight\", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking \"say it isn't so\", and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure \"fun\" of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.",

    "reviewTitle": "Where do I begin?",
    "reviewBody": "Where do I begin? The film was hyped ever since reviews started filtering out about Heath Ledger's final performance. The film, as well as his performance, has been lauded. I was slightly skeptical, but still highly anticipating film and my expectations were very high. Well they were met and exceeded. I have to agree with those reviews comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back. It is that equivalent to the superhero genre. The overtones are darker than Batman Begins, which was a great stepping-stone for this incredible and epic storytelling of two masterful nemeses for Batman, The Joker and Two-Face. However, the film did not get lost in the dark and still holds a great sense of humor to alleviate much of the pain of the film.To begin with, Batman is having troubles carrying over from the first film. The narrows was lost and he is still trying to collect the criminals who escaped including Scarecrow / Jonathan Crane in small cameo appearance, which really was only weak point of the film. For a villain given so much story time in the first film, it felt disappointing to see him carelessly tossed aside here as he was at the end of Begins. I digress on that, matter though as it is overall a minor disappointment. As he is finishing business with Scarecrow it also shown, that Batman has inspired others to follow him in his \"vigilante\" activities. He is not pleased at this. It is not what he intended when he donned the mask. However, the vigilantes inspired by him are not the real beef.The Joker and first the mob is the first beef. Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon are cracking down on the mob hard forcing them to launder their money to one man. Pounding them into a corner, this proves most deadly for a city already having major problems. Into this deadly net waltz the ultimate in chaos theory. The Joker, a mad hatter and the anti-thesis of Batman, who not only follows not rules, but also has no qualms about doing what Batman will not, kill and kill without remorse. He is a mad man and sadistic and still one the enigma he is from the comics, something that Jack Nicholson had ruined for him back in 1989. Unlike him, Heath Ledger is aloud to play the role savagely and therefore, cannot be compared to Nicholson's lighter Joker. He is unto a class all his own in the Batman universe. Anarchy and madness that is what Ledger plays Joker as and deftly too, as advertised a complete screwball whose actions have no rhythm and no bounds. He is the showman of the film, but overblown. Still one cannot help but laugh with him as the film goes up to the point when he kills.While Joker plays the villain of the film, the film offers three main lead heroes whom through the course of the film are tested to their limits by the Joker bound by none. There is the incorruptible Batman, the stalwart James Gordon, and the newcomer District Attorney Harvey Dent. All played just as well as Ledger's Joker making the film are a fantastic film to watch as the four men butt heads. Individually they do it with the Joker as well as together. It is the heart and soul of the film. The three heroes most especially Harvey Dent represent the goodness of Gotham. That is something that is tried to the edge by the Joker. It is through the performances of Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart that the film flourishes dramatically.Extraneously on the side, there is the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Rachel Dawes, and Harvey Dent, but only alongside the main one of the heart of the city and the triangle of Batman, Gordon, and Dent. Above all Gotham is what must survive and that is what Joker makes at stake as much as Ra's al Ghul did in Begins. Therefore, the love story takes a back seat, but it is not overlooked in the 2 hours and 40 minutes that the film runs. It covers a lot of ground with lots of twists and turns and it does not miss a beat and way to tie up a loose end, save for Cillian Murphy's ever suffering Scarecrow.The technical makeup of the film is equally as stunning as the film story and makes it astounding strong in all respects. Add to that the perfect melding of countless comics and portrayals in the performances here and the film falls into place as the pinnacle the Batman film series has to offer to date.",

    "reviewTitle": "A dark vision almost perfect",
    "reviewBody": "While I write this I'm still immensely impressed with the forcefulness of this film, there are really few action or adventure movies that will create what \"The Dark Knight\" gets in just a few minutes, and that is to bring the climax of emotions with a script that is strengthened in each of its lines and with an edition that frame after frame doesn't exist any wastage. Anything that we had heard about this film before its premiere, all these positive comments that the criticism launched after having seen it, all the positive references are true, very true. To begin with, the action sequences are a visual choreography, in each one's emotions are as much as possible, because not only are loaded by a perfect use of special effects, explosions and an audio editing forceful, but also because Bale, and Heath Ledger above all, build two characters who represent two sides of the coin and their clashes are so catastrophic that makes everything a witness from the edge of the seat. And is that really the performances are at the level of what anyone could expect, but definitely this is the film of The Joker. Either that, including me, thought that no one could deprive the best interpretation of this murderer to Jack Nicholson, really we have our mouths open to the strength, vitality and terror that manages to combine Ledger villain in this, I confess at times was too crazy up to me, and that is what succeeds, it succeeds really that you think that this man is a man without any kind of moral questioning, everything for him is a macabre game. So Joker works well because it also has a dramatic, dark and vertiginous screenplay that unfolds quickly to each of the characters and at the same time, for that speed with which everything happens, forcing the viewer to be attentive to each of the sequences, each of the planes, and the richness of this script is that even if it is full of action is also an ode about a moral antihero, that make you think about the various faces of good and evil, and leads to comic character to a much more psychological level, reflected whenever Joker and Batman exchange lines, and which culminates with a hopeful end even when circumstances suggest quite the opposite and balance between the two sides of the coin has been broken. That's because the script is really something worthwhile, for all Batman, The Joker, Harvey Dent and James Gordon mean and represent. The film is not an idealistic and beautiful portrait of a hero, is a dark film about a man who loads a weight of being a hero that nobody wants, is the battle of a man in front of the chaos, is the fascination of anarchy and violence and hope that lies even after the cataclysm. Yes, it has its errors of continuity, some holes in the plot, but not all opaque this marvelous film. This is a great film in a genre in which there seemed no room for maturity, for the visual beauty that has made the best Batman film.",

    "reviewTitle": "Oh sweet merciful Lord, that there can actually be sequels that surpass the originals",
    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie, just last night, at an advanced screening for the theater. I was not terribly looking forward to it initially because I figured it was just another Batman movie. Yes, Christopher Nolan was directing it and he also directed the movie that renewed my faith in the Batman series (Batman Begins), but it was just another sequel in my mind. wait for it to come to DVD, I thought. So my friend got me a free ticket to this screening and I went. All I can say is this (and I am not exaggerating): It Is THE Best Superhero Movie EVER. A true psychological thriller, Nolan slowly builds the suspense, terror and madness each minute you watch. At first, Oh sure it's the Joker. Biiig deal, he kills some of his own henchmen. But gradually, the diabolical mind behind the clownface emerges (demonstrated absolutely flawlessly by the late Heath Ledger). Batman, played by Christian Bale, is as dark and brooding as he was in Begins. His gadgetry and the quality of his costume is improving, but he is also gaining admirers in some strange places as small-time criminals begin to emulate him--something he refuses to accept, they ARE criminals after all. Bale's portrayal is perfect. Vengeful anti-hero by night, Billionaire jackass by day. In this movie, he is charged with cleaning up the mob from the Gotham City streets. Utilizing the legal powers of Dent and Gordon's access to city officials, he does this, clearing Gotham of the scum in one magnificent swoop. Hooray for our hero. Fortunately, the movie does not end there. A string of deaths occurs, all masterminded by the same diabolical villain and Batman makes it his personal quest to rid the world of the Joker. As people begin to blame him for the mounting hysteria, Bruce Wayne begins to falter. Drawing into himself, he tries to shoulder the responsibility onto Dent more and more. But Dent has a weakness, the same one Bruce does. And when she dies, with Dent listening over a radio, it is the final straw breaking for him. Maggie Gylenhaal portrays the role of Rachel Dawes, thankfully, grabbing it from the poor acting of Katie Holmes. Rachel's role is fairly minor, unfortunately, but there really is no back story to her. Not in the comic anyway. While Gylenhaal is there, she plays a much better Rachel than Holmes...though that is not saying much. Aaron Eckhardt, a man I almost immediately recognized from his role as the main character of \"Thank You For Smoking\", plays the 'White Knight of Gotham', D.A. Harvey Dent. This is a man destined to plummet into the depths of complete and utter insanity, as the villain Two-Face. Everyone in the theater saw it coming when he did. That doesn't take away from Eckhardt's portrayal of the driven Dent, who allies with Batman and James Gordon to rid Gotham City of the Mob. He is equally magnificent in his fall. I never forgave Tommy Lee Jones for destroying my vision of Two-Face in Batman Forever...but there were a lot of mistakes in that movie. I digress. Two-Face may be a psychotic, but he is NOT a giggling, twerpy psychotic. He retains Dent's drive and powerful charisma. Eckhardt and Nolan flesh this out beautifully. But all of this pales in comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker. The movie may be about Batman, but it is the Joker's movie, without question. I had always felt that Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker was done well. It was cartoonish to Ledger's maniacal villain. From the outset, as he so deviously states, he is out to \"send a message.\" The message is that anyone in this \"sophisticated\" society that we cling to can fall to his depths with just the right push. His very demeanor was so creepy and so histrionic that it had everyone in the theater on the edges of their seats. And he wins, in spades, as he finds a way of turning Gotham's \"greatest hope\" and the man Batman sees as his public face, into something similar to him. Ledger, for those two and a half hours, is the embodiment of the chaos of the Joker. He captivates. It may be the most incredible bit of acting I have ever seen.But don't take my word for it. Go see the movie.",

    "reviewBody": "Warning!! ( Many spoilers)First Tim Burton directed two films opening the legacy. Next, Joel Schumacher continued two more films, but for lesser quality. Now Chris Nolan has made \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight,\" something to treasure forever.There are three things that won me over with this movie. First, this film pushes the envelope to a near R-Rating. There so much gunfire, explosions, and gruesome images that I felt tensed of what would happen next. I love movies that take risks because if more movies exercised play-safe techniques, we would be watching \"Batman and Robin\" all over again. Second is Heath Ledger's brilliant performance. Although less comical, ledger's character is realistic, menacing, and truly horrifying. A true psychopath, which Ledger brings so much realism. Even if there is no posthumous Oscar nomination, Ledger will most definitely live on as a movie legend. Not a single online hater complaining about the film's length, darkness, or complex story can take away Ledger's status. Finally the third thing is the film has first-rate storytelling. There is a surprise twist and a nail-biting action sequence at every corner. The action is also evenly balanced with the plot and characterization. Its more than just a good v.s. evil film. There is real conflict and real turmoil that plays on both sides of law enforcers and law violators. The film concerns Batman/Bruce Wayne trying to make the city a better place. while crooks and copycat vigilantes run amok, the Joker associates himself with powerful crime bosses. Through countless terrorist attacks, the Joker commands the citizens of Gotham to do whatever he wants as long as he controls their fears and emotions. Sometimes there is no clear motive or explanation about the Joker's past, but he wants to unmask Batman and try to make him appear villainous in the face of Gotham. The Joker is anything but a two-dimensional villain. He had a conflicted childhood just like Bruce, but he uses his angst, his rage, and his emotions to hurt others rather than protect them. Bruce Wayne on the other hand soon wants to hang up his Batman suit and settle with his love Rachel Dawes, since DA Harvey Dent is leading a revolution against all citywide crime. That is until later, when Harvey Dent makes a transformation into the monstrous Two-Face. Who is just as scary and sinister as the Joker. From that moment onward its a crazy roller coaster ride of thrills, unpredictability, and tragedy.Although the movie is long, there is sharp editing, outstanding performances, great stunt work, a superb script, and enough memorable moments to make the 2.5 hours zip by.

    "reviewBody": "I just saw The Dark Knight and it was even better than I expected and I expected it to be great. Most of this comment is about Heath Ledger so let me start by giving Christian Bale and the rest of the awesome cast, director,make-up,special effects team, writers, producers, and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in, and on this movie.Now for Ledger. People can say what they want about Heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it just isn't true. Alive or gone, this was the performance of a lifetime. The make-up, the laugh, the mannerisms, every little thing he did was perfect. I have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. I love Jack Nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive, but I am sorry Jack because Heath Ledger just out shined you and that is not easy to do.I was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have just been too symbolic and I would have lost it. I did cry at the end though. The ending when two face, the commissioner and batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled Heath Ledger's untimely passing.It is completely unfair that Heath's family and the world are going to miss out on such an amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent I have ever seen. I am a single mother and I can't even begin to imagine losing my daughter, so my heart goes out to Heath's family and his daughter. I am truly sorry that such an amazing man died so young.Dahr Prince",

    "reviewTitle": "An excellent followup to Batman Begins",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight was a very good follow up to Christopher Nolan's first batman film Batman begins. I watched this last night and enjoyed it pretty much but it didn't really blew me away as compared to Tim Burton's version of Batman. I enjoyed it particularly because of the acting, music, atmosphere which were phenomenal. I gave it 8 stars because I wasn't really into this whole \"dark\" batman thing and Jack Nicholsan as Joker was deeply etched in my memory ever since I watched it when I was only 6. The movie started of with a bang with Joker(Heath Ledger) as he robs a bank and killing his accomplices one by one so which led him to leaving with the entire amount of money robbed that day. Joker wasn't actually in need of the money, he was robbing mainly for the thrill of it as could be seen later in the movie when he burns down a mountain of cash. Heath ledger did an amazing job as acting the downright evil, corrupt, insane, psychotic nemesis of batman as he goes all out his way against what batman upholds: justice, even to the point where he made Harvey Dent aka half-face( Aaron Eckhart) a villain to Gotham city who was previously deemed as \"white knight\" of Gotham. Comparing it to Jack Nicholsan's rendition of Joker, Heath Ledger's version of Joker was more scary, evil and less funny which was similar to the later versions of the comic book.Besides Heath Ledger, the rest of the cast were excellent. Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our Caped Crusader as he struggles between his 2 personalities of being a rich heir and an upholder of justice which also puts his relationship with Rachel Dawes on the rocks.Aaron Eckhart also did an amazing job as \"white knight.\" His sense of justice was also what brought him and Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) together. However, the loss of his love and with Joker's mind-playing, he was drove to insanity and became the villain that he would have previously hated. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent's as he struggles with emotions, justice and insanity brought Half-face to another level.Maggie Gyllenhaal did great replacement for Katie Holmes as Wayne's love interest Rachel Dawes, as she shows more sensitive and caring side towards Bruce but chose Harvey in the end. Michael Caine(Alfred) also delivered as the loyal butler who cares and took care of Bruce as well as Morgan Freeman(Lucius Fox), aiding Batman in the remake of his batsuit, batmobile and use of equipments and technology. Gary Oldman( Lt. James Gordon) also deserves an applaud as Batman's sidekick and police officer as both track down Joker.In short, this is probably one of the best 2008 films but not without its flaws. Firstly, there were too many characters for the given time. Both Joker and Batman were supposedly the main cast but so was Harvey. I wished that he was given more screen time as half-faced because the ending seemed a little rushed. There should be more acknowledgement to his role. Secondly, there were times where I got confused as the film progresses and I couldn't understand the discussions between La(Chinese mobster)and Bruce as well as the significance of Joker's killings. True he killed them to lure out Batman but I couldn't understand why he chose them. I feel that this film will appeal to audiences of a larger age group or those who read the comics. Teenagers might find it hard to understand. I had problems with it initially but after the movie, when I pieced everything together, then it started to make sense.",

    "reviewTitle": "Above any of the highest expectations",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan is the master storyteller of the new millennium. I haven't seen any film of his that I could not give a perfect rating to and The Dark Knight is no exception. Any bias toward comic book characters aside this is a masterpiece of epic proportions. I recommend that those who hate comic books give it a see because The Dark Knight feels as authentic in human emotion as any drama could ever be.The anticipation for this film begins and ends with Heath Ledger as the Joker and I must say it is an electrifying performance. If Ledger gets a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards it won't be out of pity, his Joker will easily be remembered as one of the most scary villain in motion picture history. There is no limit to what this monster of a character is capable of and the audience on the edge of their seat every time he is on screen because we know he will push the bar a little farther. I consider myself to be well read in the Batman universe and I knew that they were basing a lot of the character here off of the iconic Killing Joke and even I was left unprepared and aghast by what Ledger does. The Dark Knight is not for kids, hell even some smart adults will have to drop their jaws at what this Joker does. He is frightening, genuinely frightening. Praise most be given to Nolan as well because he is careful not to use too much of this Joker by over exploiting him with excessive screen time, he gets the same amount of screen time as a lot of the ensemble cast but it is worth it. All too often are good villain killed by too much screen time and every time the Joker is on screen he is as fresh and scary as he was before. This Joker really is a great collaboration between the outstanding script and an actor who does everything exactly right with it.Ledger isn't the only great performance though. Every actor takes this material extremely seriously and there isn't a bad performance in this movie. In fact there are some career performances in here besides for Ledger's, Aaron Eckhardt is outstanding as the tragic Harvey Dent. I was somewhat hesitant to the casting of Eckhardt, he hasn't really impressed me in anything before but I couldn't imagine anyone doing more with this character. The CGI used to create the Two Face character is somewhat fake looking but Eckhardt doesn't skip a beat when a lesser performance would be overshadowed by Two-Face's visuals. Gary Oldman is given more to do as Jim Gordon and this performance isn't just a notch in the belt for Oldman. He makes Gordon one of his most well rounded characters and one who is as tested by the Joker's anarchy as Batman and Dent.The script brings Batman to brave new places. Bale is terrific in the lead role but the lead role is different than it was before. We have never seen Batman as dark in his characterization than he is in this film. Batman is pushed past his limits and he becomes darker in his methods and along the way he loses the people he cares about. By the end of the film he is paranoid and uses his friend Lucius Fox's technology to spy on the people of Gotham to find the Joker's location. If The Dark Knight has a central theme it is that of justice and Bruce Wayne comes to realize that he will be alone in his quest for justice. The Joker tries to make his opponents more like him and he succeeds in turning Dent into the monster Two-Face but he also tests Batman. He questions Batman about his one rule in his exploits and we know that if Batman kills the Joker he will become him. The Joker delivers the classic lines stating that the two complete each other and that they will end up carrying out their war both not breaking who they are.CGI and the visuals often plague films like this and Nolan tries his hardest to make you believe that this could happen in our world and for that I most praise him. The Dark Knight is a story drenched in humanity and because of this Batman is the greatest superhero we have ever seen. Sure you could get bitten by a spider or build an Iron suit but that doesn't make you human. Batman is human and goes through hell in his crusade and for that he is the greatest superhero.",

    "reviewTitle": "Awesome",
    "reviewBody": "This is a fantastic comic book/superhero movie  easily my favorite. The actors are very good, especially some of the minor roles. The action, gadgets  every staple of Batman Begins  is there in full force and better looking than ever. The movie is gorgeous.The real highlight of this movie is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Some might be under the impression that all the talk and hype about his performance leading up to the theatrical release was because of his unfortunate early death. That impression, however, is definitely not accurate. Ledger's Joker is everything that was hyped and promised and then some. It is simply spectacular.Thanks in a large part to Ledger, Dark Knight is surprisingly emotional. There are parts that are (unsurprisingly) dark. But the mannerisms of the Joker and what he thinks and what he says are extremely funny. He has the ability to instantly change the tone of a scene  something that Nolan used to great effect.My only real (but small) complaint is that there are a few problems with the otherwise strong story. Dark Knight's plot does not seem as controlled as Batman Begins  the pacing of some sections is a little off. Also, Joker was an agent of chaos, destroying other's plans because he hates control, yet his actions were superbly planned  \"it's all part of the plan.\" This criticism may be superficial, but there's no need to get into the deeper philosophy of the movie here other than to say it is engaging and fun.In short, if you love good action with a good story with great acting, this is definitely a must see. Ledger's performance is fantastic  in my opinion, it deserves piles of awards.10/10",

    "reviewBody": "This movie was: 1. Way too long. 2. Way way too long. 3. Tried to do too much. 4. Made me believe that Jake Gyllenhall is a more believable love interest than his sister. Sorry , she's just very plain looking and a mediocre actress at best. 5. Lost the dialog in an overwhelming music score. 6. Had a horrible script. 7. Ledger is the best thing about the film - but no one could live up to the hype. Sadly he will not be able to reprise this role. 8. Put every good scene in the trailers and fooled everyone by doing so. 9.The people who made this knew it is a stinker and sold it hard on the Net. 10. Had an over and over and over feel to it - I started looking at my watch about 45 minutes into the movie and about every 10 minutes thereafter. I thought it would never end and then the ending was blah.I have read stuff here about Maggie Gyllenhall being a BETTER actress that Katie Holmes. Well she may be but Katie Holmes was much more believable than she was in the role. She was unwatchable. She ruined the movie for me because no one could believe that she was being fought over by two handsome men. I almost puked when the Joker says \"Hello Beautiful\", and some one in the theater actually called out \"She's a beast !\".The first movie was great. This one , just really disappointing.Go see it. I won't have such high expectations again.The honest vote should be a 5 - but I lowered it to account for the deluded and blind.",

    "reviewTitle": "Bringing back credibility to the action blockbuster...",
    "reviewBody": "Just got back from seeing this, I was originally going to see it after the w/e, but I was bored today so I watched 'Begins', then I had to go see this as soon as I could.There is very little that's bad with this movie. The acting, the pacing, the score (including the levels at which it played at the suitable times), the lack of CGI messing up scenes, a MUCH better Rachel Dawes, it goes on....quite a bit. But what would be the point of repeating such praise again and again in these IMDb user comments.The only things that I didn't dig so much, and this one goes for Begins as well, is that Gotham City doesn't look right. Pretty much the only thing Burton did right was gotham city (and I also liked the way he portrayed it's inhabitants), I do have a feeling that it was done as to not mirror the Burton films though. Also Two Face actually becoming fully bad could've been kept until the third movie too. It would've gone really well with the whole flow of the saga, because unlike ALL other (superhero) comic book film adaptions, the villains carry on and the films are linked by them. It's not just new villain who dies at the end, because thats not how the comics work. So yeah, he could've just crawled from the wreck after he shot the driver, and left the audience unsure of what exactly happened to him.I'll have to wait and see how it flows into the third installment though, it may end up working really well.I liked the way you expected the BatCave, but it wasn't there, which again adds to the flow of the saga....I like the fact that the 'batmobile' was destroyed, so hopefully there's a new design for three cos I really disliked this Batmobile even though it sounded awesome.I'll have to see it again to make up my mind on the, sonar phone watching centre. Not because of the plausibility of it, but more-so the morality. I need to see if Batman was pained by having to do that, because in my opinion, loss of civil rights/human rights is much much worse then death. The scene seemed to say that if it's necessary, it's necessary which is blergghh. They could've just had all the phones in Gotham being monitored, but just by audio, had a continuous track on the Jokers voice print (which are much more unique then fingerprints) and then for it to come up only when it was found, and then only on that call as to not destroy individuals privacy.Even with all the negatives I mentioned it still deserves a 9.5 . God I wish you could give half points, I want to give many things half points.....10 perhaps if it wasn't for the phone issue, but yeah. Great film.9/10(Reviewed after first viewing)",

    "reviewTitle": "Not perfect but darned entertaining",
    "reviewBody": "So this movie has been mega-hyped and I did see it on opening day. I enjoyed it, though I'm not sure I'd sit through it again. First, the positive points. There is nice eye-candy for the female movie-goer in Bale and Eckhart. The performances all around are stellar. Obviously, Ledger's Joker is amazing. I personally found it to be one of the best performances I've seen in an actor (this may be ironic but I found it as chilling as Nicholson's role in The Shining). He was superb and I found myself waiting for the scenes in which he would reappear. I also though Gary Oldman did some very nice work. His performance was restrained in the right places and emotionally wrought in others. Eckhart and Caine were really terrific in their roles as well. Freeman played the same character he always does and that was fine. Maggie Gyllenhaal was unwatchable. Horrible acting on a horribly written character. And I don't mean to be rude, but she is way too homely looking for the viewer to believe uber-hotties would be lusting after her. She was terrible.The negatives: The movie is way too long. I found it uncomfortably long. Bale's Batman voice grated on my nerves. I appreciate the intensity and artistic style of this movie, but it just wasn't a whole lot of fun. It was dark, heavy, brooding, and a bit depressing. Recommended but not loved.",

    "reviewTitle": "Entertaining, but NOT a masterpiece. Uh-uh. Not by a longshot.",
    "reviewBody": "Wow. Can't believe how high the rating is for this film on IMDb. Did we all see the SAME film?? Wow.Okay, just got back from seeing this, and I gotta say, I was very, very disappointed. Overall, the movie had its moments, but maaaan oh maaaan, was this movie WAY TOO LONG. And unnecessarily so. So far, Christian Bale has proved to be a satisfying Batman, but NO ONE has lived up to my vision of what Batman should truly be up on the big screen. That said, let's move on.THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE: The WORSE PART about this movie for me was the editing. It was unforgivably choppy. Too many scenes ended too abruptly and I guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of \"GAPING PLOT HOLES\". THE ACTION: Very intense from the beginning which was great, but the movie peetered out toward the end. That whole scene with Harvey Dent holding Gordon's family hostage was just way too long and too over the top. Dent's transformation into evil happened too quickly, which made his descent into \"Bat-Villain\" unconvincing. It was like he was having a very bad tantrum, that's all. He needed to be spanked or hugged. Nope. Despite what you may read, there wasn't ANYTHING poetic about it. Sorry, Freudians. COOLEST SCENES: I really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between Batman and The Joker. Great, great stuff. Batman was extremely close to \"losin' it\" and I thought for a second he just may kill him, he just might snap and do it. But nah. Batman isn't nearly as amoral as ol' Clown Face. Another scene I liked was when Batman was in Hong Kong kickin' some baddies asses, then he grabs the head honcho Asian dude(can't remember his name, sorry), launches some balloon thingy in the sky, hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane (which of course was all arranged...I wonder who was flying the thing? Lucius?) which takes off into the night sky. That scene was TIGHT. Executed brilliantly. MOST MEMORABLE SCENES: The Joker making that pencil \"disappear.\" The Joker walking away in a nurse's uniform as bombs go off behind him. Classic. Those images will stay with me for a long, long time.COOLEST TOY: The Batpod. Geeks will cheer.PERFORMANCES: Heath Ledger was good, yes. Did he give me chills and simply blow me away? Sadly, no. But perhaps I was expecting WAY TOO MUCH. After all, the buzz on his performance as The Joker started way back in January. Does he deserve a posthumous Oscar? No. An Oscar nomination should more than suffice for the \"kudos\" he's been getting. His death is what has swayed, or rather, \"manipulated\" people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen. Don't be so gullible. It's a good performance, don't get me wrong. But it's not history making. However, Heath now makes Nicholson's Joker look as campy and as ridiculous as Cesar Romero. Christian Bale had his moments; so did Aaron Eckhart. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine will always be veterans of their craft. Everyone else could have phoned it in.THE MUSIC: Not memorable. And in some scenes, shrill and annoying. Where or WHERE is Danny Elfman? WHAT BUGGED ME THE MOST: Batman's gravelly, and super LOUD voice. It sounded completely ridiculous and over-amplified. Not menacing. Just ridiculous. I thought the script tried too hard to send a message. What we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly \"preachy\".THE ENDING: A dud. Even though the movie was an agonizing 2.5 hours, I still felt something was missing. Batman being \"hunted down\" by Gordon and the GCPD was lame. The Nolan brothers should've written a much more satisfying ending. I felt cheated. There was not enough of a satisfying denouement for The Joker. He was just left hanging there upside down, giggling like a school girl on crack. They should've given The Joker a much more satisfying final scene. Like that last shot of Anthony Perkins in \"Psycho\", staring chillingly into the camera. Joker's exit should have been just as memorable and just as SCARY. What they gave us was WEAK. Pure and simple. And that really, really SUCKS since it was indeed Heath's final scene. His final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most. They could've given him a better tribute than that. WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN: The Joker being FUNNY. Come on, people! That's what The Joker has ALWAYS been about. Not campy, but funny. Heath's interpretation of The Joker was nothing like in the comics. I understand the Nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that, but let's get real and stick to story origins, okay? The Joker is a demented psychopath yes, but he's also supposed to be wickedly funny. You know, laughing at his own sick twisted humor. We got NONE OF THAT from Heath's portrayal. What he played was a character who should've been named The Sicko. Or The Money Burner. Or Chaos Man. In any case, the Nolan brothers, to me, failed to give us The Joker we all really wanted to see. Again, I liked Heath's performance. I did. But there was still so much missing. OVERALL REVIEW: I was entertained by this film, but was sadly disappointed with the pacing, the editing and some of the gaping plot holes. And what sucks is that I'm a HUGE Batman fan. HUGE!!! I SOOOO wanted this film to be a masterpiece, but it wasn't. Not by a longshot.I actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars, but most of you made this movie's rating on IMDb just unforgivably TOO HIGH.",

    "reviewBody": "One of the best films of the year. In 2005, I walked out of Batman Begins with a huge smile on my face! I could not wait for this sequel.Batman Begins was everything I wanted in a Batman film, it had tons of action, superb acting and direction, nifty camera work, and a story to tell. It was the Batman film I have been waiting for. Now this is probably one of the best comic book superhero films of all time.As Kevin Smith said, it really is the Godfather Pt. II of comic book films. The acting is it's chief strength in this movie. Christian Bale is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne of all time, thank god Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes, and Heath Ledger god rest his soul. Ledger was the perfect Joker, even better than the great Jack Nicholson. Ledger's performance is so terrifying, and he brings depth, realism, and fear to his Joker. I really hope they give him an award. The film has a great supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as DA Harvey Dent, who becomes Two-Face, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordan, Michael Cain as Bruce's trustworthy butler, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Christopher Nolan again will blow you away with this one, as he did in Batman Begins. The action scenes rock, and they don't look fake at all the stunts are amazing.The Dark Knight tops The Incredible Hulk and in a few ways tops Iron Man. I would say this is right next to Spider-Man 2 one of my personal favorites. This film is completely flawless, and it is one of the best films of 2008, and a movie you must see! Just like Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original in almost every way possible! The story is so well written, and the script just keeps the film going and moving in a good pace, and I was never bored with the sub-plots, or even the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent, and Rachel Dawes.The run time is long, but I must tell all who read this review, that it is the fastest two-hour thirty-minute epic I have ever seen in a long time. Not a minute in this film I was thinking, oh they should have cut at least seven or eight minutes. This is an Oscar worthy film, I know the Acadmey will not give it any recognition, because they are just not fair. Like all those other superhero flicks that do deserve nominations besides special effects, like Batman Begins, Spider-Man 2, X2:X-Men United, this year's Iron Man, or many, many other comic book flicks that are Oscar worthy.In closing The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, and will not disappoint fans of Batman, and this is a comic book movie for non-comic book fans, and it'll leave a lot of fan boys wanting more. I know I did, and I hope the third chapter of the Nolan series will come out soon, and top this one.",

He stole this movie away from the powerhouse Christian Bale - who never shone brighter than he did in Batman Begins - and the tremendous understated Gary Oldman. Aaron Eckhardt is also a great talent and was a surprising treat as Harvey Dent. There was almost nothing wrong with this film.But I think it was too long. At least, I'm pretty sure it was.I honestly thought the show was over when the Joker was apprehended the first time and was very satisfied with that ending. But it was only half way finished.Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the 2nd half, either. It was good storytelling, deeply thoughtful psychodrama, and filled with amazing action. So, why not make two movies out of it? Then we could have savored the legacy of the late Heath Ledger that much more.",

    "reviewBody": "Before seeing the movie, I was ridiculously excited about it. I was hoping my expectations would be met... and in most respects, they were. It's a very enjoyable, well-done movie. But there are things I think need to be different in order for the movie to be perfect. Comparatively, Batman Begins feels like a more well thought out movie than The Dark Knight. It had a much more focused point to it. The story was more personal and felt more real, I guess you could say. The Dark Knight almost takes on too much. Action is awesome. The visuals are amazing. Acting is top-notch. The actual production value of this movie is something to be in awe of. The only problems it has are the fault of the script. I think maybe it should have gone through another draft or two. But, that being said, it's definitely a very good movie. Heath Ledger's performance is as great as we all knew it would be since the moment we first saw the trailers. *SPOILERS*My biggest beef with the movie is the fact that there wasn't a huge showdown between Batman and the Joker like it looked like there would be in the trailer. The first theatrical trailer ended with the Joker in the street saying \"Hit me!\", and then the big low angle shot of Batman sliding past him on the Bat-Pod. I thought this would be the climax. Batman and Joker were gonna have a huge epic showdown in the streets of Gotham. It didn't turn out this way. Those shots were actually part of a scene that comes about mid- way through the movie, and is actually over quite quickly after that. The climax that DOES happen between Batman and Joker is considerably smaller on the edge of a building, and there isn't really anything all that \"showdown\"-y about it. Perhaps they were saving the showdown for another movie... too bad they didn't know this was the only film they'd get with Ledger as the Joker. But that bit of disappointment is nothing more than just my misguided expectations, and I can't really blame the film for that. *END SPOILERS*So... all in all, I very much like the film. I don't quite love it like I thought I would... yet. Perhaps repeat viewing will get me more comfortable with the movie, and I'll love it. As of this moment, I'm still a little uncomfortable with it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best AcTion Movie in A loNg time! (look at caps)",
    "reviewBody": "Just saw the midnight release of The Dark Knight and I must say I was more excited to see this movie than any other movie I have ever seen in theaters. Expecting a masterpiece in a comic book movie is crazy, I know, but a masterpiece is exactly what I got.First off, let me just say that the acting was PHENOMENAL! Christian Bale delivers another solid performance as Batman, and we can now comfortably say that he is by far the best actor to ever play the role. At first I was upset Katie Holmes did not come back for this movie but Maggie Gyllenhall does a fine job as Rachel. Caine, Oldman, and Freeman all do a great job as role characters, as they did in the first but the best acting was by two of the new guys.Aaron Eckhart as Two Face makes Tommy Lee Jones a figment of our imagination as he blows his performance out of the water. But the real story of the night was Heath Ledger as The Joker. Sad to see him go, I am glad that he will be remembered not as a cowboy, but as The Joker. Every scene that he was in gave me the chills, as he perfectly portrayed the psychopathic ways of The Joker and really helped you understand why he does the things he does. If he does not win an Oscar for his performance it will be a major disappointment.Last on the list is the Director. Christopher Nolan(Batman Begins, The Prestige), yet again makes a brilliant movie. This movie though, is by far his best, and hopefully, he winds up with an Oscar for it. The only movie I know of that may compete is the new 007 movie, but I personally don't even think it will come close as this movie, like a said before, is truly a MASTERPIECE. Well worth the ridiculous $10 dollars I had to spend to see it and I recommend it to all audiences. 10 out of 10 stars!",

    "reviewTitle": "What an awesome film!!!!! Ledger is the man!!",
    "reviewBody": "First let me set the stage so you might better appreciate my perspective. I love movies. It's so easy for me to give 7's and 8's on movies. Mostly because I simply enjoy watching movies. But I very rarely give out 9's and have never given out a 10. This movie is a 10. I feel as if I need to downgrade past reviews as a result. lol I went into this movie with some doubts. First I am a HUGE Jack Nicholson fan and was hoping nobody would ruin what I felt was a great last impression of the Joker (played by Mr. Nicholson). I didn't have faith in Ledger's performance either. Can't say I'm a fan of his. Not that I don't dislike him either but most of the movies he made I never really paid much attention to. Could care less about his Brokeback performance and felt he was becoming just another star they wanted to cram down our throats.Dark Knight is AWESOME!! I completely loved Heath Ledger's performance. I felt he stole the show. He left no stone unturned. Makes the actor who played Scarecrow (from the first movie) look like a fool in my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film. The writing was brilliant. Writing was a 10!! The veteran actors were superb and added much to the film in their limited roles. I will see Dark Knight again. I will own a copy of this film. There is no doubt in my mind that Ledger's performance in this film would have shot him straight to the top of the charts, even higher than before. Thank you for your brilliant performance.",

Just wait for his 'magic trick' scene. A classic. I'm not gonna go through and say what everyone else has already said, but I will say this: POSSIBLE SPOILER: How about recasting Johnny Depp as the Joker in the next one? Him and Ledger look a lot alike, and there was only one other time (besides Ledger's performance) where I said 'this is some of the best acting i've ever seen', and that was Depp in the first Pirates of the Caribbean. I think he would do a great job, and I DON'T want to see the Joker disappear. He's far too entertaining.",

    "reviewTitle": "See this movie! But not the kids.",
    "reviewBody": "I am a skeptical critic who is rarely impressed by movies anymore. This was a happy exception.I went to see this movie with my brother, a film student, and by the end we were just both blown away. This is NOT a superhero movie. This is NOT a kids movie. This is NOT a happy-happy joy-joy wisecracking action flick with a smarmy, charming good guy and a hammed up over-the-top bad guy. This was a study of several incredible characters scraping against each other in a desperate quest of heavily flawed people trying to do the right thing.Now, there were a few 'comic book' moments. Like after the Batmobile gets blasted, and our hero 'ejects' into a motorcycle type pod from the blown-up car. That one almost lost me. Or when the Joker tells the sad tale of his demented dad, which turns out to be just a fantasy anyway because he tells a different origin story later. So that one kind of redeemed itself. And, I'm sorry... Ms. Gyllenhall... I don't find this woman attractive at all. Her face is like Droopy Dog met Kirsten Dunst. I know, it's harsh, but really, it did kinda ruin a little of the film for me. Her acting was perfectly fine. But she just isn't good looking at all. Aaron Eckhart, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and, of course, Heath Ledger were all PERFECT. The acting compliments this movie so well, you'll believe that these characters could be out on the streets. The story itself is more like a novel. It seems as if it struggles to find it's way for the first two acts, but by the end, everything fits together. It underscores a message of dark reality versus striving ideology in a world where corruption is rampant and a handful of dedicated people try to stop it. Amidst it all, is the Joker, the element of chaos ripping both systems apart.Now let's shoot the elephant in the room. Heath Ledger is dead. His performance was so incredible, so believable, and so darkly disturbing, that this movie is definitely NOT for kids. People think \"Oh, it's Batman, my kid will love it.\" Stop being an idiot. The movie is called \"THE DARK KNIGHT\" The Joker kills one person by slamming his head over a pencil and driving it into his brain. Getting back to the elephant... Yes, I believe Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar Nom for his performance. I'm not saying this because he's dead. I'm saying this because his performance was THAT good.The movie is like watching a novel, which is my favorite kind of movie. There are stories within stories adding a rich complexity. My favorite scene is when the hardened criminal throws the detonator out the window. You'll know it when you see it. I loved that.This is easily the best movie I've seen since Iron Man, and Iron Man was f-ing good! This movie made Batman Begins look shallow and empty. Not that Batman Begins was brilliant, but for a 'superhero' movie, it was good. The 'Dark Knight' is a good MOVIE period. See it. But leave the kids at home. This isn't 'biff! pow! thud!' Batman. This is dark, gritty, disturbing, gripping, enthralling and powerful. See. It.",

    "reviewTitle": "This movie can compete with any of the top 10 in the \"Top 250\"",
    "reviewBody": "Firstly.. Jesus Christ! I was not expecting that! This movie blew me away.Lets start basic natural attraction. This movie had realistic action that was still breath taking. Several scenes, including one with The Joker performing a Magic Trick, are spiced with Brutal violence that will leave you screaming \"OHH F@#%, YOU GOT OWNED\". The Fighting had the same type of realism as The Bourne Series. The Explosions, always jaw dropping. The Driving, Flat out riveting and nail biting. The Intensity of some sequences will leave you speech-less. The Acting, Oh My. What an incredible cast. Every performance was so believably real and just oozed with passion for the role. Every single actor and actress played their designated role flawlessly. Heath Ledger. . . In God's Honest Truth.. Deserves an Oscar for his role. I am not saying this because of him recently passing away, I'm saying this because he was sick, twisted, and deep in his eyes you could see.. He WAS The Joker. He was beyond amazing, not a soul on earth could have done a better job than him.Into the depths of this movie. This movie in general in a say on human's natural instinct. It is a insight into the human soul and the primal instincts of everyone. To put a specific scene into view here I'll refer to the Boat Scene.**SPOILERS**In this scene it is the joker stating to Batman that he can bring out the evil in the world. Joker was pulling the evil in people out into plain view. Shattering peoples appearance and their statements on their own morals. By putting their lives on the line. In Simpler view Joker put a gun to a mans head and said \"i will kill you unless you kill the man in the chair with a bag over his face.\" Trying to prove that once humans are rattled and frightened they will let loose there evil and break all rules giving into anarchy and madness, exactly what Joker was striving for. Also in this scene it not only tackles human nature, be two key modern stereotypes. 1: All Convicts are Terrible Murderer's. and the other stereotype 2: View of Convicts from modern citizens. And this scene examines these stereotypes in many ways. When the boats uproar in shouting and screaming, in the heat of the moment, people fighting for the detonator, everyone is ready to blow the other ship. Until people calm down and process the situation, asking themselves if they should take the other peoples lives. This is where the key insight is. That any human in the heat of a moment can make a mistake, but in the human mind all people who can stop and process things, are capable of good, thats is why no one pulled the pin. When not blocked by adrenaline the human mind works wonders and can accept any fate at the cost of what is right and good. People like the Joker cannot do this because they cannot slow down, or make a PLAN. He states that himself whilst talking to Two-Face in the hospital.Then when Joker see's neither ship explode it is hard for him to accept because he was so sure the people on the boat would act in haste and be quick to blow each other away. Though Good prevailed and he caught that glimpse of hope for Gotham and all of mankind, showing that Good and Right still existed in these unfair, dog-eat-dog, modern times.**END SPOILERS**Essentially that is why this movie is so good. Their are many other aspects to this movie as well that make it good, like the music, the filming, the script and much more.This movie is a Master-Piece in every sense.10/10 Dark Knight, You knocked me onto my A**.",

The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard works this time around, and is not just buzzing in the background like in the first one (By the way the Joker theme works really great on the screen) OK, the reason I did all of this, is because I needed to tell everyone, that this is the Batman movie you've been waiting for, the movie that goes to those dark places you knew these movies were destined to go, but actually never went. So go ahead and watch the movie already, stop reading my bad writing, and put a smile on your face...",

    "reviewBody": "Just like the joker, I am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society. Not that I'm immune myself, but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype... to watch humans horde into a frenzy of blissful ignorance.Let me make myself clear. Heath Ledger's performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this movie. He is stunning and he destroys JAck Nicholson's performance... and I say this knowing that I had previously thought, no one can do joker as good as Jack Nicholson.But Joker is only a third of this movie, and a shame in hindsight.The rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension, pace, plot and action.1. Christopher Nolan struggles with action scenes. They are confusing, chaotic, and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and cerebral experience. Somewhat boring.2. Batman is a lifeless and dull character. In 'batman begins' this was OK because he was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen, like a predator, but given a more open role, Batman in a cape was distracting. His metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film, but the conflicts he faces in this sequel pale in comparison. Batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions. Ready to reveal his identity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise... Dent must remain the white light.3. Two face is an oddball. An oddball of creation, of reaction and of evolution. His arch is a forced effort by Nolan. It doesn't make sense for him to kill Gordon's family. Dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous. He knew that there were bad people after him. Why the sudden transformation when this happened? The transformation of Two face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening.. That to believe in chance... is to believe in chaos... but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him... willing to kill a child. It doesn't make sense. Two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining.4. The pacing of this film is poor. There are moments where it is too fast, and moments where the film is too slow. Effectively, I think the movie should have ended sooner. It dragged out, and I was mostly non-responsive to the conclusion of two face.5. Ultimately for a movie to be amazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed. I didn't like the movie in its entirety. And I truly believe that had Heath Ledger not been involved in Dark Knight, the general consensus would have been a lot different, and the flaws a lot more glaringly obvious. This was a 2.5 hour movie in which everything but Joker was underwhelming.It was a good movie, but given the hype, its now everyone's favorite film of all time... as the IMDb ratings might soon suggest.",

    "reviewBody": "I just returned home from seeing the 12:01 AM showing of The Dark Knight. If any of you insomniacs are up at this hour, I want you to get in your car and drive to the nearest movie theater. Yes, at 4 AM. This film was an absolute masterpiece of a comic book superhero movie. A brilliant score, which, if I am not mistaken, ran throughout the duration of the movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that when Katie Holmes turned down her return in the Dark Knight, the casting directors had a chance to replace her with someone Christian Bale had more chemistry with, and they replaced her with Maggie Gyllenhaal (although a great actress, completely wrong for this role). In my opinion both actresses delivered unconvincing performances in their respective movies. But no matter. I give this movie 9 3/4 stars, due to trifles such as that. Nolan did a fantastic job conveying his intricate vision of this chapter in the life of this timeless antihero. I would like to commend him for his incredible work.Heath Ledger trumps Jack Nicholson as the Joker, delivering what was arguably his best performance ever. He without question went out with a bang. An absolute artist, the perverse nature of his masterpiece of a penultimate performance will force all to shudder at such an untimely death for such a talented man. A masterful performance, mind games, and plenty of big explosions await you. I think ten bucks is a shame.",

I thought it was too long, confusing, poor plot line, very very dark, a lot of gratuitous violence and Ledger's performance was just not Oscar material as so many are proclaiming. During the movie several people got up and left. There were a couple of times there my date and I thought about leaving but we paid premium bucks to see the thing and you hate wasting money like that.The film gets off to a pretty good start. We were all excited but as it went along it began to drag. Ledger looks awful and they relied enitrely on makeup (with no prosthetics they way they did with Nicholson) to give you the impression of a smiling joker. Here it was just white and red makeup piled on the way a six-year old might do after getting into mommy's makeup. And dark. Everything was so dark throughout the film that each time someone opened a flip phone it was as bright as a flashlight! (I thought, surely they aren't going to call anyone but because so many were doing it I figured they were looking at the time - a sure sign that the film was lumbering along.)From this viewer's perspective I thought it was awful.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight - Stylistic Entertainment for 2 1/2 Hours",
    "reviewBody": "In my opinion, \"The Dark Knight\" is probably the greatest movie that I've ever seen based on a comic book. Starting from a creative direction by Christopher Nolan, this film never loses its strength due to the strong performances from a group of exceptionally gifted actors of their time. Action sequences are well-shot (especially the beginning with the bank robbery scene), storyline is beautifully constructed, and dialogs are memorable.Let's step aside and take a look at the late Heath Ledger's performance. I was stunned by the time when the film was over; I felt that this role was destined for him to play. Prior to the viewing of this performance, I had this notion of seeing Ledger as a 'mediocre' actor with no training trying to seek stardom for himself. However, this performance as the Joker changed my whole perspective of him; it filled me with tremendous respect for him as a dedicated and talented actor of his generation. He lives and breathes like the Joker; his performance makes Jack Nicholson's performance seem so lame. He is totally unpredictable. His anarchic style of interpretation keeps the audience in suspense - whenever he is on screen, no one knows what he's going to do next. Ledger possesses this Brando-esquire unpredictability within him that makes his performance so interesting to watch. My favorite scene was the interrogation scene between the Joker and Batman. As Batman pounds on the Joker more and more, Joker's smile grows bigger; Ledger displays the danger and the violence that lies underneath the sinister character. Just watching Ledger's performance makes everything worthwhile. It will be inspiring to many of the aspiring actors out there (like me) and I wish he wins a posthumous Oscar for this role.Other performances were outstanding - Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhall, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts, Michael Caine, etc. Aaron Eckhart gives a tour-de-force performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, capturing the dynamic layers of emotions that the character is going through. However, Gary Oldman's performance in this film was one of the reason why I loved this film so much. Continuing from his touching performance in Batman Begins, Oldman uses his chance to convey the emotions and the development of the character through his subtle performance. Especially the scene with Harvey Dent near the end of the film, Oldman just lets everything out and just touches the hearts of every moviegoers out there. If Oldman receives an Oscar nomination for this, I wouldn't be surprised; because he truly deserves it. Period.Action scenes are very gripping to watch. Nolan takes you on this exciting and dangerous journey of following the intense cat-and-mouse game between Batman and the Joker. Bank robbery scene and the Dent abduction scene are fascinating to watch and it never lets your energy level down. Combining all the elements of the film (explained above), this film doesn't even feel like 2 1/2 hour film; just flow with the movie and you won't even know the time is passing by like a wind.I give this movie 9 out of 10 stars because I wasn't fully satisfied or extremely impressed with the film. Maybe it was because I went in with such a HIGH expectation due to the hype of the film. But, no matter what it is, this film will stand to be one of the finest movies to be made and I hope it will garner some Oscar nominations. Better yet, few Oscars.R.I.P. Heath Ledger (1979~2008)",

    "reviewBody": "To start, The Dark Knight definitely lived up to it's hype. Intense would be a word to describe the action in the movie, as well as suspenseful. With every weapon pulled out in the movie, someone dies, unlike most movies where the gun is just put down and the one it is pointed at stays alive. the action and dialogue scenes were equalized to keep the audience entertained as well as informed.Now, to start with the characters. Not much humor was passed in the movie, not including the Joker. He was the saviour of the movie. If there was no Joker, the movie may have gotten just over 6 stars on my rating. He kept the audience entertained with black humor comedy and most of the action/ killing scenes. Ledger did a better job than Nicholson in my opinion. As for Batman, Christian Bale did a great job of not attracting the movie's attention to himself. For most of the movie, everyone really just wanted to see the Joker. Two Face, the other villain, was just as exciting as Batman.This movie could have been better if each of the main characters was developed more and not just the Joker. That is why I gave the movie 9 out of 10 stars. The filming was great, the dialouge was great, and the action was great, but the characters weren't developed too well. Definitely see this movie as it will blow you away on the big screen.",

    "reviewTitle": "Like nothing you've seen from him before",
    "reviewBody": "I don't want to sound insensitive, but when people talk about how Heath Ledger's suicide may have been due to immersing himself too deeply into the role of the Joker, I think it may have been true.The Joker as portrayed in The Dark Knight is easily the most ruthless character I've ever seen. In one scene, Batman drives his Batpod straight for the Joker, while Joker simply stands in the middle of the street screaming for Batman to run him down. You can tell, as the movie unfolds, that it's not a deathwish that drives him; it's a chilling indifference to his own fate, as long as he can destroy the Batman's soul in the process.To say that he's prepared to die to accomplish his goal would imply that he felt death was something for which he needed to prepare; the Joker simply doesn't care whether he's alive or dead. He knows that if the Batman kills him that it would haunt Batman for the rest of his life, which would be worse than death.He repeats this in a scene with Harvey Dent, in which he hands him a gun to see if the heroic Harvey will murder him rather than try to bring him to justice. Recently scarred in an explosion, the newly emerged Two-Face tosses his signature coin to decide the Joker's fate; the Joker's only reaction to this is \"Now we're talking.\"Some people are offended by this; not that he's violent, but that he's wholly psychotic. They think of the over-the-top Cesar Romero Joker, or even the gangster-clown Jack Nicholson Joker, and say \"that's how it should be\". These people either haven't read the graphic novels detailing the Joker's reign of terror over Gotham City, or they have and just prefer that they have a \"funny villain\".That's not what the Joker is. The Joker is not a risk-taker or a thrill-seeker; he is nothing more or less than a complete psychopath. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime is absolutely my favorite interpretation. Every scene which features him leaves you wondering, \"Would I have closed my eyes if I knew that was coming?\", so vicious and yet so compelling they all are. Of course, they often happen too quickly for you to make that decision. If I want comedy, then I'll watch the animated series and catch Mark Hamill's act.In short, it's like nothing from either the Joker or Heath Ledger that you've ever seen before.",

Also, the bike.... ugh, the bike.... a bit cheesy for my taste, but maybe that's just me.All in all though, it was extremely well done and look forward to the next one being even better, if that's even possible.",

Since the beginning to the bitter end, i enjoyed each moment.....it was totally stunning. But I must say; the true heart of the film is Heath Ledger.....His acting will be remembered by decades to come. He brought the clown to life as no one else could do it.....I'm really sorry that he won't be here anymore; he was really a highly talented actor. But anyway, This film has become in one of my favorites of all time, full of surprises and twists, All this thanks to Christopher Nolan. I Just can say !Watch it¡ and !Enjoy it¡......One of the masterpieces of the new millennium......Hands down.",

    "reviewTitle": "One of the Best Movies...Ever.",
    "reviewBody": "Wow. I'm still speechless.*Minor Spoilers* I don't think I've seen a movie as good as this since Godfather 2. It was amazing. It surpassed my expectations and than some. The direction is flawless and amazing. I really can't put it into words how great it is, you have to go see it for yourself, the cinematography was probably the best I've seen. I know I'm sounding like a fanboy right now but its the truth.Heath Ledger is beyond words. He is the best villain I have ever witnessed on screen, yes better than Darth Vader. His self regard for human life makes him the perfect nemesis for Batman. I've lost count at how many people he killed in this film. He got into Batman/Bruce's mind and messed with him emotionally. He was psychotic and was funny even when he wasn't supposed to. Its a shame that he won't be able to watch his performance on the screen, R.I.P. Right now if he isn't voted for Best Supporting Actor it would be a real shame. You'll will understand once you see this movie. He made him so realistic and scary. I wouldn't bring a kid under 6 to this movie.Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman were all terrific as well but were just out shined by Heath Ledger. Christian does a much better job this time around as Bruce Wayne and Batman. I had my doubts of Aaron at first but he delivered and Oldman is the perfect Jim Gordon.The action sequences took a huge leap from the first film and there are tons of them. The music from BB returns and is still as solid as ever. Nolan has really created a masterpiece here and with his little use of CGI makes it even more impressive.I'm still in awe while typing this and its still not as long as I wanted it to be. I'm going to try to go back tomorrow or Saturday and watch it again. If you don't even like Batman or comics you will like this movie and it better be the first \"Superhero\" movie to be nominated for Best Picture, along with Best Cinematography, Best Supporting Actor and Best Director. This movie will be in talks when you mention best movies like Godfather, Godfather 2, ESB, The Shawshank Redemption, Schlinders List etc etc. I recommend it to anyone.Rating: 9.8/10",

    "reviewBody": "This is not an inspirational superhero film. This is a nice, gritty, dark story. Good people die unfairly, and others struggle with their losses. The intensity is well dramatized by the actors and the supporting sounds.The psychopath is scary in the worst way...in a legitimate way. Psychopaths never stop gaming, it's all they know, and it's usually about bringing their normal targets, outwardly good people, down to their lowest level. The storytellers fully recognize those facts. The intellectual twists, games and suspense remind me of the Jason Bourne films. Yeah, that good.You will sense the point when you think a normal film would have ended, but there is still more to come...another dark story to finish.You will not leave the theater feeling inspired, because there is no happy ending. But you will likely recognize and appreciate the legitimacy of this dark tale. Mr. Nolan and company will find it extremely difficult to match the quality of this story in the future.We should all relish in it while we can.",

    "reviewTitle": "Believe the hype!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "reviewBody": "I don't even know where to begin with this movie. I have never been more excited to see a movie more than Iwas excited to see The Dark Knight. As soon as I saw Memento, I knew that Christopher Nolan was what all directors in Hollywood should aspire to. Batman Begins was incredible and who could forget the intricacies of The Prestige. Christopher Nolan, Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro and Ridley Scott are the class of Hollywood right now. Now for The Dark KnightI was absolutely ecstatic when I heard Heath Ledger was going to portray The Joker. Heath's death was tragic in every way possible. We lost a true talent who would have captured the big screen for many many years to come. Early marketing was all hype for Ledger's Joker performance and rightly so. In all of the comic book world there is no more important hero/villain relationship than Batman/Joker. It's better than Superman/Lex Luthor, better than X-Men/Magneto, better than Fantastic 4/Dr. Doom, better than Spider-Man/Venom. You DO NOT have Batman without the Joker. With all the hype leading up to Ledger's Joker the question is raised: is it worth the hype? The answer, in a word is ABSOLUTELY. Jack Nicholson has nothing on Heath Ledger. The Joker steals the screen in every scene he is in. He also has the greatest entrance of any character possibly ever with his \"disappearing pencil trick.\" It sets the tone for his character as dark, twisted, demented, sadistic and strangely funny. It is a OMG scene but you will have a very hard time not laughing. Ledger steals the movie, but in a very good way. He is over-the-top but you never ask him to apologize for it, in fact, you'll be thanking him for it. The Joker sums it up in one line when he says to Batman \"you and I could do this forever.\" If the Acadamy does not recognize Heath Ledger posthumously for his role in The Dark Knight, then I vow to never watch the Oscars ever again.Now for Christian Bale. After watching the '89 and 90's Batmans I always thought that if you could take Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne character and mix it with Val Kilmer's Batman character that you'd have the perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Christian Bale. He is the fun loving and smart Bruce Wayne that Micheal Keaton gave us and the brooding and unrelenting Batman that Val Kilmer gave us. Batman has always been my favorite hero because he has no superhuman powers. He is a vigilante but never crosses the dark line. However, at the same time he is angry with how his beloved Gotham City has been taken over by crime. I have always liked Christian Bale. In The Dark Knight we see Batman struggling with how the morals and ethics of being a hero, but not crossing the moral line and becoming a criminal himself. Much like in Batman Forever we see Bruce Wayne considering hanging up the mask forever. Batman goes from being the Caped Crusader to the title character of The Dark Knight. Bale pulls this role off flawlessly and you really start to feel for his struggle with donning the mask and cape.Michael Caine is always brilliant, and he gives the role of Alfred Pennyworth his due course and adds in some humility, direction and even a little humor. I am glad Nolan gave him this role.Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is awesome. This was another casting that I was very excited for. Dent's character is perfect. If Batman is the Dark Knight, then Dent is Gotham's White Knight so to speak. Dent ruthlessly hunts down, in the legal realm, Gotham's criminals in an effort to clean the streets of crime and corruption. However, as we all know, Harvey Dent must eventually become Two-Face and you see his struggle with morality. Dent himself has a dark side that he must confront on several occasions. SPOILER HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dent does become Two-Face about 3/4ths of the way through the movie. It is not the cartoon-like Two-Face that Tommy Lee Jones gives us. Like the rest of the movie, it is dark and evil and when you see his face you might look away at first. It's not for the feint of heart. END SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfectly re-cast as Rachel Dawes. She seems to connect better with Bale than Holmes did. However, Nolan does not give her character much to do in the movie. She does have a cool encounter with The Joker, but overall her character is not extremely important to the movie as a whole.Gary Oldman is another character that deserves an award for his role in The Dark Knight. His portrayal of Jim Gordon is awesome. For moments in the movie you actually forget that he's acting. He must find his own place in a corrupt police force that struggles with deciding to capture or honor Batman. Nolan hit the nail on the head again with this casting choice.Overall, the story is a little convoluted, but it doesn't matter because once the Joker hits the scene, that's all you care about. The fights between Batman and Joker are epic. This is the blueprint of how all comic book/superhero movies must be made. Iron Man was cool, but I left this movie thinking to myself, \"who's Iron Man?\" This movie lives up to every hype possible and is required viewing for everyone and anyone who likes movies at all. This is one of the few movies I've seen that I cannot point out any flaws in the film-making.A resounding 10/10Heath Ledger 1979-2008 RIP",

    "reviewTitle": "WOW! go see this right now!",
    "reviewBody": "This movie is truly excellent and i was also extremely hyped for this film and expected it to be great. But it even surpassed those expectations and delivered on all accounts. First of all everything that people said about heath ledger deserving an Oscar for his portrayal of the joker is completely solid. He really is amazing he has this charisma about him and he'll make you laugh when he's blowing up a hospital literally. His character is so deep and evil you'll forget your watching a batman movie. Secondly, everything else, i don't mean to sound lazy but honestly if i said all thats good about this film i'd be typing for hours. Each performance is great if not excellent, the writing is perfect and touches on issues you'd never expect in a superhero film, great action sequences and even has some small bits of comedy to lighten up this otherwise dark film and i mean that in a good way. If there is one thing i could nitpick it would be that the scarecrow was wasted and unnecessary in this installment. He was a huge threat to batman in the last film but in this one he is taken down like an ordinary thug. But this is only a small gripe and most won't care anyway, just go and see it, NOW!!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Mindblowing. In an almost frustrating kind of way.",
    "reviewBody": "\"He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.\" Friedrich Nietzche.Perhaps it was the midnight opening's fault. I was very tired. I knew something spectacular, awe-inspiring, and vast was passing in front of my eyes, but it was all so very fast. It was like passing a beautiful landscape in a minute. A two-and-a-half-hour-long minute. I felt aggravated that Christopher Nolan had not given his public more time for the (no doubt) wonderful movie to sink in. I felt genuinely angry.Dare I say disappointed? But this morning, getting up for work, the wretched movie would not get off my mind. Everything came back in pieces, Gordon's teary-eyed pleas, Lucius' righteous resignation, Alfred's military past, Rachel's goodbye, Dent's near-unshatterable idealism and the Joker's manic genius, twitchy words, his unbelievable coherence and the fact I found I could quote almost everything he had said, notwithstanding the fact that it was impossible to understand the first time through. And Batman was everything. He was the glue attempting to hold a crumbling world together.And suddenly another annoyingly memorable Nolan film came to mind: Memento. I thought the movie to be completely unbearable at first. Now, after over 20 views, I daresay it is my absolute favourite.The Dark Knight is of the same substance: a torturing, hard-to-digest plot, which serves to distracts you from Nolan's point. The plot is amazing, but focus on it too hard, and you will miss the golden thread beneath the surface, the soul of his story: the strife within his characters, the strife within society, within existence. The anguish of believing in the ultimate goodness of man in a city as rotten as Gotham, goodness taught through an example killed in an alley so long ago, anchors the very motivation of Batman, the source of all his strength and his greatest weakness. The faith in a condemned humankind as opposed to himself alone, is the Batman's ultimate paradox. A paradox that is clenched, twisted, and crushed by the prodigious Joker, gradually destroying all that Bruce Wayne cares for in the world, leaving him with nothing but his pain, his solitude, and his excruciating hope.The Joker, devastatingly, makes more sense and coherence than all of Gotham's desperate society and leaders put together. With every brush of genius he paints the gruesome portrait that shows the world: \"Your system is broken. Your rules are farce. Nothing can come from your mediocre selfishness, your inescapably flawed human nature.\" It seems strange, but someone said that before. It was Bruce, the day he set out to achieve the vengeance that would have quelled the storm inside him. The day the Batman might have never been.",

    "reviewTitle": "Deep, Dark, Compelling, The Dark Knight transcends a genre.",
    "reviewBody": "so yes i had a ticket to last night's midnight showing of christopher nolan's second installment in his batman franchise, with Christian bale playing the caped crusader for this second go round. I don't have to tell you how much i had been anticipating this movie and from when the lights dimmed and then when they came back on, my head was spinning.The storyline isn't quite so linear, while still keeping a chain of events it kind of hops around a bit, it can be distracting a bit to a viewer who isn't familiar with nolan's camera work and storytelling, but this one's quite good, while we have characters who teeter on that line of black and white, we have others who completely cross over and end up smudging the lines until there is only grey. The story is captivating, intriguing, and keeps you guessing, it was certainly worth the 3 year wait.The acting well i think it can and will be said that Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of legendary, really and it's not his transformation though impressive, it's how he completely engulf's the character, he isn't some actor playing a part he is the joker, he eat, sleeps, and breathes madness and anarchy, a truly truly brilliant and very scary performance. Driven by the mantra of just wanting to \"watch the world burn\" his acts don't have reason, they are just to cause panic. Heath Ledger weather he died or not needs to be nominated for a best actor or best supporting actor award at next years Oscars, it's that important, it's that good. What a way to go out, and what a performance, on the other side there's newcomer aaron eckhart who gave a pretty notable and strong performance as D.A. Harvey Dent, really, and then does a nice job of his transformation into two face, a very notworthy performance. Christian Bale gave his always well acted performance but was obviously overshadowed by ledger and eckhart which i guess was to be expected, batman nor bruce wayne are very loud, obvious, or emotionally vibrant characters, so it's easy to see why his performance wasn't the strongest. All of the supporting players, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhall, and Eric Roberts all gave expected performances, nothing out of the ordinary and as always Gary Oldman shines once again in a very well done character acting role as Comissioner Jim Gordon.The direction of the film was so paramount to it's feel and how good it really was, Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of our time and really shows it in this one, weather it's the opening bank robbery scene or showing batman gliding over hong kong, he really knows no ends to camera angles and getting the most out of his actors.Overall the movie is honestly without being biased one of the best movies i've ever seen, it engrosses the viewer into a world not all that different from ours, a world with a single sliver of hope, and batman is that hope. It's so important the message of staying the course no matter the cost, the integrity of batman/bruce wayne through people dying, nearly wavers, and nearly crosses that line. The Joker/Batman showdown is honestly a really great battle of the psycology of both characters, this is most likely the most complex theme and element of this movie and both characters pull it off so well. I can't express my own personal satisfaction of how this movie turned out, it's not only a great superhero film, it's just a great film. It transcends genre's and is just a very well done film, great acting, directing, storyline that is engrossing, some funny dialouge with the joker, and yes he's funny in a sick silly way, As a whole this movie is as good as it could possibly hope to be. A well done film and a film that deserves all the accolades it has received and is yet to receive.10/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight. I couldn't avoid some spoilers, but minor ones.",
    "reviewBody": "I went to the screening of The Dark Knight yesterday. Expectations: really, REALLY high. When i came out of the cinema i wasn't as stunned as i thought i was going to be. The movie is great, no doubt of it but it was so overrated i cant even explain it. Lets divide it into 3. Start, main action and end. The start is slooow, but its fun. First Joker appearances are at least, funny. Ill try not to spoil anything but his jokes are Bizarre, you cant help laughing sometimes. It seems that it is going to be a nice movie but... nothing happens. In some moment i couldn't detect movie turns from a slow-paced one to an incredible action movie. Now this was what i was expecting for... but the end is not as strong... i needed something more. OK i wont spoil it.Heath Ledger as the Joker was extremely good, but its not greatest villain ever as i read everywhere!!! hes not scary at all... he is just mad, hes not even evil. Just one really madman.Christian Bale as Batman is not that good. When he is bruce wayne its all fine but when he switches to his batman voice is extremely annoying. Get the potato out of his mouth PLEASE!!!!Harvey dent character is nice... Aaron does a good job but Two Face is awful. What the **** is Terminator doing here¿¿?? and hes not even bad! he just wants revenge, doesn't seem bad to me. The rest of the cast is fine... Saying that this is greatest performance of Gary Oldman, Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman is just to insult their brilliant career. They have only a few lines in the movie.The OST is nice, but sometimes it is extremely epic for what we are watching on the screen. For example, harvey dent in his office with one Gladiator epic theme is too much.Scarecrow seems so weak that i think the fat batman could arrest him. I think this movie tries to be so real, and thats the main problem. Everything is real until terminator appearance. Its too weird. And wasted the rest of the movie.Final Words: Nice movie... not flawless, good joker bad two face. Good cast, bad batman. Its definitely not the greatest movie ever but its worth to see it. Sorry for my bad English :P.",

Batman Begins grabbed my attention much because of my love for Christian Bale's acting. Together, Bale and Nolan have resurrected a dead franchise.I am surprised this movie earned a PG-13 rating. This movie was so dark and tragic, I would've guessed R-rating. I have no quarrels with the movie's darkness and am even more impressed this movie WASN'T designed with children in mind.This movie will take you for a ride on an emotional roller coaster. After Rachel's death, I nearly cried for Harvey and his sadness. It was overwhelming. As for the next movie, I would've liked to see Nolan save two-face for the finale. He entered two-face in this movie to give the sorrow and sadness factor. I can't think of any villain who could be better than two-face and especially Joker were in this movie.

    "reviewTitle": "Great Flick with minor faults....",
    "reviewBody": "Working at Blockbuster Video it takes a lot for me to go to the theatre to see films. I went to an early midnight showing and was not disappointed in the least. This movie has an all-star cast and Bale once again performs both Bruce Wayne and Batman to the fullest. Hedger is scary good and of course Freeman is always great as the technological mastermind behind all of Batman's gadgets. The plot is great and the fighting is awesome. For me however, there were a few minor faults...1) Scarecrow was suddenly a fighter of good? And his henchman came complete with \"batman\" attire? So you're trying to convince me that a villain like the scarecrow, who lived to bring people into a state of insanity is good? and without any explanation??? 2) Batman was more punch and less thought. Now I understand it was written this way, but let's be serious. Batman has to choose between Rachel or Harvey Dent...naturally Bruce chooses Rachel. But Batman would have and should have known this was a trick, it is the Joker for crying out loud. I mean he knew that the \"Jokers\" in the warehouse were the hostages tied up, taped up, and masked, but he couldn't see that Joker told Batman where the opposite was?? I don't buy it, sorry.3) And this is perhaps just old school preference here but...The cape looked way to un-batman. First off the masked just looked way too tight. Secondly, I like the idea of the cape, but I want it ALL the time. It's cool that is expands or whatever during fall, but I want a blowing-in-the-wind \"BAT\" cape.Overall, was the movie worth a midnight showing, and is it worth going to in two days with my buddy from work, yes and yes. But was it as good as Batman Begins...I don't think so.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Decent movie. Don't believe the hype",
    "reviewBody": "First of all I want to this movie has its good points. The Opening scene starts off very strong. But then this ends up being one of the most impact-full scenes featuring the joker. Throughout this movie I was waiting for that scene. A great dialogue scene between The Joker and Gordon. Or even one between Batman and Two-Face. But Most of the bad-guys didn't have enough dialogue to make them more than a 2-d thug.I was also waiting for the film to build into a climax. Kind of like the first but it never happened. Both of the face off-s that batman had with both bad guys went no where. I kept drawing back to the Tim Burton movie, or as far as two face the cartoon, and remembering the great jobs they did with them. At the end of the original batman of course Jack Nicholson isn't going to put up a fight with batman. But his henchmen gave him problems, and when they didn't he would threaten batman's girl with acid. The end of this movie fizzles. They took a great premise with the ferry's, and at the expense of trying to make the movie realistic they made it very un-suspenseful.Two other things that bugged me throughout were that editing and shooting around the action scenes. I never would get a sense of the whole scene or what was going on. The editing was really fast and from close shot to close shot. No long shots what so ever so we couldn't get a true sense of where the character where in relation to one another - AKA the underground car chase scene. Also Christian Bale's voice in the bat suit bugged me. But these are minor things compared to anti-climactic ending of the movie.In conclusion this movie started big but didn't live up to the hype. And when I say the word HYPE I'm not referring to Heath Ledger. I'm referring to HYPE about the JOKER! One of the best bad guys ever created. It just seemed like they were caught between being scary and funny with the Joker which is a good place to be. But in that struggle I never felt scared for a second. Where as in past Batman stories I was truly scared that his schemes would work.",

Definitely intense suspenseful, and very depressing, from the whole death of Maggie, us thinking that Gordon ( Gary Oldman) died and then a shock of his coming back to life the hole audience clapped and cheered!!! But the one thing that really made the movie depressing to me, of course, Heath. Ever since I was young he had become such a favorite actor of mine, his gentleness, how shy he was!! delicate, i don't understand why god took away a person like that. And its so hard for me as much as I just dying to talk of how his performance in the joker was the best performance of a male actor I've seen in many years, that makeup he did himself, that voice, laugh, and oh my god!!!! The pencil trick!!!!!!!! What is now from what we have seen, this is undeniably the turning point in his career! Oscar worthy, Hell yes!!!! And from all of this, hes gone. Its a shame. I would like to think of it as his body is gone , but his performances will live on forever and from what what I've seen from his masterful performance in the dark night, AFI has a new actor to add to their lists!!! Well besides that misfortune I think we had a wonderful cast with performances that moved me and heath, leaving me breathless! Its rare a movie have flawlessness especially a sequel. But this was so much more, than anything I've seen, Im honored to have gone to the premiere, honored to have seen this flawless movie, and honored to see Heaths flawless performance for the last time! rest in piece Heath Ledger, You wont be forgotten from me! 4/4/79 - 1/22/08",

    "reviewBody": "No other superhero movie have i seen is better than this...i came out of theaters scoffing at the Hancock posters. The Dark Knight surpassed all hopes i had for this movie. At first i was questioning if it would be better than Batman Begins. It outdid it in every aspect. Christian Bale is the best batman anyone could ever ask for. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a better choice for the role of Rachel Dawes. I personally am not a big Katie Holms fan. Though she did very well in Batman Begins i feel Gyllenhaal was a better selection for the role. Aaron Eckhart was everything you could ask for in Harvey Dent(surpassed Billy Dee William's role as dent in the '89 film) And the transformation between Dent to Two-Face began very subtle and maxed out as best it could. I feel it was done very well with the gasoline spilling on his left half of his face and it just catching a spark. He played Two-Face very well way better than Tommy Lee Jones in the old Batman movies that many people will now forget. Eckhart did very well in this role.Heath Ledger...he stole the show! It was going to be tough to replace Jack Nicholson as the Joker in our hearts. Ledger was the best selection for this character. He was so devoted to almost create his own back story for the character. He went back and forth from extreme to extreme to complete this role. Anyone who can watch A Clockwork Orange(1971) daily just to watch Alex to get into character has got to be nuts. And to look to Sid Vicious(who killed his wife or girlfriend) for inspiration. This helped him pull off \"nuts\" better than anyone else could even try to do. His depiction and so chosen persona of the Joker was right on. Ledger did great work on his last full production movie before his tragic death. All in all the best movie of 2008 and best superhero movie ever!",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Sequel I've Ever Seen",
    "reviewBody": "Just so you know, I do tend to like most sequels except ones like The Butterfly Effect 2 and Phenomenon 2 which was just a retelling of the first movie usually with no characters from the first one in it. Also a sequel like Blues Brothers 2000 was crap. Magic? Honostly. Wow, I'm nearly a full paragraph into my review and I haven't said anything about the Dark Knight except that it's a sequel. Well there is one thing you should know about this movie. It Freaking Rocks I'm a huge fan of comics but I mostly stay in the Marvel category because DC always seemed to outdated. Superman and Batman (the original movies) came out some 20-30 years ago and never seemed quite realistic. Studios have tried to bring these famous superheroes into the 21st century with Superman return, which was supposed to be the third in the Christopher Reeves series even thought their was little or no continuity and I had thought that Batman Begins was supposed to have been a prequel to the old Timothy Burton series (though now I've read the IMDb FAQ I now know that it wasn't which was good because I could've told you that if it was then it failed considering the original movie had it that the Joker killed Bruce's parents... I think... my memory's getting away from me... It might've been Two-Face...) And speaking of the Joker and Two-Face, that brings me to the two main villains of this film. Heath Ledger and Whatshisname (Aaron Eckhart? I'd check but that would take precious seconds away from me ranting about my new favourite movie) were ABSOLUTELY FATASTIC. I'll explain by starting with the Joker. First of all, I was a huge fan of Jack Nicklson's (I spelt that wrong) performance of the Joker in Tim Burton's classic. He was absolutely perfect choice for the Joker. But I'm going to have to say that Heath Ledger's performance completely surpasses Nicklson's. Wow. The voice that Ledger has created for his villain made my skin crawl. The way that he could make every lip smack so perfectly audible was creepy. Also, the voice was obviously the voice of a lunatic and when he was angry and shouted it made me jump ie. the video when he shouted \"LOOK AT ME!\" and also when he said \"Why... so... Serious?\". But we must remember that Ledger didn't actually come up with the dialog himself and a round of applause should go to Christopher Nolan and his brother for writing the part so well. Don't get me wrong, the first time that he explained how he got his scars my heart sank as I felt they had destroyed the mystery that had made the Joker so creepy. But when he explained how he got his scars the second and the story was completely different I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie hoping to hear a brand new story about his scars (sadly though it never came). Now comes the second villain. I'm glad the the Nolan brothers knew that people would already know that Harvey Dent would become Two-Face and gave us little nods with things like the coin flipping and the line \"You live long enough to see yourself become the villain\". The only thing that upset me is that he had to die, because he had obviously become a madman. I can't say that the performance was as legendary as the Ledger's back was fantastic nonetheless. The funny thing is that the performances of the two bad guys completely overshadow the main character Bruce Wayne/Batman. That isn't to say that Chritain Bale's performance was bad it's just that we sometimes forget that the movie is about Batman and not Commissioner Gordon, who seems to be the main good guy considering that at the end of the movie... wait, you know what. Even though I've said that there are spoilers in this review, I'm not going to give away the ending that makes this movie so much better than all other superhero movies. Watch it again if you've already seen it. Best Movie Ever. 10/10",

    "reviewBody": "I tried to see the midnight show at a nearby theater. It was sold out on all 5 screens at the theater I went to, 30 minutes early. I saw it the next day. The Joker was awesome as I expected him to be, after watching the trailers and reading the reviews. The real surprise for me was how excellent Two Face was in the movie; I hadn't seen his disfigured face prior to the movie, and he looked AWESOME! Straight out of the comic books, and his transformation from Harvey Dent's white knight to murderous monster was chilling. And believable; you can see his evolution throughout the film. The incident that pushed him over the edge would have challenged any of us to stay on the straight and narrow. Much better than Anakin Skywalker's turning to the Dark Side in Revenge of the Sith. I recommend seeing this movie whether you're a Bat Fan or not.",

    "reviewTitle": "This movie will live on forever...",
    "reviewBody": "wow. just...wow. this movie is so amazing. words cannot describe it. well...i guess i can try my best. so where do we begin. I'm going to start off with the man who is the star of the picture: Christian bale. this man gave so much depth to both Bruce Wayne and batman. you can see the emotions in his eyes and you can also just feel this characters pain. its just madness. bale is and always will be the best batman. now Maggie Gyllenhaal. she gave so much more to Rachel than stone faced Katie Holmes. Maggie made Rachel a tough woman who is not a damsel in distress. Rachel in this movie is someone who can take care of herself and is not afraid. when you see her showing emotion you see emotion. you see a real character. its because of Maggie that i actually like the character of Rachel Dawes now. Gary Oldman. a versatile actor like him needs no words except that he embodied a wholesome character (alright this is in the words of Chris Nolan but the guy is sooooo right). now Aaron Eckhart. Harvey dent/two-face is my second favorite villain of all time and this man got him down. Harvey dent is an American hero and a person who has anger issues *wink**wink* and someone like Aaron was perfect you see someone with this battle of when to cross a line. this Harvey/two-face is the one that not only me but everyone has been waiting for. and last but not least...heath ledger. what can i say. this man got him down. joker is like a pack of playing cards you don't know what he is going to do next. even his voice is like a pack of playing cards being thrown at you there's so much to it. i mean i found myself laughing a few times. who knew black humor can be so funny? heath embodied this character. everything was vintage joker. you cant see heath one bit. its like someone caught a real life joker on camera. Chris Nolan is god. what Bruce Wayne said in batman begins is right. batman is incorruptible, he cant be destroyed. he is the dark knight. the character of batman and this movie of him will live on forever. batman is a savior. batman is a guardian. batman is a legend. and he will live on forever.",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark Knight Review",
    "reviewBody": "I have one problem with this movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She has no conviction, she is annoying, and I felt no sorrow when she died. Her failure to portray Rachel the way Katie Holmes made her in Batman Begins as wholesome and dedicated makes it hard to relate to Harvey Dent's grief. In this movie she is entirely different, seemingly only there because the plot requires it, she brings nothing to the movie. With that being said, that is one very little flaw in a fantastic movie. The sonar cell phone was a little strange, but I'll take it. I mean, Batman always has cool toys.What really makes this movie great is the way it can make you feel twisted. Ledger as the Joker is marvelous. He says that he has no plans, money is meaningless, it's all about the message. He's trying to send the message that we are all a little corrupt, we're all a little off, and we just need to be pushed. The human mind is a fragile thing. As dark as this movie is you are frequently laughing. The Joker takes a man's life with a joke, the disappearing pencil, sick and disgusting, yet everyone is laughing. Every scene with Ledger leaves you laughing and feeling as if you are the most terribly gruesome person. Why are you laughing, he's murdering people. We are corrupt. That is what he believes, and that's what he shows you. It's sick.Aside from the violence and mind twist you have the struggling hero. Or heroes. Batman fighting crime along side Harvey Dent. In the end Dent is corrupted, Batman is not. Batman is the hero that Gotham needs him to be. The greatness of this movie has little to do with Batman, but what he stands for against a world of corruption. He stands as the man who is willing to be loved or hated to see his city fight back. I will say no more, you must see this movie.It is likely that I will never love another movie more.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nolan creates brilliant multi-colored film and yet it all seems so familiar...",
    "reviewBody": "Well, I must say that the imagery in this movie is fantastic. I love the directing. Very symbolic. The acting is truly brilliant. Heath Ledger is most definitely a fine actor and very impressive. However, this movie was not so outstanding and I was not awe-stricken. The plots were very repetitive. It was as if I had seen it all before. Granted, the joker was extremely malevolent but that scene where he tells Batman that the city will turn on him and they will not love him anymore--all I could see was that scene from Spider-Man. Goblin speaks almost the exact same words. The only difference is that Spider-Man was made six years earlier. Also, the mind games that Two-Face plays with his victims reminded me of the horrifying games of Russian roulette during The Deer Hunter. Or quite possibly the game of life and death that Anton Chigurh plays with his victims in No Country for Old Men. Life is depended upon a single flip of the coin. Besides this movie not being very original, it was overall pretty good. The Spider-Man 3-like structure of bringing in a second villain halfway through and carrying on several subplots worked out for Dark Knight, I guess. I would recommend it if you have not seen any of the following movies. Otherwise, it is like watching a brilliantly directed sum-up of so many other better movies before The Dark Knight's time.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Elephant In The Room",
    "reviewBody": "My review contains some spoilers.Maybe everyone is afraid to say it, but there's an elephant in the room and it's that this movie was NOT as good as expected and certainly not as good as the hype implied. I'm compelled to call a spade a spade.Most movies (whether good or bad) know enough to have a beginning middle and end. This movie was ALL MIDDLE. It was a series of scenes strung together with no pacing to allude to how the overall time was passing, with no feeling of buildup and no distinction between what should be acts that define where you might be in the story line. I guarantee I'm not the only one out there who kept looking at my watch starting around the 1-hour mark and hoping the pace would be improved.I want to say good things. Heath Ledger's performance was good. The anti-moral undertones were ballsy for a mass-market movie. The 2-face special effects were handled perfectly. And I was a comic fan as a kid and any comic book movie, especially a batman one, deserves credit by default.Now the bad. One of the things that made the first movie great was the attempt to ground it totally in reality. Barely any suspension of disbelief was needed for \"Batman Begins\". But in this - sonar cell phones? Uh, what? In short time turning every cell phone in Gotham into a sonar real-time 3D tracking system for the entire city with real-time 3D visuals all being fed into some location, somewhere...? What? And then the glowing goggles that somehow received the signal... What? Was this an attempt to use a farcical James Bond jump-the-shark plot device to make the writing a lot easier near the end? Where's the back-story for The Joker? He's just some loony? What's his motivation? OK he burns a pile of money. How does he get anything done without money? Do all his hired guns work for free? The ones that it takes to move hundreds of barrels of explosive fuel into all kinds of locations throughout the movie. 2 warehouses, 2 boats, a hospital...The costume modification mid-way was weak and made batman LOOK weak. The actress change, then killing her anyway. Why not just create a different character for the love interest? The joker was EVERYWHERE at all times, like an omniscient god. Give me a break. Nothing was played out as plausible. Maggie Gyllenhaal is NOT ATTRACTIVE (at least not for the character she's supposed to be playing). Bale's voice while as Batman was too forced and was over-the-top. The story drags and drags. No mansion? A penthouse in a city that looks nothing like Gotham is supposed to look. It was a shiny upscale city that looked more like upscale Manhattan. I could go on, but basically there were another 50 times like that in the movie where, rather than helping me immerse into the story, it made me go \"huh?\"",

And should get and Oscar nomination; this is no sympathy for his death, because he makes Jack Nickelson's version look like a Saint. Don't get me wrong, his performance was still great.

I have seen all of the old movies, and I was expecting good things from this one. First off, I would like to comment on something I am sure everyone has already heard. Heath Ledger. His acting in this movie was the best. He took the character, and made it his own. I love to see actors go above and beyond the task of reading lines, and add in a bit of life. His character was believable, as well as creepy. I know that I personally was affected every time he read a line. He stole the show for me.Secondly, I think that the script was one of the best. True human nature was perfected by it. I also, once again, loved the Joker. His part itself made me fall in love with this movie.The only thing that irritated me was (spoiler) 1. The fact that two-face did not get much screen time 2. And once two-face was made, the movie seemed to drag on a little, and then you realize that it is not the end, and the movie speeds up a little.All in all, this is one of my favourite movies, and everything from the costumes to the characters was superb. 10/10!",

I thought the storyline involving those who pretended to be Batman was quite compelling in that Bruce indeed became the symbol he intended to be in Batman Begins. The story presents some fantastic ethical dilemmas to those caught in The Joker's \"jokes;\" the sequence involving the boats was emotionally powerful while not focusing on the main characters at all.

Wayne Manor and the Batcave from Begins are cooler and darker than the penthouse and way to bright room where Batman now keeps his gear.2. I do not like seeing Batman walk around sort of hanging out with the police because it cheats the mystery of Batman a lot like Kilmer and Clooney's Batman's.3. There could of been more time with Batman fighting people. I think the ending sequence of Begins was more pumping than the ending of the Dark Knight.Aside from these few minor and practically non existent issues, The Dark Knight was a fantastic movie from beginning to end and I cant wait until Nolan makes another one.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers.",
    "reviewBody": "A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike",
    "reviewBody": "Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. \"The Dark Knight\" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against \"The Dark Knight.\" From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, \"The Dark Knight\" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman.",

    "reviewBody": "I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark, brilliant, and the best movie of the year.",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight was setting records even before its release. The hype was on since late 2007, and was only fueled by the sudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger in January. Did The Dark Knight live up to the massive expectations? Yes. Definitely.The story progresses very well, and the 2 and half hour running time flies by. Pay attention though, or you may get lost.The action is plentiful, and there is just the right amount. Not too much, not too little. There aren't too many explosions just for show, and the special effects look great.Performances Christian Bale is spot on as the tormented defender of Gotham. He gives a very believable performance in one scene of raw emotion that I won't spoil here.Michael Caine once again plays Alfred in a role that makes him a mentor/friend even more so than in Begins, or any of the older movies for that matter.Morgan Freeman also reprises his role as Lucius Fox, who once again supplies Bruce with the gadgets and cutting-edge technology he needs to combat crime.Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes from Batman Begins, plays Rachel Dawes, a pivotal character in the movie, and in the lives of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. Even if you think Gyllenhaal may not be much of a looker, she certainly has far more charisma than Holmes in the role.Newcomer Aaron Eckhart debuts in the series as Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, and a shining ray of hope on the corrupt Gotham City. Batman thinks he may be the man who may make Gotham no longer need Batman. However, fans of the comics know who he is destined to become.And last, but most certainly not least, Heath Ledger.From the trailers alone, I could tell he was going to give a commanding performance, but I was not expecting this. Ledger completely disappears into the role, and is virtually unrecognizable. He easily gives the best performance of the movie as the psychopathic, sadistic Joker. It is unfortunate and sad he will not be able to reprise his role in the third film, if there will be one.The Dark Knight is easily the best film of the year so far, and by far the darkest. I won't say much, but don't be surprised if you don't get a happy ending.In my opinion, the best film of the year, and the best Batman and superhero movie ever.",

    "reviewBody": "The best superhero movie ever. The whole movie i never lost interest and there were moments of almost unbearable suspense. I have never been more excited to see a movie.The Joker was excellent. The first time i went on to the Dark knight page i saw that The Joker was going to be played by Heath Ledger. I thought Heath Ledger? really. I thought he would suck. Then i saw the trailer then my 'Heath is gonna suck' thoughts were blown up in my face he looked awesome.When i left the movie i thought he was beyond awesome he was incredible. He had delivered the best performance from anyone that i have seen. It was like Hannibal Lector only better. If he doesn't win the awards then the awards are rigged. When i see characters being portrayed all i see is a actor. When i saw Ledger's Joker i saw a sadistic maniac. Sadly Heath Ledger died. This is a perfect performance to have on your final(completed)film.I highly recommend this. Nolan really knows how to make a movie. Every single thing in this movie was superb(except for Bale's Batman voice). Drop everything and go see it now. It was worth the wait. It is one of my favorites.10/10",

    "reviewTitle": "Who ever said becoming was better than become?",
    "reviewBody": "It's an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the original--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT squashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and excitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible. BATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Wayne's roots and his journey to becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is still solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dent's (an excellent Aaron Eckhart) crusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a hero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what supplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the film's dark turns all the more poignant and suspenseful. Everything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable) to the violence (the Joker's disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath Ledger. If Ledger hadn't died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldn't have been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still would've been higher than the skies. To say that his performance is majestic isn't enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowell's astonishing performance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that \"I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma.\" That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who seems so comfortable with his madness it's truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, \"this must've been what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died.\" Ledger will become a cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his exquisite madness, you're able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what will remain.The only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes got a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom Cruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generation's answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruce's life, it's awkward to have another actress cast in that role. It's like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman falling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and somewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and it's only a minor annoyance to a practically perfect movie.This is the film we've all been waiting for, and it's the film we deserve. I hope you all take in the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is lost, but with this film, it'll never be forgotten.",

    "reviewTitle": "Let's be honest - They should just call this movie \"The Joker\"",
    "reviewBody": "Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again. Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly: If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff \"Batman\" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of \"Two-Face.\" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie. I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.",

    "reviewBody": "The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words. The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache'. This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie.Do not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many \"Aces\" in the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come.\"The Dark Knight\" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives.Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacle.There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic.In simple words. It is a 10 on 10 and must see.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time!",
    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight is the follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Now I thought Batman Begins was amazing, I mean it is one of my favorite films of all-time. To sum it up, I was very pumped about the sequel, but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that The Dark Knight might not be as good as Batman Begins, but finally after three years of waiting I can say that The Dark Knight is not just as good as Begins, but it in fact blows it out of the water. The story of The Dark Knight follows Batman on his continuing crusade to rid Gotham City of crime. In this film Batman begins to see hope for both him and Gotham in the hopes of the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Batman feels that Gotham needs a hero with a face, and he believes that Dent is that hero, not Batman. Of course, Batman's hopes are soon shattered by the arrival of a new criminal mastermind calling himself the Joker.As I have already said, The Dark Knight is amazing, you could call it a masterpiece, but that just doesn't seem to fully sum up how blown away I was by this film. To start, the directing by Christopher Nolan is superb, reinforcing once more that he is quite possibly the film industries greatest current filmmaker. On top of that the cinematography by Wally Pfister is amazing, and I really think it is about time he finally wins an Oscar for his work. Then the score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is perfect, fitting each scene perfectly. Finally the script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is perfect, flowing perfectly from scene to scene, making this 2 and a 1/2 hour film feel as if it lasted only 90 minutes, but in a good way. Of course the true highlight of the film is the acting from the all-star cast, all actors turn in perfect performances, including: Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllennhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes; though the one performance that truly stands out ahead of the others is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, he was amazing, this role just fit him like a glove, and he truly deserves a post-humous Oscar win.In final thought, the Dark Knight is epic, emotional, and exciting, all at the same time. I loved this film, it was tense and disturbing while being at times a little comical through the Joker's odd, dark sense of humor. I could go on all day long talking about how perfect this film was, but I'll try to wrap things up here. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of 2008, and should definitely be considered for some big-time Oscars, in particular Heath Ledger's stunning performance as the Joker; but not only is The Dark Knight the year's best film, it is the best film of the decade thus far. The Dark Knight is the Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time, and definitely stands in my books as one of the Greatest Films of All-Time. It is a true masterpiece.The Dark Knight earns a perfect 10 out of 10!",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight became the third movie I've gone to a midnight showing for (the other two being Revenge of the Sith and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and it was by far the best of those films. The energy in the auditorium was palpable. There were times when we collectively gasped, laughed, and cheered.For fans of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is grittier, funnier, and more complicated. As a matter of fact, the film's only drawback is the complicated storytelling. It made the film two and half hours long, and, moreover, it felt two and a half hours long. Also, the PG-13 rating in America, is quite serious. There are some truly gruesome images and Heath Ledger's Joker is one of the most menacing villains ever to appear on the screen. One villain in the host of supporting baddies who got the short end of the stick in the last film and in this one, was Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. I almost wish they'd left him out entirely, instead of giving the boy a lousy send-off twice, because Murphy could be a fantastic villain in the third film, in my opinion, anyway.The rest of the returning cast is fantastic, as expected. Christian Bale is perfect as Gotham's self-sacrificing Dark Knight, and he also did a great job with the billionaire playboy side of Bruce Wayne. The banter between Bale and Michael Caine is pitch perfect and is responsible for one of the funniest scenes in the film. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are also given a chance to shine in this film. Oldman was especially fantastic as Jim Gordon. Aaron Eckhart is a great Harvey Dent, and I have an easier time with the chemistry between him and Maggie Gyllenhaal than between Gyllenhaal and Bale. While Maggie Gyllenhaal is her usual great self, it's difficult to pretend that she's Rachel Dawes, not only because she's not physically Katie Holmes, but she's practically playing a different character. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far.Overall, it was a fantastic film and a great second installment. My only question is, how will they top themselves for the third one?",

    "reviewTitle": "The Joker is Real",
    "reviewBody": "Watching the various Batman incarnations over the years, from the Adam West era, through the Superfriends, Tim Burton and Friends, and the very excellent Bruce Timm Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, we are faced with various versions of the Joker.The Animated Series Joker was voiced by Mark Hamill, and is considered by many fans to be the best Joker up to now. He certainly is creepy, and in the film spin-offs he does actually murder people explicitly on occasion, but though he is good it's hard to imagine him existing outside of the art deco alternate universe of Bruce Timm. He's just not unpredictable enough. He has steady henchmen who trust him enough to turn their backs on him.Jack Nicholson's Joker was well-received at the time, but he too suffered from a believability gap, in addition to being over the top and, while crazy, not quite creepy.Enter the Dark Knight's Heath Ledger: the freak make-up, the crazy, but disturbingly lucid philosophy, the complete lack of empathy for other people, and the scary practice of killing people for fun and without warning, his fondness for knives. I can actually imagine running into a character like this in a city somewhere. Certainly, not quite as complete, the real-life version wouldn't have the smarts to pull off so many grand schemes along with all the pure evil traits (you hope), but there are a small number of people out there who share some of the Joker's characteristics, and that's what makes Ledger's character so creepy, so scary.Every scene he is in, accompanied by music that would feel at home in any Hitchcock or horror film, is filled with a sense of tension and dread. What horror will he next bring upon the people standing before him? Who's next? Without a doubt the best Joker ever, Ledger's performance did not feel at all like a comic book superhero movie bad guy. I was thinking more like Hannibal Lechtur. Intelligent, lucid, menacing, and, I'm convinced, not really insane, but horribly sane, with a tendency to view life as pointless and thus amusing.Oh, yeah, the rest of the movie? That was good, too. Eckhart's Harvey Dent was also very satisfying, with no campiness to bring it down. His trajectory from ace prosecutor to criminal Two-Face is very well-done. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, and Gyllenhall are all well-cast. The action is better than Batman Begins, with the fistfight scenes in particular being easier on the eyes, with less spastic camera motion. The writing and direction is more along the lines of a crime drama or an action film than a comic book adaptation, and the story starts off with action and keeps you going for the whole 2.5 hours.Very dark, violent, and very well-done film all around.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Towering Achievement",
    "reviewBody": "Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" reminds us that even a product of mass-market pop-culture can, if done correctly, be a work of art. This thrilling, densely plotted and beautifully crafted sequel to 2005's \"Batman Begins\" is, quite possibly, the finest comic book superhero movie ever made. In addition, it boasts, in the performance of Heath Ledger, one of the definitive screen villains of all time.As the movie begins, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) - with the unofficial aid of the \"vigilante crime fighter\" known as Batman (Christian Bale) - is getting ready to indict most of Gotham City's most notorious criminals and gangsters on racketeering and money-laundering charges. The fly in the ointment is the psychotic, face-painted super villain, self identified as The Joker, who's joined forces with the seedy criminal elements of the city to bring both Batman and the terrorized inhabitants to their knees. Meanwhile, billionaire Bruce Wayne is trying to find a way to render his Batman alter ego unnecessary by finding an incorruptible civic leader who will be able to rid the city of its criminal elements through wholly legal means and, thus, become the heroic figure for the city that Batman himself can never be. He alights on Dent as the man for that job.As writers, the Nolan brothers, Jonathan and Christopher, have created a work that is so dark and despairing in its probing of the evil that infests our world that it makes the 1989 Tim Burton version look like an episode from the campy TV series in comparison. The forces of good in this movie are entirely at the mercy of the forces of evil, so terrifyingly embodied in the Joker figure. With his face painted into a ghoulish grin, Ledger's Joker strikes terror not merely into the characters in the movie but the audience as well. Not since Anthony Hopkins did his turn as Hannibal Lecter (a character Ledger himself cited as a primary source of inspiration for this role) has one actor imparted such a quality of dread and menace to the character he was playing. It is, indeed, a tribute to Ledger's greatness as an actor that, even after all the myriad screen villains we have encountered over the years, he has the power to makes us cringe every time he appears on screen. Indeed, so convincing is Ledger in the part that we sometimes wonder if even Batman himself will have what it takes to defeat him (and isn't that the measure of a truly effective bad guy?). For this Joker's true strategic advantage lies not in all the weapons of destruction he has at his disposal, but, rather, in his astute understanding of human psychology, particularly in his knowledge of how to make terror and fear work to get him what he wants. His delight in mind games, his devotion to torture, and his love of violence for its own sweet sake make him a figure fit to haunt one's dreams.There are other fine performances as well in the movie, including Eckhart as the honest D.A., Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce's former (and the D.A.'s current) flame, Gary Oldman as the ever reliable Lieutenant Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Wayne Industries' most erstwhile employee, and Michael Caine as Wayne's devoted and down-to-earth butler. It's inevitable, perhaps, that Bale, as the good guy of the piece, would fall under the shadow of Ledger's towering achievement, but he provides the strength and solidity the picture needs to keep it from going out of whack.Using what would appear to be a minimum of CGI effects, Nolan has mounted his film with a fine eye for detail and a great deal of jaw-dropping visual artistry. The cityscapes alone are enough to take the audience's breath away. Moreover, the screenplay weaves seamlessly between full-throttle, pull-out-all-the-stops action sequences and intense, highly intimate exchanges between characters.Like all movies that run a little longer than they should, \"The Dark Knight\" does hit a point of diminishing turns long about its last half hour, as the story loses its way a bit and the thematic point-making threatens to run it into the ground. Heck, even Ledger's performance loses some of its edge towards the end, as the novelty begins to wear off due to overexposure (he is probably in one or two scenes too many in the final analysis).Still, these are minor quibbles about a movie and a performance that will go down as classics in their respective categories.",

    "reviewBody": "Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth. This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight. The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc. No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!",

    "reviewTitle": "Fire in the Knight",
    "reviewBody": "Gotham city has seen better days.The Joker's terror campaign has both the public, and even its criminals living in fear. One day, Alfred relates a story of his early days in Burma, to a ponderous Bruce Wane. He tells Mr. Wayne how he and his men began to hunt a jewel thief who was on a killing rampage in the jungle. A man who actually threw the jewels he stole away, because this was just a man \"who wanted to watch the world burn.\"Bruce asks Alfred how did they catch him?\"We burnt the jungle down.\"The opening images of Batman announces this theme of fire, with the Bat signal simmering among blue flames. Gotham has indeed seen better days. And the opening of the film announces, better days are not coming soon. As the joker announces, \"people will die tonight, I'm a man of my worrrrd.\" Oh yes, the jungle is going to burn down, by one hand or the next.In the Dark Knight Christopher Nolan clearly strove to do justice to the Batman character and the world he inhabits to degrees and depths of character rarely seen before in a \"comic book\" movie. He has delivered a true epic. Though he still hasn't a clue how to film fight scenes and also dances a fine line of too much story and too many characters. There was obviously more than enough material here for two movies. However, I am very happy things worked out as they did. The movie is a triumph of vision both in the new realization of the joker, and in the practical manifestation of the Two-Face character. Aaron Eckhart is sufficiently pretty and viscous as Harvey Dent. Heath Ledger is hilariously creepy, yet I feel both probably deserved a little more screen time. Again, Nolan was juggling a high wire act with all these characters and themes, but yes again, I feel he was almost without fault in doing so. Both of these characters will be remembered. With the Joker, Jack Nicholson's turn in 1989s Batman was menacing and funny. A bravura performance for sure. But I think there was a touch of nostalgia, and tongue in cheek humor in how he played the role to keep him from being frightening. Heath Ledger, on the other hand has succeeded in bringing a more truthful version of the Joker's homicidal rage from the comic to the screen. Ledger's Joker is funny, but not \"haha\" funny. There are no hand buzzers or whoopie cushions here. He's really something to behold on screen and I feel both Batman movies' portrayals can live side by side in their interpretations for some time to come. Famously modeled in some way after Michael Mann's \"Heat,\" with Gotham city as the protagonist, the Dark Knight is a chase film of double crosses and revenge killings. It widens the narrative scope of the Batman Begins story-line and confronts the realities of one man's mission and principals to make right, what was once very wrong. This is a film, a true epic film, that engages Batman in a grand struggle against evil, some of which is his own making. Much like in Nolan's \"The Prestige,\" the idea of \"getting your hands dirty\" reminds us of the type of world that created Batman in the first place; a dark world of shadows and shades of gray. The Dark Knight is a poem of nobility and justice; a story about the futility and illusions of control. This is a story of the struggle between two sides of the same coin. One man who wants to burn the jungle down and another who will burn the jungle down to stop him. In the concluding soliloquy Batman says, \"people deserve something better than the truth.\" I couldn't agree more. America too has seen better days and this Batman is wondrous pure fiction at the right time. It's a venture down the obscured paths of humanity about a Knight among the darkness. You bet this is better than the truth. This stuff is why we go to the movies in the first place.",

    "reviewTitle": "A gritty hard-boiled thriller that will leave you breathless and wanting more",
    "reviewBody": "Words cannot describe the awe I feel for The Dark Knight.I usually try and wind myself down before getting too hyped over movies, but The Dark Knight was different. This was a Batman movie, almost completely like no other.Somehow, despite being immensely hyped for it, The Dark Knight basically shattered all of my expectations and more.The film focuses on four different characters. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is still playing the vigilante Gotham loves and fears, but is wrestling with his commitment to the job. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is one of the few good cops left, and is trying to end the crime. Newly elected District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fighting against the scum of Gotham, and trying to make it a safe place again. And of course, there's The Joker (Heath Ledger), a psychopathic terrorist determined to ensure chaos rules Gotham City.The film handles these plot threads rather delicately. It knows that with the slightest force, it could throw the entire course of the film off. For every moment of greatness these stories development, it reverts and dodges bumpy, cliché-ridden paths. It works because it aims to be unique the whole way through. Writer/director Christopher Nolan (with the help of his brother Jonathan) bit off a lot putting this movie together, but in their dedication to detail and to an inherently complex story, it manages to feel simplistic (and somehow manages to add a bit of emphasis on smaller plot lines involving mobsters and a love triangle between Wayne, Dent and fellow D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Batman Begins' horrendously weak link Katie Holmes)).But in accomplishing the complete synthesis of the main plot lines, the Nolan brothers have also managed to make a truly one of a kind film. Yes, it does build off some ideas from Begins, but it does not depend on them. This film is one that can truly stand on its own, and is an exceptional enough sequel that you do not necessarily need to see the first film to understand what happens here (although it sure does help). It tells its own story, and relies very little on previously related materials. It is what every good sequel should set out to be like. And thankfully, it revels in all the corruption and darkness that the Batman films should have always been about. The grittiness and fearlessness of this film is unlike almost any comic book film ever made, and I doubt it will soon be replicated.But in creating such a screenplay, there is an inherent issue with length. Batman Begins felt a bit too longwinded, and could have rather easily been trimmed. The Dark Knight on the other hand, while it feels too long for true comfort, does not have any bulky areas. It is very spot-on with its scenes, and nearly every scene has a reason to be in the film. If anything was to be done away with, I think the film would have been a much less and not so fulfilling effort (not to mention would lose its thrilling edge it keeps up for the entirety of the movie). So while it does feel a bit too lengthy, it lacks the superfluous nature that films like these usually have. I could have appreciated a few changes made to a near ending action sequence (as it felt a bit too ridiculous and rushed for its own good), but it could have been a whole lot worse.Another area the film shines in is the impeccable special effects. Every last detail is perfect, and not once did I not believe what I was seeing. It amps up everything Begins had, and makes it better. Specific scenes that would have looked horrendously fake years ago look miraculous here. And the speed fighting that plagued Begins has disappeared to a certain extent, leaving the audience a much better way of seeing the action. And of course, the makeup to bring both villains to life (especially a certain 'Two-Faced' character) is beyond extraordinary. It is downright terrifying for how real it looked, at any time.Acting wise, everyone does a fairly great job.Bale, while overshadowed more so than last time, builds upon his pathos-ridden superhero and brings certain three-dimensionality to him. We can see the hurt in his eye, and can see the pain. Even when the majority of his face is covered, he brings an excellent sense of emotion to the character. Much the same goes for Eckhart's Harvey Dent, who spends most of the movie doing what he thinks is right. He is a boy scout for the ages, and delivers a richness and depth to the character I did not think possible. Oldman does another superb job playing Gordon. He was an anchor in Begins, and here he does even more work.Gyllenhaal, while a much better thespian than Holmes, is not given nearly enough to do here. She is not totally useless, but she looks and sounds held back by the confines of the role. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are used very sparingly as well, but when they appear, they do a great job.Which leaves me with Ledger's Joker.Just about everything you have heard about his portrayal is true. He is a complete psychopath, and is totally unrecognizable in the role. You may laugh at some of his shenanigans, but then will take them back when you see the horrifying things he says and does. This brilliant performance is even better than I could have hoped, and is enough to see the movie alone. He may have died, but you will wish he would come back and start acting the moment he opens his mouth.For its small amount of problems, The Dark Knight still manages to be uncompromising in its uniqueness and greatness. It will leave you breathless, and craving more.9/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Why calling this \"The best superhero movie to date\" is an understatement",
    "reviewBody": "To talk about the strengths of \"The Dark Knight\" as a superhero film and why it's probably the best superhero film yet, would be to sell it incredibly short. This film is more than about satisfying comic book fans, action junkies and thrill seekers: it is a gripping tale of corruption, crime and justice that tries mightily to pry at an understanding of human nature. Director and writer Christopher Nolan has made his case for why the superhero genre can be just as capable of delivering a view and critique of society as a crime drama--and still leave room for a plenty of explosive entertainment for dessert.Of course \"Dark Knight\" is no \"The Godfather\" (though Bale's Batman voice often becomes as raspy as Marlon Brando's), but it's still wildly successful at addressing crime in its own way-- through impeccable and frightening characters like The Joker and scene after scene of chaos and mayhem. Unlike its predecessor \"Batman Begins,\" this film paints a grimmer Gotham City that feels more like real life and less like the pages of a comic book--and it echoes throughout all aspects of the film. Chicago proves an excellent city to serve this purpose too and it's amazing what they allowed this crew to do in their streets.No worries though, the real life feel doesn't sacrifice the thrills of a superhero action film. Nolan and his crew do unbelievable stunt work (the CGI is incredibly scarce) and The Joker schemes up some stuff that results in terrific fight scenes and action sequences, all of which are way better than the first \"rebirth of Batman\" installment. The script, though true to the constantly thematic-focused material of \"Begins,\" is also more sophisticated and even less cheesy this time around. It's sheer genius and best of all--it doesn't try and do too much like so many over-hyped superhero films before it.The story takes place with Gotham back in a place of corruption, but when new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) shows up and starts putting guys behind bars (with some help from Batman and Lt. Gordon (Oldman)) the crime lords turn to The Joker (the late Heath Ledger, whose performance will go down in the books and define his short but excellent career) in order to put an end to it. The only thing is that they don't understand The Joker-- he's motivated by pure desire for chaos and that will make him Batman's most formidable foe.With the amount of intriguing characters and great actors involved, the focus shifts away from Bruce Wayne in this movie and it becomes more about identifying Batman's role in the crime-fighting puzzle. This focal shift makes \"Dark Knight\" a true ensemble piece. When The Joker is on screen, you won't take your eyes off of him. Ledger captures his chaos, his theatricality, his crude sense of humor and channels it towards the themes the script pushes. His lines are the best in the film and not only in delivery but pure craftsmanship. He's the glue of this film--not Bale/Batman. Eckhart is an excellent Harvey Dent and a solid Two-Face. Filmgoers (specifically Batman fans) should know that his role is very central to the film and his emergence as Two-Face ends up being the whipped cream and the cherry. Not only do you get the story of a strong hero challenged by an incredibly complex villain, but you get an origin story of a man turning from good to evil. No superhero writing team has ever put so much complexity into a script and made it work without becoming a disappointing train wreck, but the Nolan brothers do. There are some bumps, but you're so sucked in it doesn't matter.So it's easy to label \"The Dark Knight\" the best superhero film to date, because it delivers everything you want with an artists touch on every piece of it. What I will dare to say is this film is one of if not the best crossover between entertainment and crime drama. Combine that with the most successful and biggest viral marketing campaign ever and this film has changed the way we watch movies. But most specifically, It's thematically bulletproof and those who love superhero movies that explore the deepest depths of its themes will easily name \"The Dark Knight\" one of their favorite films.",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark, sinister, haunting. More than a comic book movie.",
    "reviewBody": "Yes, it's true. He's done it. After reviving the 'Batman' brand three years ago, Christopher Nolan has done the unthinkable. The impossible. Not only has he outdone himself and the wildest of expectations, but Nolan has created a comic book movie that transcends the limits of its genre to become something so much more. So dark, so sinister. 'The Dark Knight' is a masterpiece, and it has all the makings of a timeless classic. Not merely a movie about good versus evil, but about the evil born out of good. And the toll it takes on those who fight it.There's no doubt that the mind of Christopher Nolan is a dark place. We've seen it before, which made Nolan an interesting choice to pick up the broken franchise. Did they comprehend exactly what they were getting themselves into? Probably not. Needless to say, one studio's gamble has been our tremendous gain. 'Batman Begins' was a remarkable re-visioning of the Caped Crusader's roots, but it is with 'The Dark Knight' that Nolan unleashes his twisted fury with impeccable precision and horrific brilliance. He aims high, far and above what any other superhero has ever tackled before. The results are startling.Saving a city, protecting innocent people, questioning your habits. This is not foreign territory that 'The Dark Knight' is invading, but it doesn't seek out the easy answers. Christian Bale once again inhabits the bat costume, and he delivers an exquisite performance of a sincere man, but a tortured soul. The moral dilemmas presented to us run deep, as Bruce Wayne doesn't simply battle his inner demons, but a worldview that breeds chaos and thrives on anarchy. Where good men trying to do the right thing can be brought down to the depths of hell, that within us all lies a savage and barbaric beast. Dog eat dog.Yes, that's the Joker. A nihilistic psychopath, you're not sure whether you should chuckle at his clever gestures or shudder in eerie fear. It was a role that would have made him the superstar he deserved to be, a role that would forever carry his name. Heath Ledger did not live to see his brilliant work on the big screen, but he would be proud. He really is that good. It's evident he went to a very dark place to construct this malicious Joker, and he will always be remembered for delivering one of the most haunting, disturbing performances ever put to screen. Chaos for the sake of chaos, mass destruction for a little bit of fun and disorder.'The Dark Knight' soars among some of the best crime dramas ever told. A skillfully complex story that serves not only as an adrenaline rush of pure entertainment, but home to many profound ideas of power, politics, corruption, and the simple decency of mankind. Nolan uses Gotham City as a universal concept, not a crime-ridden city patrolled by a man in a bat costume that exists purely in the mind of its creator. It reaches across into our world, and effectively says something very powerful and unsettling about our morality. Harvey Dent sadly represents all of these things, and through the help of the very talented Aaron Eckhart, gives a face to these troubling but necessary ideas.'The Dark Knight' will get under your skin, and it should. It isn't satisfied with simply being one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comic book movie ever made, it goes even further into a land rarely occupied by cinema but reserved only for the best. On the outside, 'The Dark Knight' is everything a summer blockbuster should be. The action is thrilling, the air of suspense is thick, the production values are top-notch and gorgeous to watch and look at. But underneath lays a core with many complicated layers, and Nolan is just getting started. 'The Dark Knight' will haunt you, it will linger in your memory. The freakishly twisted villains, a hero nobody wants. This is an unforgettable film, a masterful accomplishment whose own ambition is stunning and timely. Christopher Nolan is trying to tell us something, and he's using Batman to tell that story. Do yourself a favor and listen.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",

    "reviewTitle": "I had high expectations and they were met, if not exceeded.",
    "reviewBody": "Leading up to seeing this movie, I had read dozens of reviews, mostly of praise for \"The Dark Knight\". But amongst the praise was critiques, and there were many reviews with the same critiques, making me worried this movie would only be good because of it's flaws. One of the mentioned flaws was that this film was very slow paced. I don't know what movies some reviewers saw, but though this is long, it is not slow paced, in fact, you could say it's the exact opposite. Especially towards the beginning, this is a fast paced movie, with lots of action. Along with that, it's one of the best movies of the year, and though it may sound clichéd to say this in a Dark Knight review, Heath Ledger will be remembered for this role, if any, as his finest moment(s) on the silver screen.Gotham City is in peril, and the only person who can save it is...Harvey Dent. New District Attorney Harvey Dent is bringing men to justice and throwing them in the clink, sometimes by the hundreds. Harvey's got a great girl, Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) old flame, Rachel Dawes (Now played by Maggie Gyllenhall). The Joker (Heath Ledger) is the new psycopath in town, and Batman, or Harvey Dent must stop him.What makes the Dark Knight so great is how well it works as both a superhero movie, and an action drama. If this wasn't a Batman movie, it would still be a fantastic action flick, not to say Batman is a throw away character, because he certainly isn't. The direction is very good, though there are a few action scenes that could have been filmed better.Heath Ledger is the performance that makes the movie, not because this was the movie that led to his unfortunate demise, but because he was amazing and captivating. Whether or not he will win Best Supporting Actor, he still has gotten critical acclaim for his portrayal of the psychopath. His performance is not a let down, he is just great. The other actors all do well too. Normally I think of Aaron Eckhart as being a B-movie actor, but here he shows what makes him a star. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, and okay as Batman. That annoying scratchy voice is, well, annoying. It's overused. Batman even uses it to talk to people that know he is Bruce Wayne. Maybe the suit cuts off his lungs or something. Maggie Gyllenhall is a fine actress in the role, though for varying reasons it felt a bit off having her playing Rachel. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman added a lot in supporting roles, and Gary Oldman plays a heck of a Officer/Commissioner Gordon.Now onto the negatives. The beginning of the movie had way too many short scenes of random characters that it felt like an anthology, and it didn't explain itself well enough until later. When the scenes began to be longer and stopped jumping from character to character, the movie got much better. One element missing from the film is drama that connects with the audience. Drama was plentiful, but I never felt connected with the characters enough to care what happens, probably because of the fast cut opening that helped to underdevelop the characters until later in the film.I miss Danny Elfman. His musical score brought life to the first two Batman films, and the musical score here is just loud and annoying and adds nothing. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard are talented, so what were they doing here? Overall, this was one of the better Batman movies, and is also one of the best movies of the year. It's not perfect, but perfection is hard to find, and even in it's imperfection, it outshines most movies this year.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. PG-13 for violence.",

    "reviewTitle": "I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I will see it again and again.",
    "reviewBody": "Best. Batman. Film. Ever.My faith in the Nolans was amply rewarded. After \"Batman Begins,\" I was concerned that Hollywood had more effect on them than they had on it.But this film had a much better story than the first one, not quite as Hollywooded-up as the first one, darker than the first one, and Heath was achingly good. After every one of his scenes, I found myself doing a nervous, creeped-out laugh because of his chilling portrayal of madness.The action sequences were chaotic, poorly choreographed and boring, except for a couple of times when they focused on clever maneuvers by Batman (good idea, as that's all we really care about, not a bunch of random violent punching and kicking nonsense). But the good news is that there were not as many action sequences as I expected -- the story turned on plot, not on what happened with stupid car chases and explosions.I actually wondered, by the end, if the Nolans weren't a little bit making fun of the genre with the way they handled the action. It was a caricature of itself, overblown, impossible to follow and really boring -- and yet the movie was freaking incredible anyway. It kinda shows you that a good superhero film doesn't really need action sequences.Back to the important stuff: the story. The moral tangles that unfolded were smart, just a little bit complicated and very nicely handled. Not as much macho-crap bravado and \"honor\" nonsense as the first and more actual dilemmas about the consequences of our behavior, both good and bad.The focus on morality combined with the strong story turned what could have been just another good superhero movie into a piece of cinema history that transcends its genre -- this is a three-act opera, a tragedy of epic proportions and a dark, nasty comedy.Overall, bravo! And thank you, Nolans. I'm glad you did better than \"Begins.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "An Objective Review",
    "reviewBody": "I have never been a comic book fan. The last one I ever read was an \"Archie\" from the 1960s. That being said, I do like adaptations of comics and graphic novels. They make great stories and even better movies that even reach the mainstream audiences. Recent example like \"Spiderman\", \"Ironman\" and \"The Incredible Hulk\" have shown that these films handle the crossover very well when in the hands of competent direction.I loved \"Batman Begins\". It seemed a much more realistic and serious attempt than the earlier \"Batman\" franchise movies. Even with Jack Nicholson as the Joker, those movies came off as more silly than fun.SPOILERS*** \"The Dark Knight\" was obviously on my short list of movies coming out this year that I really looked forward to. And overall, I wasn't disappointed. The is a really good movie. It is not, IMHO, an exceptional movie.It IS an exceptional performance by Heath Ledger. A true \"tour-de-force\", knock-you-upside-the-head, smile-till-it-hurts performance that makes the film stand out as this summer's best. Dead or alive, he deserves the Oscar and I'm betting he will get it, albeit posthumously.You can tell that he totally \"immersed\" himself in the role and that might have created the environment that led to his death, as reported. One can't easily move in and out of character when one takes it \"so seriously\", pun intended.But as I hinted in my overall enjoyment of the film, this performance alone does not make this an exceptional movie. I realize that the Fanboys are going to take exception to that comment. But if all aspects are looked at objectively, this, I believe, will be the common opinion.Christopher Nolan takes us on a great ride. He is easily placed near the top of a list of directors who can envision the transformation from comic to film with ease. He tells a great story, fills it with unique action sequences and captures the feel of the darkness that lives and breathes in Gotham City.But it is partly this \"capturing\" that keeps it from being a truly great film. The overall look of the picture is dark, very dark. Not just visually (which it is greatly) but also in a negative emotional level. Very few scenes show daylight. Very few scenes show hope. And at 152 minutes... that's a lot of \"darkness\" for a viewer to experience.Yes, I realize that the movie is called \"The Dark Knight\". And that \"darkness\" was an important factor in \"Batman Begins\" to let the audience feel what it is that drives Bruce Wayne to become this hero of the night. But in this episode, it just goes a bit too far. That coupled with Batman's gravely voice (done to extreme by Christian Bale) makes the movie hard to see and hard to hear. My ears aren't that great, but even someone with perfect hearing is going to have trouble getting all this dialogue, in one viewing, as it's often mumbled.The other performances are generally up to, or above, what you would expect from such a great line-up. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, give their usual perfect performances in roles that suit them well. And Gary Olldman is at the top of his form as Commissioner Gordan. This is one of the finer portions of the film as he gets to expand his character beyond past entries.Aaron Eckhart, I'm sure, did what it was that the director likely wanted for him but his performance is hurt by a mild flaw in the story writing. He plays the new District Attorney Harvey Dent who comes into town on a white horse, ready to take on any and all bad guys at any cost. But in the latter part of the story, he suddenly becomes unable to survive the \"any cost\" part. His love, Rachel Dawes (played sufficiently by Maggie Gyllenhaal, but not as tenderly as Katie Holmes did) dies near the end and suddenly this White Knight can't see beyond the pain to go after the true culprit in her death. He morbidly becomes \"Two Face\" (arch criminal in some Batman comics?) and blames Gordon and Batman for all his woes. This was the weakest part of the story for me, and I believe that had they left out this plot-line it would have made the movie a bit shorter (which would have helped the overall picture) and it would have kept the focus on the duel between Batman and the Joker, and that's where the focus of this film should never have strayed from. Just as in \"Spiderman 3\", this movie is hurt by 1 too many plot-lines.But these are simply minor annoyances that, although they do detract from the film, simply keep it from being the best Superhero movie of all time. That award, I think, still belongs to \"Spiderman\".In conclusion, go see \"The Dark Knight\", you will not be disappointed. And the performance by Heath Ledger is absolutely not to be missed. He makes Jack Nicholson's attempt look amateuristic, which it truly wasn't. But this one goes so close to perfection that anything pales in comparison.My rating for the movie would have been a 7+. add in Ledger's stellar performance (a perfect 10) and we get the movie close to a 9. A half point deduction for the \"Two Face\" distraction and the length and darkness of it and we end up at a very solid 8 and 1/2! I know that many fans will think this a perfect 10, and I can understand their point, but they are biased. For the overall movie lover who gets as much enjoyment out of \"WallE\" as he does \"Shawshank Redemption\", this movie will fall somewhere just below those but well above many others.",

    "reviewBody": "In 2005, British director Christopher Nolan directed \"Batman Begins\" a re-birth of the Batman franchise where not only fans get to see the dark side of Gotham City, but also the understanding of how Bruce Wayne came to be.Here, Christopher Nolan wastes no time with the action...Batman Begins ended with The Joker being the next villain for the next movie, and he, I repeat, he does not disappoint. The late Heath Ledger goes to extreme as the maniacal clown in the beginning of the movie where him and his thugs are robbing the Gotham City Bank; he shows a mean and sadistic side killing people left and right before leaving with the stolen money.Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), on the other hand, is bringing down the criminals one by one with the aid of Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) while joining forces of the new district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckert). He's also accompanied with his trusted butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) who guides him whether he's Batman or Bruce Wayne and gadgets expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who supplies everything that Batman needs to fight crime while at the same time Bruce is trying to rekindle things with his ex-girlfriend/district attorney Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllanhall replacing Katie Holmes) while she's going out with Harvey Dent.The film itself is a phenomenal from minute one where you can't keep your eyes off of the screen, even touching scenes will get to you. The premise of \"The Dark Knight\" has The Joker taking Gotham City hostage where he'll execute and hunt down people one by one unless Batman himself surrenders along with those who want to bring down the criminals. In other words, everybody is a ticking time bomb, including Batman and those around him, where the hero must be everywhere before the menacing clown will strike and not breaking his promise.The action sequences are promising where Christopher Nolan doesn't use much CGI to make it a true extravaganza. They have the sort of \"Holy Crap\" moments where your eyes don't want to shield away from the rest of the movie along with seeing if others are okay.As much as acting goes, there was not one flaw in each of the performances. Christian Bale is dynamic as the hero where not only is he playing two personas, but bringing human emotion as both the human and the savior. Oldman, Caine and Freeman have much larger roles where they're part of the action from secrecy to betrayal; Maggie Gyllanhall wasn't a flaw unlike Katie Holmes, and Aaron Eckhart played a convincing Dent, but the true star in this motion picture is Heath Ledger.Heath, who died at the age of twenty-eight in the beginning of 2008, plays not only one of the sadistic villains ever made on screen but one scary Joker compared to Romero (1960's) and Nicholson's (1989) campiness of the clown prince of crime and Mark Hamill's (animated Joker) cackling voice where there's no clowning around when it comes to blowing up buildings, using school buses to transport money, killing crime bosses and cops left and right to creating madness all around. Hopefully he'll receive a posthumous Oscar nomination for his work making him the first actor in a comic book movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.Once again, Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job of making a Batman movie where he steps it up a notch along with making it the top DC comic book movie ever made. Now whether you agree with my review or not, I really love \"The Dark Knight\".(Note: This is not a typical comic book movie for the young or weak hearted)",

    "reviewBody": "The Dark Knight, truly is dark and raw, it digs deep and provokes. Going in, I knew it was gonna be dark, but with this Shakespearian/Hamlet tragedy, it becomes so much more entirely. The movie deals so seamlessly with the ideas of human nature, psychological core, emotions of hate, revenge, torture, angst, betrayal, sadness. The action is notched up, and boy does it deliver. From the opening scene to the final scene, you will be spell-binded. You really don't know what's gonna happen next!Bale delivers a heartfelt performance, Oldman shines, ECKHART is amazing at the end, and of course Ledger well was the Joker himself. I couldn't even get past that the man behind the makeup was Heath. His character is absolute, but very complex, in that, credit to writers, his actions paradoxically have so much meaning. He too symbolizes an ideal, anarchy, and does so breathlessly illustrating his view of the world, that provokes and delivers some forbidden truth. The mythical, tragic overtones, themes, and character arcs make this film a masterpiece. Amazing, amazing, amazing.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Darkest of Knights",
    "reviewBody": "One of the ways I judge the quality of a movie is by how much attention the audience around me takes from my watching of the movie. With the exception of a couple of minutes at the beginning of The Dark Knight (when a little kid started talking to her mom, she was asleep soon after), I could not take my eyes off the screen.This is a truly exceptional piece of film making. I will not give anything away by telling you what happens. I have to say though that the acting of Heath Ledger is just spectacular. They give him a lot of lines in this movie, probably a lot more than most would expect to a comic book villain to get. In fact, this movie has more dialog period than most would expect in this type of movie. That was also the case in Batman Begins, but is even more so in this movie.While Heath was awesome, the other actors were almost as good. The only weak character was Rachel Dawes played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. I thought she was weak in Batman Begins, and she is even weaker here. But the strengths of the other characters/actors more than makes up for her.Anybody who enjoys these types of movies will love this one. Even if you don't enjoy them, you should see it. It's more than a comic book movie. Nolan has managed to bring so much more to the surface than just special effects and explosions.BTW, if Ledger doesn't at least get a nomination for Best Actor, that will be a shame. He deserves it.",

    "reviewTitle": "havoc, bale, ledger and eckhart ... Nolan lead the way please",
    "reviewBody": "i was immensely disappointed that this movie didn't release in the imax dome in India. but nonetheless i settled in for the first show in a normal sized theater with people waiting in anticipation for India's most loved super hero. people actually came in wearing the bat mask(rarity for India) i was shocked that most of the shows in other theaters were booked. i whistled when the movie started i was like a little girl in a Barbie shop waiting to buy a Barbie she has waited for for 6 months. the movie opens with a shot of Gotham city and throughout the movie we are treated to the wonderful pan shots. and at this point may i cite, this movie has no unnecessary shots, every shot speaks distinctively for itself and adds the extra bit to the movie. the acting is excellent. Bale is Batman. i guess there is no one else who can do a more perfect batman than bale. if batman was real he would be giving a standing ovation to bale. ledger, the man everyone has been waiting fro in this movie is fantabulous. he has given joker life, made him real rather than a stupid comic book villain. jokers funny but his humor catches you by your you know what and makes you wanna shudder. at one moment you are laughing and the other moment you realize you shouldn't have laughed, the joke wasn't funny, you laughed because you were scared. thats what he does to you. Aaron Eckhart ... what do you say about him? he is scarier than joker at times. his transition and anger outbursts are terrifying but at the same time remind you that he is probably one of the better actors around who is not duly recognized for his talent. he is terrifying and at some parts more scarier than joker.(his make up or whatever the hell they have done with his face adds to it) his face is horrible, you cant help looking at his eye and wish it stopped moving. also he gives something to the character of harvey dent, the Mr. do good to all and the man who has his own wars to face. he balances these dimensions to his character well. the script is flawless. it got everything right, the dialogs etc etc. Mr. Nolan probably the EST director around take a bow. this is your Oscar. after giving us excellent movies i guess this is your podium speech movie. the movie is chaotic. as the viewer at times you go dizzy trying to understand how can so much havoc be created. but Nolan handles it as though its pouring milk in a glass. this movie in the wrong hands would spell MESS i dunno about ledgers Oscar but Nolan should get recognized for this movie. watch it and be amazed. be blown away by probably one of the greatest movies ever made",

Perfection.I've never seen a movie in which there was so much going on, but it was all so perfect that there wasn't enough of any of it.The plot is so deep and so intricate, and yet so easy to follow. A cavalcade of characters that are so well defined. Every character gets ample time, and yet I wish there was more of everything.The film is so engrossing, and so expansive that I wish it was two movies. I just left wanting so much more. It gave me everything I expected and much more, and yet, it was so good that I still want more.It's a great film that is recommended to any fans of crime, drama, action, superhero, or adventure movies.It's not so much for kids as there are a lot of adult themes and perhaps too much plot for kids to follow.",

    "reviewTitle": "Oh, we got trouble in Gotham City",
    "reviewBody": "Difficult to assess, this film has ambition--big ambition--beyond an action film. Midway, I thought, \"Oh. This is a serious movie.\" That was welcome, but that's not why I got in line. Expecting a slam-bam big summer action film (and it is partially that), the film reaches very far into the American and International psyche on the role of evil, the fragility of good, the ambivalence of governments on the subject of right/wrong.... It's a longer list than that, but Nolan strives for something very deep here. It's close to \"The French Connection\" in the intricate plot and reversals of the protagonist who is pushed to abandon his fight for right and seek revenge OR...to find personal happiness OR...to continue the battle he's begun....About 3/4 of the way through the film, the weight of all of this begins to strain the interest of the audience. However, it never sells itself short like it does the audience. We're \"told\" what the film is about, and I think the screenplay would have been stronger had the audience been left to piece that together for themselves. Catharsis is taken over by the characters and not the audience.Still, there's gobs to enjoy: I found the soundtrack (Zimmer/Newton Howard)splendid. They use a similar device that John Williams used in \"Jaws,\" alerting us that either there's a man in a bat suit about to appear or a fellow with a painted smile is about to do something really, really awful.The performances can't be faulted. Christian Bale is suitably brooding in all of this without once appealing to our sentiment. And then there's Heath Ledger. After all the build up, you wouldn't think he could live up to the hype. It's not a stunt but the embodiment of madness that we see laid out (sometimes to our delight). Finally, though, he's a force that we dread, and that's one of the accomplishments of this film: a cartoon character is fully realized as not just a villain, but all the psychotic terror we see in today's news.Before the film, the projectionist announced that several of the scenes were filmed in Imax, and the screen frame ratio would change. I thought, \"That's going to be stupid.\" It's not. When the Imax camera flies through various locations, it's breathtaking. The largest action set piece (roughly 2/3rd's into the film) ups the ante for every action film to follow. It's absolutely stunning. If you think you've seen all the car chases you care to, wait until you see this one (well, it's trucks, but the same idea).Brilliantly edited, the film never gives us spectacle for it's own sake. The cinematography is dark, many of the scenes are done in close up, but when the action opens up, we're aware this is epic film-making at its best.I would have welcomed 15 minutes cut from the film. While all of the many plots (deviously set up by The Joker) are fine, some went on just a few minutes too long. Otherwise, don't hesitate to see this. While the audience I was with was mostly male, 18-50 years of age, the issues it raises are worth the price of admission for anyone. However, the level of violence (some of it implied) would make me leave the kids (13 and under) at home. This is a worthy sequel to \"Batman Begins.\"",

    "reviewTitle": "Bob Kane would be so proud!",
    "reviewBody": "this masterpiece was so much more than a batman film, it was clearly one of the best 'crime-thriller-action- drama' epics. One of the movies in my list of \"best in the last 5-10 years.\" Far and away the best comic book movie ever made. Heath Ledger was awe inspiring as the maniacal, psychopath Joker. If you ever wanted to know how the joker was suppose to be played, watching Ledger is basically a character study on how it's done. That character is crazed and demented but at the same time he will get you to laugh at the things he is doing. Ledger was everything I could ever want out of the joker and Jack Nicholson's performance NOW seems more like a Ceasar Romero Joker of the 1960s. Aaron Eckhart was just as good as Harvey Dent /Two Face, his transformation from one to the next was so well done. Christian Bale was once again spot on as the Caped Crusader. I loved every part of this cinema masterpiece, there was nothing really flawed about it, everyone was on their A game, and that puts it among my all time favorites. One for the ages! Bob Kane would be so proud!!",

    "reviewTitle": "The Joker : An Oscarworthy Performance, nothing less and a truly great Batman franchise unfolding.",
    "reviewBody": "Boy, this only gets better and better! First of all, let's NOT compare 'The Dark Knight' to the excellent 'Batman Begins'. 'Begins' was just the Beginning, a prequel and never was something different than 'Knight' in a way so as to draw comparisons. It is a continuous process. This, the second of the 'Batman' franchise comes from the acclaimed director Christopher Nolan unleashing now with it the actual foresight and vision the director must have had in 2005 as to how a batman should be when his 'Begins' hit the theaters. The director took and used his time resourcefully in 'Begins' to build a crescendo right from the base, to explore what The Batman in fact was.In this movie, as a supporting actor Gyllenhaal provided the emotional factor to the plot effectively. Morgan Freeman, a seasoned veteran, exactly knows what he has to deliver in a Batman movie in a very short time. As in 'Begins', here too, he has delivered a crispy witty performance. The other Oscar winner, Caine, was heart-warming as the butler Alfred to provide moral support/guidance to Bat/Bruce, of course, with his own one-liners. Eckhart was brilliant in his acting as an honest, crime fighting District Attorney but the transformation from a DA to a Two Face was amazingly performed. Compared to him, the Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face was a joke. Oscar winner Jones too was capable of doing a much better job than he actually did but they never allowed him to. Tragedy is what Two-Face should depict and Eckhart did that successfully. Gary Oldman has done really well to play a character hanging delicately between his allies and enemies.The cinematography was outstanding. The camera angles made me feel like I was flying with the Batman. The background scores by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Lion King, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code) and Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) were simply haunting right from the beginning till the end never losing the pace... just like the storyline. The editing was crisp. The action was terrific. The dialogs were simply superb. Bale's was a well-balanced performance. What we are looking for is a well trained, well educated, scientific-minded, have-seen-it-all-type, Ninja in a Batman movie with emotions under control. So all is well with Bale, The Perfect Batman, the perfect Playboy.And now, to the real 'Jewel' of the movie: Heath Ledger. With all due respect to Jack Nicholson, the three time Oscar Winner, he has finally been outclassed by Ledger in playing the role of this particular deadly, psychopathic, psychotic, ego maniacal, sinister, unconscionable, egregious character of one of the biggest adversaries of Batman known to Batman fans: The Chaos-spreading Joker which Nicholson never was, if the aforementioned qualities are compared. This is the Mind-Chilling-Man-Killing-Lip-Smacking-Smiling Joker we, as Batman fans, have known, read about and imagined. Nicholson has lost the race here to Heath Ledger. The previous franchise really was a comic book franchise ...literally. If they really wanted to make a serious real life metaphor of a comic book, they would have, but they didn't. Otherwise Nicholson could have also been chilling too. But this franchise is injecting Batman and his adversaries into Real Life and vice versa. Just like what The Joker in this movie says: \"This town deserves a better class of criminal... and I'm going to give it to them.\" And truly Ledger has given it to us. Ledger has simply put astonishing life and sadistic energy in The Joker. The Joker here in this movie is like a nightmare come true. I always used to say: nothing gets more chilling or colder than Barry Foster in 'Frenzy (1972)', Anthony Hopkins in 'Silence of the Lambs 1991)', Kevin Spacey in 'SE7EN (1995)', Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List (1993)'. But here we can add one more chilling role to the league of the best 'cold-hearted' roles executed ever. Ledger has NOW truly put The Joker in the pantheon of the greatest movie villains ever. Watching this performance alone we can easily judge that Ledger, who died so young could easily have become Oscar material if he had lived. He can still win it as the Best Actor for this role posthumously though because his performance here is demanding one.This also is one of the Best Sequels Ever along with: Godfather II (1974), Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park 3(1999), Lord Of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), Lord Of the Rings: The Return Of The King (2003), Matrix Reloaded (2003), Mission Impossible 3 (NOT 2), The Jason Bourne Series, The Da Vinci Code (2006) - DVC is a sequel to Ron Howard's forthcoming Angels and Demons (2009). Not only is this the Best Batman movie, this is The Best Superhero movie and one of the best masterpieces ever made. Truly deserves many Oscars with at least the Best Actor's. If crime based 'The Departed' can be the Best Picture (because Raging Bull, Taxi Driver were better) than this definitely can also be. The previous franchise was literally comic, made for children. This franchise is dark and deep, made for teenagers / adults. And that is what a realistic Bat-Series meant to be. Based in the REAL world. By that, it does not mean Batman is for real. But he is in a world where rules of Physics hold true and are not distorted. Two more Batman movies from this franchise and this one will wipe out the ill-effects of the previous franchise ... completely.Just like The Joker says to Batman: \"You've changed things forever. There's no going back.\" This franchise has changed things forever. There's no going back.And yes, Long Live Ledger (in our hearts). By the way, I was amazed at The Joker's Pencil Disappearing (sick) Trick. Don't Ever Try That At Home. This movie gets a perfect 10 on 10.",

The joker was a very fun character in the movie. The batman was fun as well and didn't disappoint. Heath Ledger should definitely win an Oscar for the role he played. He did an amazing job playing the joker. It is very surprising but he might of been the best yet. It was very unpredictable which was nice. The end was very different and will definitely keep you guessing. It kept getting better and better. This will definitely be the best movie of the summer and maybe whole year. Maggie Gylenhaal did a good job but nothing special. Harvey dents character brought a lot to this movie. The visuals were amazing throughout. The places the batman and joker went were very cool. There were many scenes that were original and different. The messages were great as well and had good heart in it. Honestly after the movie is over it will leave you happy ans shocked. This was an instant classic. A masterpiece in every way possible. This movie should go up for many different Oscars. The acting, best movie of the year, and costume designing was great. It was well worth your money and time. Some people think it was to long but was just perfect. Overall this was one of the funnest movies in a long time.",

It is a crime saga, it is brilliant, it contains one of the best villain performances ever in a movie (yes, Mr. Ledger really is that good), and overall it shows what happens when a bunch of dedicated film makers come together and make a film.Every other summer movie that comes out/came out in 2008 is/was crap compared to this. It was funny to me that they were showing a preview for the next Mummy movie...it seems so ridiculous that two such movies could exist in the same world.I don't mean to use this review to bash on other movies, but it really delightful to see such an amazing movie come out of Hollywood. On the other side of the coin, it is annoying that other films' makers just don't care as much.Christopher Nolan is a genius, every actor in this movie ranges from good to astounding, every explosion looks real, action shots are stunning, and as I have already said, The Joker is breathtaking.10/10, this movie is a crime masterpiece, the best comic book movie ever made, and one of the best films to ever have come out during the months of May-August.",

    "reviewTitle": "Dark Knight shines bright!!!",
    "reviewBody": "After sitting in the darkest, dirtiest slums of Gotham City for a little over two and a half hours straight, I still didn't want to go home. \"The Dark Knight\" was brilliant in every way. Although this is the darkest superhero movie to date, the incredible vision of Director Christopher Nolan, the captivating action sequences, the philosophical themes, and the pitch-perfect performances delivered by every member of the all-star ensemble made \"The Dark Knight\" shine bright, especially, of course, the darkest performance of them all, The Joker, brilliantly played by the late Heath Ledger.Heath has just been showered with enthusiastic reviews since the early screenings. You can't help but wonder how good Heath can possibly be. After watching the screening on Wednesday, trust me, Heath is so good it's scary. You hold your breath in absolute awe with every scene he enters, and linger on his every word. You laugh along because he's hilarious, but deep down inside you are terrified. The Joker gets so deep into your psyche you find yourself rooting for the lunatic, and wondering why.Thank God Christian Bale as Batman is just as likable and just as ruthless, and we're all relieved that we still have a reason to root for the good guy. Once you get past the phony raspy voice Batman must feign to conceal his identity, you will begin to appreciate Christian Bale as the most complicated Bruce Wayne to date, faced with serious cerebral issues, whether he's struggling to find out what's best for the city, what do about his love for Rachel Dawes, and what the heck is going on in the Joker's crazy cranium.At some point in the movie, every character is faced with a seemingly simple, yet ultimately difficult decision, what's right and what's wrong. For someone like Harvey Dent, perfectly executed by Aaron Eckhart, everything can be made right. For the Joker, the whole world is wrong. Throughout the entire course of the movie, the line between right and wrong gets thinner and thinner, and what ensues is complete mayhem.\"The Dark Knight\" is a total package. You get an adrenaline-pumping action flick, a suspenseful crime drama, an emotional love triangle, the perfect amount of comedy, and a complete work of art. Round of applause once again for all the performances. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are just naturally likable actors. Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal continue to impress again and again. And yes, the crowd was applauding when Tiny Lister made his appearance (aka Deebo for \"Friday\" fans and Zeus for wrestling fanatics). And sigh, Heath Ledger.Jack Nicholson's Joker had a line that haunted me as I grew up watching Tim Burton's film: \"You ever dance with the devil under the pale moon light?\" The new Joker introduces a new question to torment the ages: \"Why so serious?\" The eerie monologue that introduces this creepy quote is sure to leave a lasting imprint in the back of your mind for years. And Heath Ledger delivers a haunting performance that will join the ranks of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal and Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, and will go down as one of the greatest villains, if not the best, ever depicted in the history of film.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Darkest Knight",
    "reviewBody": "I have just returned from one of the most pivotal, exciting, edge-of-my-seat movie-going experiences I have ever had the pleasure and thrill of attending.This film is by a very colossal margin the most impressive achievement in film making i have seen this year. Perhaps taking on the sole role of Summer Blockbuster, THE DARK KNIGHT: in its length of nearly 3 hours, is jam packed with Popcorn perfect action, jaw-dropping special effects, and perhaps the most complex, twisted, and purely sadistic persona ever captured on film.Immediately, and I mean immediately, the film opens with action, comedy and thrill, and for the next 152 minutes, never lets go for a chance to breathe, because quite frankly, there is no room for it in this film that, somehow, builds endlessly like a tightrope and just keeps going, and going, and going until its explosive, emotional climax, and then it keeps going, and going, and going until its unexpected, bittersweet conclusion.Very rich in the special effects department, this film uses many elements that are simply real: props, lighting, pyro, and fake elements, using CGI only when absolutely necessary, and it blends in simply beautifully. Because of the film's scale, which stretches halfway around the world, along with the seemingly larger-than-life occurrences that are pulled off perfectly, this film just looks real. The realism in the personal elements, along with the violence and technology strewn throughout the epic film, adds only more to the film's sense of it happening right there in front of you. The people in this film aren't just pawns anymore, they are entangled into a complex conundrum of the difference between what is right, and what is fair, a concept deliberated between the so-called Light knight: Harvey Dent, and the caped crusader himself throughout the entire film up unto its final, grindingly suspenseful moment.Of course, this personal review would be shamed and incomplete without an analysis on Heath Ledger's jaw dropping, smile-inducing, shock provoking, and mind-bending performance as the twisted, sadistic Joker. From the first moment we set eyes on that wretched, nasty face of his, we are clinched in his grasp until the film's end. We are NEVER sure or aware of when he will show his painted face as the film progresses, and sometimes, or should i say no times, is it met with any warning or preparation. You feel almost unsafe in your own theatre, because you are simply out of control, as the viewer it has become impossible to dictate his actions and watch them with little more than a sense of a spectator or distant observer. No, you are wrenched in and held down to view his role with every twisted development. Also, a special hats off to the film's music department, headed by James Newton Howard. The Joker's theme is so ear-bending and insanity-ridden, but also excruciatingly simple and low-key, that every time you hear it, you are frightened, scared and uncomfortable because it is always accompanying a scene fit for its madness. When you hear it, you will know. Heath Ledger's performance covers a spectrum so complete and complex that you almost are lost within it at times. He, like his name implies, is actually quite rarely joking, comical or cynical in his dealings, even though he commonly refers to it as his game. This film is really the first batman piece to really analyze the irony and metaphorical complexities in his title. That really, he isn't joking, he isn't out for a laugh so much as a sheer, sadistic thrill from seeing chaos ensue around him, and he gets this until he laughs that teeth-grinding laugh that just beckons for more. He is unhesitant, uncaring, and sly to a fine point in his dealings that seem to somehow work their way into the minds of Gotham's police department, and hopefully the batman as well, for as he says, his world has no rules, but Batman has only his one, and the testing of Batman's rule pushes him into the ultimate internal and external battle he can face. And as an audience member, after it is all said and done, ask yourself if you would have used the same methods against the joker's heartless workings into your soul. The premise that film takes on really does grab you by the throat and force you to think, either then or later. Which is perhaps the main reason i loved this film.THE DARK KNIGHT is a spectacle, it is a summer thriller, it is a romantic struggle, and a pure psychological playground. Go prepared.11/10",

    "reviewTitle": "Give Heath the Oscar already!",
    "reviewBody": "This is one of the few sequels that joins that rare pantheon of film which surpasses the original. Terminator 2, Aliens and The Godfather II come to mind. TDK joins that illustrious rank.Christian Bale IS Batman. No other actor before him has been able to portray the character as he has been able to. Not to mention he does an excellent job with the playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne.Gary Oldman has a great supporting role as Batman's only ally. Aron Eckhart is also good as Dent, but I felt the FX for Two-Face did not fit in with the realistic vision Nolan created. But only a minor complaint.Finally, Heath Ledger. HE IS THE JOKER!!!! The mannerisms, the inflections in his face, his walk, his talk, his look, his dialogs. Everything is perfect. Every detail has been studied by Ledger to create one of the most terrifying villains to ever grace the screen. Without a doubt, Heath will posthumously win the Oscar for best supporting actor. Without him this movie cannot be elevated to the great sequels of all time.I just hope that the inevitable third film can live up to this amazing sequel. Nolan will have to work extremely hard to top this magnificent film.",

    "reviewTitle": "To call it the best Superhero film ever made is an understatement!",
    "reviewBody": "So, went to a midnight screening, and I have to tell you, watching The Dark Knight I did not know what to expect because of all the hype. Well, I do not know what expectations people had, but for me, it exceeded what I wanted it to do, and more!To call this a superhero film only is a bit of an understatement, actually, it is a lot. It plays out like a crime film. More than i thought it would too. Without knowing it was rated PG-13, I wouldn't know it was. It has the tone and feel of a Rated R film, films like The Departed, No country for Old Men, and Seven. After watching Batman Begins about a year ago, it really is different. The Dark Knight doesn't feel like the first, nor does it feel like any other superhero film ever made. I will say this, though, do not worry about expectations when you watch it. You really do not have time to be thinking about it, and if you are, it means the film is not keeping your interest. Well, watching The Dark knight was probably the most thrilling, enjoyable, and amazing experience I have ever had in a theater. The fans all in line, and also when the film started, all throughout, we were all blown away. There were claps and cheers, there were whistling( a bit annoying) but it was all root for the film. The film entertained, not just with some of the best action sequences ever, but with it's amazing script. It is very powerful, more powerful than some of the Oscar films last year. I think the Academy should take this amazing script into consideration. The acting by everyone was top-notch. But of course, the one that steals the show is Heath Ledger. Does Ledger deserve all the Oscar buzz? All the hype? With a very 'un-fanboyish' answer, freakin yes!!! Heath Ledger accomplished something amazing. I cannot really compare his acting, character he created, with any I have ever seen(unlike many critics). Yes, he has a bit of Hannibal Lector, but with all respect, what he did in this film is beyond what Anthony Hopkins accomplished in The Silence of the Lambs. He goes really deep into the character, so deep that in ever scene he is in, you cannot help but imagine what the actor was thinking, how he was reacting, to all his lines and scenes. I think Ledger, even if he was alive, would have received this buzz. Surprisingly, it was not over-the-top like I thought it would be. He doesn't overreact, he just 'is'. The action in this film, unlike the first one, is literally amazing! It is very much stunts, and the reason the action works is because of how the script builds it up.Overall, I cannot say if this film will exceed all expectations. Many fans have a lot of anticipation, and expect a full-blown masterpiece. I have seen amazing, great, even perfect films, but only a few can be called masterpieces. Is this a masterpiece? Well, not really, at least not by everyone. Some will say it missed that mark, some will say it is... The thing with this film is that it's trying to be an amazing, flawless deep superhero film. It is very ambitious(yes, overused word, but its the truth) and it aims for that goal, and in a lot of stages, like writing, direction, entertainment, complexity, darkness, it is somewhere a hidden masterpiece. It is not the second-coming like fanboys call it, but it is near one in a way. Never has a blockbuster achieved so many things at once, and never has it reached this lever of deepness(that Batman Begins TRIED to reach) and in that way, yes, maybe it is a masterpiece, only time will tell though. But, even though it is not flawless, it really is an amazing film, by any means, and not just the best superhero film ever made by far, but also the most thought-provoking film in years that I have seen, and will stand among some of the best 'epic, big blockbusters' of all time. It certainly deserves too. Now, on to the Oscars, The Academy should not snub this film in a lot of categories.... Best Director for Christopher Nolan is deserved...",

    "reviewBody": "This movie is one hell of a journey!The story is right out of Jack Kirby pages and combines all kind of tones (serious, sad, funny). The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealisticly good. Hela is one of the best MCU villains so far! Cate Blanchett just killing it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous \"Thor\" movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the \"Revengers\" team, such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome.The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three \"Thor\" movies. Firstly. because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly it's also one of the best MCU movies.Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard Marvel fan, I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela is epic, Odin got his significant role and there are some Huge connections that'll lead to \"Infinity War\" and you'll lose your mind when you see them.MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!",

The last trailer of the movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of my life by watching it.Hela,Valkyrie,Hulk,Thor,Loki,Grandmaster they all did pretty good job.Especially Hela.She was so gorgeous and menacing at the same time.

Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Hela and Fenrir as Loki's children??Loki is already a well established and grounded character.At this point,I don't think any director/writer could change Loki's past and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Loki's kids cause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.For the sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the Norse Myth and in the comics.The performances of the main cast are impressive and exceptional.This movie also showed us the real \"God of Thunder\".For the first time he was extremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming all over his body was pure awesomeness.This movie is mostly targeted for everybody except for joyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have a boring,dull life. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda remind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics were praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this movie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which was perfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all big,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So glad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The best version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear some people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't look like Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I care about is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track record since 2008.Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel is always using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if they fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies for the past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create the highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players like Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.",

    "reviewBody": "\"Fun\" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means \"not art\" or \"lacking drama.\" And the word \"funny\" likewise doesn't negate artistic integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great filmmaking or \"true art\" simply doesn't know what they're talking about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor, comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art and expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedy and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than straightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun and comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add levity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I even need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrow personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing corporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking -- turning everything into \"us versus them,\" but the extent to which it's devolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or isn't \"art,\" is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of so much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre storytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it is also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and it is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up",

    "reviewTitle": "Ragnawhok ??",
    "reviewBody": "Starting from the basics.What does the title mean?From Wikipedia: In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. the fact that our film and characters are quite literally the same as those mentioned in the Norse mythology one would hope to see such cataclysmic disasters of monumental proportions on screen from \"The House of idea\" right? WRONG!! Well our characters have either gone fully insane or the performers were bound by contracts and buried under the pile of of cash that they didn't tried to borrow or adapt anything remotely from the source and that spelled Ragnarok (ironic in this case) for the film. The performances are trite and pathetic except for Hemsworth who showcases his natural talent of comic relief. He has proved time and again that he has the talent for what it takes to be a powerhouse and his boastful resume speaks of Rush,Thor, In the Heart of Sea, etc. But sadly the \"GOD of Thunder\" has been reduced to a self aware parody that only leads to ennui for the audience.This feels more like what the \"GOD of blunder\" would do.Mind you, this film is mostly targeted for children and teenage audience so humor, colorful C.G.I scenery which are glaringly obvious and plainly distracting in some cases in the film and retro infused soundtracks are enough on the platter to cater to them. Hulk's character is forced in the film as he doesn't feel natural midst all the chaos. Even his motion capture looks cheap as low budget corny effects.his struggling with his humanity and monstrosity sides has been sidelined and likely won't be addressed further as his presence in ANY film is just to have a bruiser to smash.Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie looks NOTHING like her comic counterpart since she should have been a tall musclebound warrior with sinewy physique not some glamour model walking the catwalk cos-playing her new Walmart sale. ODIN the all-father, one of the most powerful characters is conveniently sidestepped so as to circumvent his true potential like taking head on with Galactus the \"Devourer of Worlds\", taking a full on brunt from Silver surfer and Thanos and acting like nothing ever happened. But sadly Anthony Hopkins looks tired and bored to continue and even expressed disappointment regarding this very fact not once but twice!!Then why bother casting him in the first place??All in all a \"seen it all before\" repeating formulaic garbage from MCU. i don't understand how the director said in the first place this will be darker than all previous THOR movies. did i mention Karl urban was in it? Yes he was as forgettable as his character was that of a mindless grunt henchmen of Hela. No personality or development just boom boom pow.",

    "reviewBody": "I will not give away any spoilers or anything, just will give my impression of the movie. The movie is definitely entertaining, the main and supporting cast are doing well. Tone wise movie is far too light for what Ragnarok stands for. And you never really worry for any of the main cast, at least I did not. The feeling was similar to watching a cartoon - colors, action, dialogues not too heavy on the words, moments of build up and joy, moments of emptiness. Movie earns a 7/10 and a solid one. Now for the rant: Can IMDb stop letting accounts with less than 1 week after registration period post reviews? First review I've read, prior to writing my own, was a Bulgarian guy giving movie a 10/10 (movie has flaws). Guy has no other ratings, review or anything. Accounts is 2 days old. So I decided to check other 10/10 reviews - all fresh accounts, made on the day of the premier or just now. Isn't this suspicious? The ratings can also go both ways. Just I don't want any of fake publicity shadow other people's opinions, including my own. I am more than sure no one watched this movie and said to himself/herself \"Hey, I must go on IMDb, make an account and review this!\". This is not that kind of movie, you will get same emotions as you've received from the trailer, to put it short. Nothing special :D",

    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett, who are rarely seen having so much fun. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard. Overall, the film benefits from its director's distinct style and measured irreverence, giving Thor a welcome boost of vitality.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game",
    "reviewBody": "Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date.As said in my review for 'The Death of Stalin', 2017 has been very hit and miss for films, the best ones being wonderful (I.e. 'God's Own Country', 'The Farthest', 'The Death of Stalin', 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Wind River', 'IT', 'The LEGO Batman Movie') and the worst ones being dreadful (i.e. 'Baywatch', 'The Snowman', 'The Emoji Movie', 'Stratton', 'Flatliners', 'The Mummy', 'Transformers: The Last Knight'). 'Thor: Ragnarok' is to me up there with the year's best. Would even go as far to say that it's one of the best and most entertaining \"superhero\" films so far, whether in Marvel, DCU or anywhere.On a visual level, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best-looking of the three 'Thor' films and of Marvel in general. Asgard looks colourful and atmospheric. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations are stunningly vivid. The special effects and stunts are not just dazzling and have substance and purpose rather than just being thrown in for the sake of it, they are among the best of any Marvel film. Just for the record, Marvel get a lot of hate, particularly in the ridiculous and blown completely out of proportion DCU vs Marvel war, have personally enjoyed a lot many of their efforts. The music pulsates thrillingly and is also catchy and rich in atmosphere and emotion.'Thor: Ragnarok', as said, is a contender for Marvel's funniest film. The dialogue crackles in wit and deadpan deliciousness, and absolutely loved Thor's quips and the clever in-jokes (Loki's horrified reaction at coming face to face with Hulk was a standout). They are all placed adeptly, placement is never questionable.It's not just about the humour that makes 'Thor: Ragnarok' so great though. Like 'Thor: The Dark World' in particular of the previous two films, the action is absolutely thrilling and breath-taking in spectacle (almost 'The Lord of the Rings'-like in scale). There is plenty of bold dark-natured tension and the emotional moments give the film a lot of heart and are genuinely moving.Taika Waititi balances humour, action and drama with ease and it shows in the compelling and tightly structured and paced story. The characters are even more expansive in development, both intrigue and entertain and their well fleshed out personalities make them easy to care for them. Thor and Loki are beautifully realised characters while Hulk is the most interesting he's been in a long time. Hela is not just the best non-Loki 'Thor' villain (so much better than the one-dimensional and underwritten villain of 'The Dark World) but also one of the best villains in the Marvel canon, not just posing a threat, interesting in personality and having a motivation that nobody will scoff at but she is also one of few Marvel villains to actually have an arc. Korg (with Waititi writing himself in to portray) is a bit random but is a lot of fun.Chris Hemsworth is at his most relaxed and charismatic, while Tom Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. Anthony Hopkins continues to bring welcome gravitas to Odin and doesn't ham up. Cate Blanchett relishes the character of Hela, and makes her a character that's menacing, entertaining and oddly rootable.Mark Ruffalo is a strong presence as Hulk, Benedict Cumberbatch brings everything that was good about his Dr Strange in the first place and Jeff Goldblum is suitably playful. Karl Urban comes off least but does his best with the relatively little he has (which to me was nowhere near distracting enough to bring the film down).Overall, a brilliant film with Thor and Marvel being at the top of their game. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

    "reviewBody": "Another win for Marvel. Phase three shows no signs of slowing down. The movies itself is a great stand alone film, but also does its part for the wider MCU. Thor has evolved from the serious, god-like character we knew after spending some years on Earth. His new found humor fits well without throwing away the development that has occurs in previous appearances. The dynamic between Thor and Loki continues to flourish; the latter remains a key factor into the franchise success. Hulk/Banner gets enough screen time to warrant a spot in the title. No one will ever tire of seeing Hulk smash on a scale as large as this. Stand out performance from Valkyrie. Excellent portrayal of a lesser-known character that shall no longer be lesser-known. Grandmaster goes full Goldblum. That should be enough to sell you on that character. Hela does not fit the mold of weak antagonist roles from past Marvel movies. Too powerful to disregard with motives to back her actions. Epic actions scenes on a larger than life scale. Worth a watch in IMAX. Some overuse of comedy but it's what you come to expect from a blockbuster appealing to the masses. Not once does it distract you from the threat at hand. A nice set up for Infinity War without seeming like a prequel. 9/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Bring The Thunder",
    "reviewBody": "This review of Thor: Ragnarok is spoiler free**** (4/5)LIKE CHANTING BETELGUISE'S name, for Marvel products the phrase third time's a charm really works, of course well-earned nods to brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo's Captain America: Civil War which accomplished all fears for its enchanting, eye-shattering Leipzig airport battle scene having the heroes involved showing what they can do, the standout there was Black Panther and the introduction of the newer, younger much improved Spider-Man. Then we had Shane Black's turn at Iron Man 3 which vastly improved on its predecessor. Now the third and final entry in the Thor series is one of the most ridiculous, most hilarious adventures Marvel has ever produced, it's essentially like eating a badger sandwich, and no we don't know what that is either. This daftness comes from none other than New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi, who over the last few years has created some of the most bizarre adventures ever told in cinema with his hilarious vampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows and secondly Hunt For The Wilderpeople which had a stunning performance from Sam Neill in a hat made from a collinder. However Thor: Ragnarok is his most ridiculous adventure yet.After Chris Hemsworth's Thor is hurled from the bifrost he's captured on a strange planet which from first glance is obviously the universe's trash can, under the rule of Jeff Goldblum's daft, yet tyrannical Grandmaster who looks like he just wears anything he finds in the 80s factory complete with a blue line under his lip and comes with a lot of Goldbluminess, he's funny as hell - he gives Thor the ultimate fight against his champion - Hulk's (Mark Ruffalo) welcome is really no surprise but comes with a roundhouse of applause particularly with the well-drawn hand-to-hand combat in a Star Wars-esque gladiatorial coliseum which can't escape Thor's scream of joy and a few quick-witted jokes to get you going. Meanwhile on the other side of the universe the Asghardians are held for a fight for their survival after a vicious attack from Cate Blanchett's goddess of death Hela looking a tad like Alice Cooper's twisted sister complete with a horned helmet for ferocity. Sadly her performance is the film's weakest point, she doesn't exactly come with Galadriel's strength or depth she's not Marvel's best villain, though a better improvement over Thor: The Dark World's Dark Elves. She's not in many scenes and when she does appear her delivery is often heavy-handed and empty with little feeling.The script penned by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost is an improvement over the previous instalment too - the funnier scenes are along the same lines as James Gunn's unadulterated joy for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, here there are arse gags and penis gags aplenty which is a vast improvement over the previous two films' barrier for serious face the actors are allowed to let loose here. Particularly the shared chemistry between Thor who hates having his hair cut, Hulk angry as ever and Tessa Thompson's surly Valkyrie who can't stop drinking yet comes with a humanizing story giving her performance some emotion. Yet there's humour to them too they each share their time with the whims and the jokes that the script has to offer, the three arguing in a room with an angry Hulk and a teamed final fight are obvious standouts. Sadly, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't come without its flaws it's not utterly thunderous throughout the last few minutes of the final fight are a little CG heavy there's a lot going on in a few shots it can be difficult to follow a certain point which watching in 3D can be on occasion daunting to the eyes. Though there is some goodness the CG images on show, here the destruction of Asghard though upsetting for the fans who have stayed with the series is thoroughly stunning plus this is the most impressive vision of Hulk yet, he's still a wonder to watch from the outrageous gladiatorial combat, through the hilarious jokes he lets free to the film's final fight he's relentless and utterly charming. This is vintage Waititi he is clearly at home here in the huge immersive worlds of space or the cramped space of Hulk's chamber he allows you to breathe with the world he has created here. The finale of the Thor series is one of the most intense, boldest adventures Marvel has ever created does it bring on the thunder? You're damn right it does.VERDICT Daft, ridiculous and hilarious Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour and goofball madness in this neon-infused 80s style finale.",

I was in stitches for most of the film, as was the rest of the cinema audience. The character 'Korg' is a sensationally funny character and one to look out for; those one liners are amazing. Truly a great movie with excellent content, and overshadows both previous movies. I'd you don't see this movie, you will really be missing out! Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much content the Hulk had. He wasn't just a side character for this movie which I expected",

    "reviewBody": "The film is well made, good CGI, and it is very entertaining....lots of action and humour. However, the plot is very basic, it is very predictable, and lacks tension and emotional engagement (probably due to the almost constant humorous dialogue and gags). My biggest concern is that the humour has gone too far, to the extent that the characters bear very little resemblance to previous films. If you're just after a entertaining film, with good humour and action, this should work for you. If you want the Marvel world that you've seen in previous films, with Thor and Hulk in character, then this isn't it. A formula that's working with Guardians and Deadpool, doesn't have to be imposed in characters in this franchise, there was enough humour in the previous films, but this goes too far in my opinion, as I was hoping to see the same characters as in the previous films.",

    "reviewBody": "I don't get all the 10 star reviews, did these people ever read the comics and know the characters? As it does not add up if they did! Actors were good, so good casting, but the story is awful, it's a mish-mash of at least five different good stories from people who knew how to write good comics back in the day. The characters, are not as they should be for some reason, I guess the Hollywood writers had a basic bio of the characters, and then just wrote whatever pleased them without doing any research. The comedy is throughout, why is there so much I don't know, if I want comedy, I'll watch the carry on films. Really gutted, Marvel Studios obviously and unfortunately can't do serious anymore, it almost feels like a mockery. Don't waste your time with the end credit scene, totally a waste of time. Give me Watchmen any day of the week over this, although I'll confess it was an improvement on the last Thor film. Please Marvel Studios, get a proper writing team and give up on this average cramped up stories you're giving us!A wise man once said, Nuff Said!",

    "reviewTitle": "incoherent mess that doesn't understand what Ragnarok mean's",
    "reviewBody": "Likes : I'm sorry if you're looking for the bandwagon ten star review here you're better off look at a marvel fanboy review, because here you're getting an honest and straight to the point review on this film.Now i'm not gonna complete trash this film as there we're moment in this film that we're funny but sadly not many moment, the action scene including the the fight between \"Thor\" and the \"Hulk\" we're good in areas but had one major flaw with this scene which i will explain in dislikes.The main character that stood out more was Cate Blanchett playing Hela (the goddess of death), my god did she play this with perfection as she carves her way through Asgard solider with easy she is a force to be reckon with. Cate clearly was perfect casting for this role with a very sexy look in a dark way and very charismatic villain in having one purpose to destroy and control.Tessa Thompson didn't do a bad job with her role as a \"Valkyrie\" which we go a slight back story of why she no longer with Asgard, she does add a little bit humor to the film, with Karl Urban character not sure where the writer of this film were going with this character but seem a bit of a waste as he wasn't really doing much though the film. Benedict Cumberbatch playing Dr strange in the film as a cameo like iron man but shorter scene was a little funny in places but a little over the top, Jeff Goldblum playing the grand master one of the ageless Elders of the Universe and has mastered most civilizations' games of skill and chance, did OK with this role you could see he had fun with this role.Mark Ruffalo Hulk is a little different in this film as the look and manor of the character has changes but still the same hulk, there a few jokes though around about the other avengers, Chris Hemsworth put in a OK performance and did offer some funny moments though the film as well as the bad ass look with the lighting around him which gave the character a better flare.Although this film is entertaining in areas and some of the visual effect we're good, sadly this film was full of flaws that makes it a mess.Dislikes : The visual effect in this film throughout most scene felt like an amateur had done it on a cheap PC, even from the scene which is in the trailer when Hela smashed the hammer was bad. This scene of where they are before this event happens look seriously bad, specially when they are looking out at the sea you could see that this scene is in front of them is a Green screen. This just made the scene so fake it almost take's you out of the moment they are trying to portray and clearly from the trailer the alleyway scene was so much better, it's looked like they swap the ally-way scene for a cheap look visual effect cliff-side which they should of kept with the ally-way it would have looked better.The concept alone was a complete mess even for a marvel film, i know a lot of fans will say he just a Dc fanboy marvel hater but i'm not saying this for the sake of trashing this film it really is that bad from a critic stand point.The film doesn't know what it trying to be iver a comedy or serious it just come off so bad it pull the film even some of the joke and humor fall flat which is bad for comedy, some of them feel completely forced at time to make it funny. Sadly the only funny part in the whole film was Thor with a bowling ball, that one scene was the only time i hear the audience laugh because that was funny.It like the Director or writers have forgotten what Ragnarok actually mean's and they've try to make a comedic film with a serious tone (sorry but this just doesn't work in a film), specially a film with Cate Blanchett character who's very tone is very dark, this should've been a lot more serious, darker and the humor less maybe this would've work for the story alone. Instead we get this incoherent mess with music that doesn't even fit the film what so ever with bad jokes and over use of the word like a child would do using the word Ass several times, sorry but Thor 3 Ragnarok is by far the 2nd worst movie marvel has done even though it was entertaining. P.S There two end credit scenes but the very end credit scene wasn't even worth staying behind to see after the credit rolled, it was a waste of time even adding it as it was nothing to do with Infinity war.",

Ragnarok basically throws in all the great stuff from the Thor comics that haven't been used yet, pays lip service to them, and then makes a mockery of the whole thing. Hulk fighting Thor? Has no impact because it's all so comedic. It's just empty spectacle. The whole movie is like that.So much here is wasted. Heimdall (Idris Elba looks like he didn't even want to be there). Cate Blanchett. Odin. Skurge. The Fenris Wolf. Surtur. Planet Hulk. The whole Ragnarok myth is reduced to not very much. All sacrificed at the alter of constant, silly gags.If you want some dumb, silly, spectacular entertainment, it's passable, but Thor: Ragnarok is a terrible waste of potential and great source material.",

This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films like the LOTR trilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians of the Galaxy . Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As well as the Stone revolutionary South African gladiator . Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role for Scarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble . As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about the franchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk ) mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by an excellent script and great comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Banner and Valkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performance was below par for such an excellent actor . Plenty of action and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .It's a film I'd definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the reclining seats :) Pad.A 9/10",

The concept is one of the best you can see in superhero movies.They balanced the humor and seriousness perfectly.There were also brutal moments which will surprise you.Especially the 3rd act is pretty brutal.I heard the laughter of audience almost on every funny moment of the movie. I never thought a Thor movie would have an awesome soundtrack.I can tell that it really gives you the Guardians of the Galaxy 1 vibes.

I also liked the female characters in this one, both very bad ass fighters, no unnecessary romantic entanglement as the previous works. (I mean, it's not about Jane herself, she's fine, but was written in a way that doesn't really fit in or helpful to the plot.)btw I watched it in BFI IMAX. It was such an experience!

    "reviewTitle": "Now THAT'S how you make a Thor film!!",
    "reviewBody": "Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were among the weaker installments. They took them a little too seriously and they were a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction though. The humour throughout is pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of the motion picture. The lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friends is a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than being bogged down with Thor's forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from the previous two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the forefront as Hela, the villain of the piece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time of her life portraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki must put aside their differences and try to stop her. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes their dynamic more enjoyable.They end up getting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playing the Grandmaster (but really it's Goldblum playing himself) who forces Thor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gains the trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and from there, it's your classic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director, adding a lot of charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic is also great as well, a real '80s neon feel. And the music...the music was brilliant! Who would've thought that the composer for Rugrats would deliver such an awesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form for the God of Thunder!!!",

    "reviewBody": "In this Taika Waititi (Boy, What we do in the Shadows) directed film, written by Eric Pearson (Marvel One Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, Marvel One Shot: The Consultant), Craig Kyle (Ultimate Avengers, Hulk Vs.), Christopher Yost (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Wars: Rebels), based on comics by Stan Lee (Iron Man, Thor), Larry Lieber (Iron Man, Thor) and Jack Kirby (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron) and starring Chris Hemsworth (Rush, Ghostbusters) as Thor.After taking the crown from Surtur (Clancy Brown: The Shawshank Redemption, TVs Daredevil), he returns it to his homeland where Thor finds that his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston: Thor, TVs The Night Manager) has taken over Asgard and hidden Odin (Anthony Hopkins: Silence of the Lambs, Thor) on Earth, but upon his death, Hela (Cate Blanchett: The Lord of the Rings, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) God of Death and their powerful sister, comes to take the throne for herself. Thrown across the Universe, Thor is first captured by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson: Selma, TVs Westworld), sold to Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum: Jurassic Park, Independence Day) and held captive on the planet Sakaar where he and other warriors, including Korg (an inspired turn by director Taiki Waititi), are forced to fight for his entertainment. Ultimately Thor is pitted against The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo: Avengers Assemble, Now You See Me), but without his hammer, can Thor not only win his gladiatorial duel against his former Avenger friend but also convince and assemble a team (Hulk, Valkyrie and his untrustworthy brother) to stop Hela and prevent Ragnarok, the doom of the Asgarian civilisation? This action, adventure, comedy film hit all the right notes for me. The humour was spot on, right up my street (think Deadpool), and this and the action never felt forced. All the actors were on their A game and for me, a huge Loki fan, I have to admit that in his own small way, Korg stole the movie like Loki did in Thor. Not even the turn from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, TVs Sherlock) could beat it.I was pleased that Hela, the main villain, got her character arc as this has been lacking in some previous Marvel films and has for me left the baddies flat, and this time the epic fight scenes bookend the serious moments well. As perturbing as it was for a fan of the mythology for Hela and Fenrir to be used not as Loki's children, it worked for the film and Goldblum's wackiness gelled as well as Samuel L Jackson's bad guy Valentine in Kingsman. Yes it is awful when they summarily kill off some favourite characters, in some cases notably without even giving them a line, and concentrate more on Skurge (Karl Urban: Star Trek, The Bourne Supremacy) but here too they give him a meaningful character arc, he wants to be worthy and he gets his chance. Heimdall (Idris Elba: Prometheus, Pacific Rim) is busy trying to hide and save as many innocent Asgardians as he can while Hela searches for the sword that will help her start the apocalypse for other worlds. And though Banner worries that allowing himself to turn back into the Hulk may leave him that way forever, he too gets his emotional scenes when we see the cameo of Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson: We Bought a Zoo, Lucy) and his chance to shine against the terrifying Fenrir.The soundtrack is epic in its own right, up there with GOTG1, and the film does not feel like more of the same (as some of the superhero movies have sadly started feeling), it feels back to its best. If this is to be the last Thor movie, then they gave him a great one to bow out.Yes the movie had a few flaws (e.g. Thor has never wanted the power of ruling, Banner may stay as the Hulk), but as the best way to describe the film is pure fun, I am going to give it 10/10 despite these because that is just what most people need at the moment, joyous escapism.",

    "reviewBody": "Here it is, our God of Thunder is back after AoU.As many reviews said that this movie is light-humored movie, I can confirm that's true. However, for me, it didn't reduce much essence of the theme. It's well delivered. Other than this, I do very like the visualization and cinematographic, especially on bifrost fight. It beats GoTG for sure.Okay, the characters. FFS, Hela is OP. Thor didn't have any chance against her. She is unstoppable and cannot f-word die. She is goddess of death, after all. Maybe I can put her in the third position of strongest villain on MCU below big-purple man and Surtur. I didn't list Dormammu because we have not see his true strength.So, conclusion. Nearly cry tears for joy by seeing the original power of Thor, Valkyrie is awesome, Loki is still God of Mischief, Heimdall didn't have Soul Stone neither nor Hela, there is a character who totally change in Infinity War later, and we get a tiny glimpse on how Thor get stranded in Star Lord's ship in first post end credit scene.It's a 8.0 of 10",

    "reviewBody": "I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie, but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, there aren't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. The Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he's always been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It works though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always. Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the way Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardly any background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he's just a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss a little seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like most Marvel movies, the villains don't marvel.",

    "reviewBody": "As a fan of Thor, and Nordic Mythology, I'm pretty f***ed up. Yea, the CGI was powerful, thanks for that. But for the story? Cheesy And Too Shallow for a Nordic God Story. Please Marvel, put your jokes at the right place. For some entity like humans, let's said Spider-Man, Dead-Pool, it's okay for a full movies with jokes, it's natural, because they're human, they are average. But this? You just ruined all the Thor's character you build for many years. I was hoping for a cool CGI with cool story and cool fight, cause it's about Asgard, not a New Yorker boy who meet crazy rich genius. Once again, please, put your jokes with right portion and right place. You definitely fail on this. Too cheesy. This was my biggest disappointment as Marvel fans for as long as I can remember. You killed his attitude, you definitely killed Thor. You killed my fantasies since I was a child. I'm okay if you put all your very cheesy shallow jokes to those human characters. But this? Guardians of 9 realms? Like what? Like What are you guys thinking? It's just like you want to tell us that all of our lives is just a jokes like what they did?You totally cool for makes me out of this world with Ego Jokes at Guardians Of Galaxy, it hits me so hard like we're just nothing. But once again? Like really? Is that all of you want to tell us? Is that the hidden message? Well played dude.You put a comedy on a wrong place. And I was like definitely can know each and every step of your cheesy shallow jokes. Every single thing. It was not entertaining anymore. Too much and not a smart move, I never thought marvel would be as shallow as this. So shallow. Way more Shallow than The 40 Year Old Virgin or American Pie.You guys makes me bored. And if you keeping something like this for infinite wars, Please, just turn all of your smart cool brain into comedy shows. Makes a new production house, you definitely good at it. But please, Don't put any single superhero on it. I begging you.You missed to build all the mood of this story, even the super prankster Deadpool still have it's touchy feelings. For this? Zero. Minus.I put the ratings only for CGI, which doesn't amaze me since I've seen something like that at the guardians of galaxy. I expected more.And yeah, why You Chris Hemsworth? Why you killed your own figure? You're not like Tom Hiddlestone who still can manage his own figure, Loki, he's still have characters. Even thou it's turn into comedy movie, he's keeping his own pride characters. And yeah Benedict, he played so well to keep the Dr Strange as a character, even it's (again and again) a comedy movie. But he still have it's character as a keeper. Stronger beings. And so for Mark Ruffalo, who keep the hulk character. It's cool how he keep confused become a human again. They're well played. But you Chris? You makes me so disappointed... is that really how a God Characters looks like? No charisma at all? More weak and not smarter than a human? Oh please.. or this is your hidden agenda? It's beyond dude~~~Welcome To Stan Lee Comedy Show with big budget and cool CGI only to trolling you and makes a die hard fans got away from you. You can keep all those cheesy shallow fans to get along you with this Deadpool Pattern With Guardians Of Galaxy CGI thingy. But not me. Surprised me next time, OK?",

Its whimsical tone and easy to follow story pace makes it a film perfect for anyone who wants a light superhero movie.For me personally, i find this movie... cringed. Thor major 180 flip personality, Loki tone down power hungry manipulative personality, the some what short serious tone in between, the unnecessary Dr. Strange scene, the death of friends. Welp it seems that Jane dumping Thor makes his movie lighter and funnier. Overall its still one of the best movie to watch with family and or friends. The super light and fun characters is truly a blessing. It feels more like a stand-alone movie rather than a part of a series. Its just that fun! You don't need to watch the 1st and 2nd Thor movie, this movie will make you fall in love with Thor (more like Thor 2.0 Taika style).",

The movie could have been fine without the comic relief character.2) Bad CGI - not all CGI was terrible, but if you paid attention to the background images it would become really obvious that the lighting isn't natural and the sense of depth is missing.3) Characters feel immortal - It's kind of ridiculous that Thor can survive immense attacks by blunt weapons and being smacked into a wall easily. As a viewer, I don't know what it takes for Thor to be in danger.4) Coincidences - Everything that happens to the characters are extremely convenient for the story to continue. The amount of times characters stumble into each other by chance is unrealistic.5) Dumb Clichés - There's a bunch. Can't say without giving away spoilers though. If you're watching it, expect good action sequences and everything else from solo Marvel movies.",

    "reviewTitle": "Guaranteeing a \"safe passage through the anus\"",
    "reviewBody": "I'm neither a Marvel fan, nor (in particular) a Thor fan.. but I have to admit \"Thor: Ragnarok\" was brilliant from beginning to end. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been travelling the universe in search of stuff (I neither remember nor care) but returns to his home planet of Asgard with a dire warning of impending 'Raganrok': this being the 'End of Days' for Asgard. But he finds the court engaged in serious leisure time!Things go from bad to worse when Hela (Cate Blanchett, \"Carol\") – someone with more than a passing relationship to Thor – arrives with a mission to assume the throne. Teamed uncomfortably with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, \"High Rise\"), the brothers get cast millions of light years away to a planet lorded over by a 'grand master' (a lovely performance, that I will leave anonymous here) who pits new gladiators in an arena against his latest champion. You'll never guess who his champion is? Well, OK (cos the trailer gives it away) he's big and green! The film's script is hilarious. It generates an enormous volume of entertainment with laugh-out loud moments throughout; the unforeseen involvement of other Marvel characters; some startling cameos all mixed with the usual brand of spectacular fights and action. Some of the action is surprising: a real eye-opener you might say.The lead cast (Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett and Ruffalo) all perform admirably and are joined by heavyweight cameos from Anthony Hopkins (\"Westworld\") and Idris Elba (\"Bastille Day\") reprising their roles from \"Thor: The Dark World\". Particularly impressive is Tessa Thompson (\"Creed\") as Thor's Valkyrie warrior side-kick and Karl Urban (\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\") as the turn-coat Asgardian Skurge.Directed by young New Zealander Taika Waititi (behind last year's successful indie hit \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\") it's a breath of fresh air for the Thor franchise, more similar to the style of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" rather than the previous films in the series. Waititi also saves all the best comedy lines for himself as the 'rock warrior' character Korg: his New Zealand twang delivering just side- splitting dialogue. As with most Marvel films, its a little bit flabby in places, running to 130 minutes: some of the dialogue, particularly scenes between Hemsworth and Ruffalo, feel like they needed tightening up in the editing suite. This time of course includes the scrolling of endless teams of visual effect artists in the closing titles which – naturally – 90% of the audience stay for to see if there are any \"monkeys\". In fact,there are two: one fairly early on; the other right at the end. (To be honest, I thought neither of them was particularly worth waiting for). However overall the movie is highly recommended for a fun night out at the cinema. By the way, this is a film best viewed cold if someone tries to tell you the surprises, cut them off quick!(Thor (sic) the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks!).",

    "reviewTitle": "Get ready to Ragnarok & Roll - this film is the most fun you'll have in a cinema all year!",
    "reviewBody": "In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of literal doom and gloom, it's an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that pretty much describes the world in which we currently live, it's actually rather fitting that Marvel's 17th studio film is something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a raucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes. Thank Thor (and director Taika Waititi) for that!We reunite with Thor (Hemsworth) - still free of new Infinity Stones, freshly confident that he's once again warded off the fabled Ragnarok - just as he discovers that something is rotten in the state of Asgard. As teased at the end of Thor: The Dark World, Loki (Hiddleston), his shape-shifting trickster brother, has been impersonating their ailing dad, Odin (Hopkins). When Odin's strength finally fails, the dark secret he's been keeping at bay storms into the lives of his sons: Hela (Blanchett), their bloodthirsty older sister, is back to claim the throne she believes is rightfully hers.For (largely) better or (occasionally) worse, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't dwell as much on the royal family drama as its predecessors did. Instead, its second act plays out on the candy-coated, death-dealing planet of Sakaar. Ruled by the whims and fancies of the Grandmaster (Goldblum dialled to 11), Sakaar's people are relentlessly entertained in their very own battle dome. (Think the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome, with holographic screens and super-powered alien beings.) Following an initial devastating confrontation with Hela, Thor is stranded on Sakaar, and brought in by the mercenary Valkyrie (Thompson) to stand against the raging primal force of the Hulk (Ruffalo) - not quite the \"friend from work\" Thor remembers. If that all sounds like serious business, rest assured it's very much not. There's a gentle wit threaded through every frame of this film - a glorious, big-hearted silliness that fans of Taika Waititi will remember (and treasure) from such indie comedy gems as What We Did In The Shadows and Hunt For The Wilderpeople. Miraculously, Waititi has managed to infuse this gargantuan, green-screened epic with his trademark offbeat vibe, best exemplified in the way key plot points are revealed (via sardonic monologue or ironic stage play) and the character he plays (Korg, a chirpy rock monster who befriends Thor before our hero heads into the arena). Waititi's involvement is a blessing for pretty much everyone involved in the film, but especially for Hemsworth. It's not that he hasn't been good in his previous appearances as the God of Thunder throughout the franchise - he was suavely charming in Thor and resolutely grim in The Dark World. But he's so remarkably good here, switching effortlessly between bright-eyed puppy and care-worn leader, that it feels like he's finally come home. Hemsworth's performance in this film is a fantastic balance of sunshine, silliness and subversiveness, and it's a joy to behold.It's clear, too, that everyone in the cast - including respected veterans like Hopkins and Blanchett - were delighted to partake in the film's mirth and mayhem. Ruffalo continues to play the dual aspects of Bruce Banner - looming brute and mild-mannered professor - with so much winning charm that you want him to get his own Hulk movie, stat. Hiddleston is totally game for playing up the odd- couple comedy of Loki's rivalry with Thor, while shading unexpected complexity into his character's machinations. Thompson swaggers off with practically every scene she's in, finding the heart, humour and heroism in an Asgardian warrior who's lost her way. Perhaps more impressively, Waititi handles every Marvel blockbuster's requisite action scenes with more clarity and flair than you'd expect from an indie director. He manages to find character and comedy beats even in swooping spaceship chases and bruising hand-to-hand combat. There's a thrilling fluidity to the action sequences - whether it's Thor soaring towards his enemies like lightning made flesh, or Hela unleashing her multiple projectiles of death with a dark, graceful beauty.That's not to say Thor: Ragnarok is perfect. As it turns out, the film's greatest strength - apocalypse as afterthought - is also its biggest flaw. Waititi just about manages to find the emotional weight in Thor coming to terms with his power and leadership (a driving theme for this character), but it does get a little lost in all the knockabout comedy. Thanks to Blanchett, Hela is never less than terrifying: she oozes gleeful malevolence in her wake, forcing Thor to confront his own gold-tinted ideas of himself, his family and his history. Alas, she's also one of that peculiar breed of antagonist who's immeasurably powerful and strangely ineffective, all at the same time. For years, Marvel has been making brave choices in terms of the directors to whom it has entrusted its stories and characters. This strategy has yielded films that are, for the most part, creatively diverse, ranging in quality from decent to excellent. Even so, handing the reins of the Thor franchise to a director with such a unique voice as Waititi might have been its biggest gamble yet. Fortunately, it pays off in spades. Smart, silly and self-aware, Thor: Ragnarok is a blockbuster that feels like it snuck into cinemas by way of the art-house. It's also that rare threequel which isn't just as good as its predecessors - it's easily the best of the lot.",

    "reviewTitle": "An utter blast",
    "reviewBody": "Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is pitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to Asgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.It's testament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce work as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with such vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so far.With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny it ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and Hulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. It's the screenplay from Eric Pearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters we're introduced to, Korg in particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCU's most welcome additions.The action, of which there is plenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaugh's score and even Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, which kicks the finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography combines seamlessly with the expectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.Coming to the performances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts at one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness and naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just can't imagine anyone else playing Thor.The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work as the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role of Loki and he's expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why he's such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer Tessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as Valkyrie. If you're a fan of Jeff Goldblum then I'd just like to say you won't be disappointed with his performance as Grandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of the piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she suited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why can't the villains have some as well?Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs and plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait.",

(whether or not \"Justice League\" could live up to that title, I guess we'll never know until November the 17th arrives) Some critics (or maybe just one, I dunno) say that \"Thor Ragnarok\" is the boldest Marvel movie to date, in which I say it's true! I mean, how they stir and twist one of the greatest and the most well- known mythology in the world into a super-hilarious comic book movie (that perhaps upsets some people in the Scandinavian countries, from which the epic tales of Thor originated) that people and fans love is the key to Marvel Studios success. I never knew who Taika Waititi was before, but after I saw his movie yesterday, I can confidently say that he is one of the most promising new names in fully-packed- action-movie genre in the history of Hollywood.now that I have watched this movie yesterday, I'm now looking forward to watching other Marvel Studio movies in the years to come such as Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, Captain Marvel, and the most importantly, Avengers: Infinity War and its sequel. The wait is killing me, wake me up when those movies arrive on the theater, will ya?",

    "reviewBody": "Three Thor movies, three quite different films. On this occasion, after the much lauded success of other films in the franchise like Guardians and Deadpool. (Which I love.) It is easy to see why they would choose to duplicate the comedic style.This is my favourite of the three Thor films by a clear margin. I was chuckling quite regularly from the very first scene. However I did think are they taking the balance of comedy and drama a bit too far at times. Often you feel yourself hanging on waiting to see if there is a punchline coming even in the more dramatic moments. Even when the bodies are piling up. (The Sokovia Accords have no jurisdiction in the wider universe.) For the most part the directors approach of encouraging improvisation does appear to work very well. But sometimes it does feel like there is a real lack of the \"straight man\" to add structure to the chain gun of gags.On the whole I enjoyed Thor Ragnarok. It falls into the top five of my fav Marvel movies.",

    "reviewBody": "I saw this film at the Beckenham Odeon in London. The beginning of this film was as impactful as the bullet-time opening of Swordfish. So that set the movie off at with very high expectation indeed. Hela's part in the story was as expected, and nothing changed from the trailers. She's very powerful, and also very single-minded. Hulk's treatment in the film was in two parts - when he was the Hulk, he was a star, but when he was not hulk, he was a bit part player. I'm not sure I liked how his role was handled in the film, but I suppose anymore exposure of the Hulk, would have taken the shine off Thor himself. So maybe its understandable. I personally felt that more could have been made of the Hulk's character. What did make the film stand out though was the comedy. It was very unexpected, and also brilliantly done! Along the way, Thor meets a minor gladiator, who turns out to be the funniest guy ever! You'll have to see for yourself, but his deadpan delivery turns the film almost into a comedy, every time he's on the screen! The battle scenes were good, but not to the level of LOTR, for scope and spectacle. I enjoyed it, but I feel that it fell just a little bit short of the standard that Wonder Woman delivered. But it did set up the forthcoming space-based Marvel films very well (Black Panther was not referenced).",

    "reviewBody": "*TWO* POST CREDIT SCENES TO WATCH!Great starting sequence was pure magic, the banter, cinematography and the ACTION! What I admired about this film is Taika Waititis brilliant humor, being from New Zealand appreciating it even more so. The action sequences were slick, crisp, and actually watchable - as opposed to many other movies who cover up the action with motion blur, too much camera work or just not enough scene time to appreciate the spectacle. Hulk and Thor were brilliant in this film, CGI was the best I've seen for the Hulk, and his scenes with Thor are hilariously funny. Hella was hellish and I loved it, her story interestingly made sense tying her into the movie and not making it feel forced. Supporting cast of Valkyrie, Skurge, Korg, Grandmaster, Loki, Odin etc... all had their place and they all had their moments to shine, which is hard to do in a movie with a plethora of characters. Only thing to note is the pacing is sometimes a bit abrupt going to and from other stories happening within the movie, but it's not a biggy at all. One small thing is some impactful and emotional scenes (which you'll know what I'm talking about) didn't feel like it had the depth or impact that it should of – Maybe it's just me, but I'll see this movie a few more times over and maybe edit this as I would have had more time to reflect on it. All in all, from start to finish Ragnarok is a roller coaster ride of beautiful action pieces, quirky and snappy humor and a flagship for other Superhero movies to strive Thor!",

But before I get out, let me add a couple of things.I don't remember much, but as far as I can tell, this is a second super heroes movies that the soundtrack really hit the spot, Led Zeppelin's Immigrant song is kick ass, and its really help to create perfect atmosphere while Thor kicking ass.This movie do provide more color than usual, literally, and throw a lot of comedies, showing that it's okay for a big scary dude to act dork, I'm looking at you Hulk, you're kinda cute there, you too lord of... err, god of thunder. Thor, we still like you even though you're not a strongest Avengers (that's what quinn jet says).All in all, this movie is gooood. There, 'nuf said, I'm out of here, maybe to watch it again. Or maybe later, when I'm sure I can pick a good position, rather than forced to take the last available chair.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor strikes again",
    "reviewBody": "Thor has never been my favourite avenger. Although I quite enjoyed his first movie, I hated the second one, and didn't quite know what to expect with this one. However, I absolutely loved it! In the opening scene the humour felt a bit awkward but it quickly gets better throughout, and had the whole cinema of people laughing. I've seen several people compare it to Guardians Of The Galaxy which I think is quite accurate.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) was brilliant in this movie. He suited the humour really well and played it up quite a bit. It also wouldn't be a Thor film if we didn't have a shirtless scene at some point, and who's complaining to be honest. In my opinion the character was a lot better without the annoying love interest of Jane, who for me personally brought absolutely nothing to the first two movies. She is conveniently tied off when some random human mentions that she dumped Thor, and that's all we hear about her at all. I think the Valkyrie is supposed to be the new love interest, and she shared one or two little moments with Thor throughout the film which was nice. She's a drunk, feisty Asgardian and at least she has more personality than Jane. Just saying, sorry to any Jane fans out there. The dynamic between Thor and Hulk was pretty fun too and he was a welcome addition to the film.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is amazing as always. I'm a bit of a Loki fangirl to be honest so I'm slightly biased, but he was funny as ever. We still don't really know what he's doing, as at some points he tries to save Thor and the next he betrays him again, which is kind of annoying. The thing that still hasn't been explained from the first movie though is if he is a frost giant why does he have godly powers? I don't understand! Anyway at the end there are some brotherly bonding moments, and all seems pretty good between them. For now.The absolute best new character was Korg. A lot of the best jokes came from him and I hope we see more of this character at some point. Hela was also quite a good villain, she had a straightforward aim and plan, which makes a change from Loki's confusing plots. Kinda feel a little sorry for her but not really.Let's talk a little about the plot. Thor wants to prevent Ragnarok, which you probably know as basically the doomsday of Norse mythology. Whilst on Midgard discussing it with Odin, Odin passes away, meaning Thor's evil sister is released from wherever Odin's magic was containing her. The thing that seemed a little strange to me as that nobody knew who Hela was? She was around when Odin was conquering the nine realms, so do no Asgardians remember that? I'm also not sure about the whole evil sister thing, we kind of already had that with Loki but oh well. Also if Hela is literally the goddess of death why can't she just kill everyone with a click of her fingers if she's so 'super powerful' and everything, like how Thor can summon lightening. Oh well.As usual with Marvel films, great songs, cinematography and special effects. Fight scenes were good, plenty of badass moments.Honestly this is the best Thor film, go watch it. It's a good laugh and great action and you won't be disappointed.",

    "reviewTitle": "It's Ragnarok, not a day out at Disney World, Marvel.",
    "reviewBody": "If you like your comicbook superhero films full of one-liners, nonsensical plotting, drastic character changes, underdeveloped villains, missing important characters (for no other reason other than they were probably unavailable) then Thor 3 is right up your street. For me, its another wasted opportunity. For the record, I loved Thor 1, disliked Thor 2 and Thor 3 is perhaps a slightly better film than the second one, but I'm rating it lower because it had the opportunity to be so much more than what it was. Ragnarok should not be a comedy buddy film. The consistent comedy played throughout this film (which is literally from the first scene until the last) just feels so out of place in a film that has what should be an epic and profound story. In the context of the film, it removes any semblance of doom, or indeed care to the main characters - if they are able to laugh and joke about the situation, why the hell should you as a viewer care? This comedic attitude spoils what could have been an epic story line. Right from Thor uncovering Loki's deception (and his reaction to that most heinous crime which is somewhat unbelievable) to Kiwi Gladiators constantly cracking jokes in the arena which should be a life or death situation (and in turn, reducing the middle act to a ponderous, overtly long section that is only there to bring Hulk and Thor together), to the most ridiculous character motivational change in the history of Marvel films (looking at you Valkyrie), Thor 3 is a completely wasted story that fails to live up to the hype on almost every conceivable level. I say \"almost\" as the Hulk once again proves a success, adding a layer of development we seem to get to his character in every Marvel film he is in. Other new and returning characters do not fair so well. I'm trying to understand why Tessa Thompson was raved about so much. Forgiving that the character has been completely redesigned from the comicbooks, she is so underdeveloped I have little comprehension why she hates Asgard in the first place, and then returns so quickly by Thor's side. Perhaps the tequila wore off. There's nothing wrong with her performance, there just isn't anything three-dimensional to her character. Loki. God Loki. He's just Loki. Again. It doesn't matter what this guy does, he's just constantly forgiven - for absolutely no reason when his crimes are looked at in the cold light of day. For God's sake Thor, Hela was attempting to do nothing that Loki had already done. It makes no sense. As for Scurge...was he actually even in it? Why was he in it? What purpose did he have?Hela - well, as a design and character, she looked the part, had an awesome power set and an interesting take on things. She probably had some really great reasons for doing what she was doing, when she was doing them. We just, like every other Marvel villain, never get to fully flesh them out. I can't help but think there was a great character there, played by the right person, but its never truly allowed to flourish and gather weight. The \"re-writing\" of the Universe is also a little hard to take with her introduction. Nobody seems to question it. Everybody just accepts it. Not for me I'm afraid. Here's hoping that Avengers 3 can bring this MCU ship back, cause at the moment, the last two films have veered massively off course.",

    "reviewBody": "Thor RagnarokFor me the first two solo outings of the guy with the 80's hair and big hammer were average at best. Thor's turn in the two Avengers movies was much better, but his ability to carry a movie by himself seemed too heavy for those ridiculously large biceps of his. Not that this was anything to do with Chris Hemsworth's performance. Certainly not, it was more to do with the blandness of the actual character.In this third solo movie the creators have gone to town. This is a full blown comedy first, superhero movie second, and for the most part it works well. The storyline is pretty much painting by numbers superhero stuff but it's the way it's delivered that makes this movie such an enjoyable experience. Hemsworth is allowed to exercise his comedic chops and many of the improvised scenes work to side splitting effect. An equally funny supporting cast all seem to be having a good time. Cate Blanchett brings a level of sophistication to her sexy villainous role and Jeff Goldblum lights up the screen at every opportunity.The hulk has never looked better. Far gone are the days of early CGI Hulk when he looked like a cartoon superimposed onto screen. He is given a bit of depth here instead of just being the big green angry guy that smashes the snot out of everyone. Still, he does do quite a lot of snot smashing, but hey, it wouldn't be the hulk otherwise. Karl Urban does a cockney accent, at least I think that's what it was and Idris Elba shows up. Most likely to honour his contract. His appearance is welcome though as he's cool in everything he appears in.I haven't gone in to too much about the plot as to be honest I can't remember what the hell this was all about. I just know I had a good time and by the looks of it everyone involved did so too.",

    "reviewBody": "I will try not to give out any spoilers, but at the same time I must warn you about this movie, yes, you read it right, warn you.We all know the Thor movies are not exactly the brightest gem in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but after the mistakes of Thor: The Dark World you would think they would have learned their lesson, after all this movie is the end of the trilogy and I am personally happy it finally ends.The movie tries to mix two classic stories from the comics: Ragnarok and Planet Hulk, very ambitious I must say, but this is a blend that will make you ill, let me explain you why.The movie is 130 minutes long, yet one of the greatest and more powerful villains the MCU has ever had, Hela, only gets about 20 minutes of screen time, and in those 20 minutes you can see Cate Blanchett trying her hardest to give depth to the character, but even someone as immensely talented as her cannot pull the impossible, Hela, The Goddess of Death has been turned into a 2 dimensional cartoon.The first act is pretty weak, and you can see the script rushes as much as they possibly can to get to the second act, which is where they try to adapt Planet Hulk, and that part takes most of the screen time and it is so boring it is not even funny. They tried to integrate a space opera of revolution against an evil dictator into the story of Ragnarok, but it is rushed, contrived and boring, and I mean mind boggling boring.Then we get to the third act where the battle takes place in Asgard and Hela's army fights \"The Revengers\", I won't spoil any further but I will say that when you think quality will improve, it does not, not one bit.This entry has to be hands down one of the worst movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am an MCU fan boy but I have to be truthful, and I give it 6/10, and I am being nice. This was an amalgamation of two stories that could have been great as separate entities, but not combined, at least not in the incompetent hands of Taika Waititi, who does not deserve respect at all.",

    "reviewTitle": "A much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok is the third standalone Thor movie and the fifth film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), this installment gives the Thor films a much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors.Two years after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds himself imprisoned on a distant planet where he is forced to do battle in a gladiatorial duel against his former friend, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Meanwhile, Thor's home realm of Asgard is under attack by the powerful Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans to bring it to an end during the oncoming apocalyptic event known as Ragnarok.Considering how bleak and serious the first two Thor films were (mainly the second film), Thor: Ragnarok thankfully takes a different route by injecting more humour and colour into the story to become one of the most fun and entertaining films in the MCU to date. All of the film's comedic moments worked well, and didn't feel as though they were just inserted for the sake of generic comic relief. Another issue I feel is that the original two focused too much on Loki (Tom Hiddleston), making us forget that Thor was supposed to be the main character. Thankfully, Loki, while still having an important and amusing role in the story, is merely a supporting character and Thor himself is given the proper development needed to move the film along nicely. As with all films in the MCU, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8/10",

It gets to a point where I think there is too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, the balance of comedy and heroic action is successfully struck by the middle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film induces giggles, but do not distract viewers from the story. The story is intense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yet chill inducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any of her previous film. I feel a little sad about what happens to the main character, and I wish it did not turn out that way. I enjoyed watching it, even though I wish the superhero elements is emphasised more.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor: Ragnarok Review",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok is coming out at a time where people are starting to ask if we have reached comic book fatigue. To that, Thor: Ragnarok puts a big cross through that thought. Thor changes the game. We can't get tired of a sub-genre when the films keep reinventing themselves every time.Ragnarok is a blast start to finish. If you are someone who liked laughing, then you will have a smile from start to finish. Every bit of humour hits and if you are an Australian like me, you will get a kick out of a few jokes.If Ragnarok was a chain, there would not be a weak link. While some links are weaker than others, there is no outright weak part of the film. Everything was at the minimum, just solid. Every character felt like like they were used close to their potential. Every actor and actress put in the performance they needed. You felt like 99% of characters were done perfectly. The only slight complaint that can be had about characters in this film was the villain of Hella.Like most Marvel villains, she is terrifically performed by Kate Blanchett and she is a force when she needs to be, but by the time Black Panther comes around next year, she will be quite forgettable. What they did do well with her however was use her to set up some terrific Thor history.As mentioned, the humour was outstanding, and I think that comes down to Taika Waititi. While he didn't get a writing credit on the film, you know by the style of the humour that he had a lot of input into what was happening on screen.While still on Taika, his directing was fantastic. There are some shots in this film that I want as a wallpaper because they are look like they should be paintings. The action was shot really well, the emotional moments had an intimate to them and of course the wide shots of the landscapes were brilliant.Something I really noticed this is the use of the music. They really tapped into the Guardians music style and it worked so well with what was happening on screen. They had a nice balance of using songs when needed but working in score when it is much needed.Ragnorok is a film that if you are going to have a problem with something, chances are it is going to be something personal. For me, what stood out as a negative was the pacing, however that comes of the back of a massive positive. This film is trying to balance two stories that could have easily been a film separately, and does a really good job of it, however I felt as though the Ragnorok story line did feel a bit short changed at the end. They weave the two stories well but at the end of the day, Thor can only be present in one story at a time.Overall, Thor: Ragnorok is a blast from start to finish. It captured the humour and light hearted fun that the first Guardians had and took it to a level you wouldn't of been able to think of. Taika Waititi was by far the stand out of the film both infront and behind the camera, and it couldn't have been achieved without him. As mention, if the film was a chain, the weakest link would still be over 90% strong.9.5/10",

    "reviewTitle": "This movie failed in every possible level.",
    "reviewBody": "I'm not a hater of comic book-based movies, and it is difficult, considering 2/5 of the movies that appear in movie theaters are based on comic book, if you want to see a movie with action and effects, in the end you always end up with one or another of this type of movie. Blame Hollywood and the mentality of wanting to get the milk from the cow in greater quantity in the shortest possible time.And this movie fails on almost every level, first, the movie begins with a set piece when Thor confronts a fire demon, before this, begins a monologue of this demon on Ragnarok. Honestly, who was the amateur puts such a big exposition before an action scene. And in the midst of these two things, Thor begins to make jokes about being attached to chains. Honestly the editing of this movie is horrible.And that goes for the whole movie. Another example, Odin ends up dying at the end of the first act, and soon afterwards appears an action scene with Hela. The public still barely chewed Odin's death scene - scene loses all emotional impact - a set piece appears which should have an emotional impact - the destruction of Thor's hammer - turns out to have no impact at all. Worse, both scenes lost their impact and ended up canceling each other out.The editing is so horrible, the pace is so fast that not only the emotional scenes lose their emotional focus, the action scenes are flawed and the suspense scenes do not work and the whole movie is gone down the drain, in which the movie can not be chewed and the movie looks like a Mcdonald's meal. Just a factory product. In addition, the film addresses the destruction of a civilization and a race - in this case Asgard - of such a simplistic manners, and in such a hurried way. This film needs (at least) 3 hours for development and make an satisfactory establish for the final battle (considering how many subplots this movie has), instead this is a 2 hours film of second-rate jokes.A movie to fill your eyes, but nothing is left in the mind and because of this movie is easily forgotten after the credits pass. Even the special effects are horrendous. The Hulk continues to be a digital doll and being made by a computer - what's the point of putting the Hulk in the film, but as a way to call more fanboys and sell more tickets, if the Hulk were not in the movie, this movie would make a smaller box-office and less money would went into Disney's account. Not to mention the big wolf, like the hulk, is a computer-made digital doll. The effects that should have been the decoy of the film are amateurs and lousy. Everything in this film fails. In other words, this movie as blockbuster fails to show grandiose special effects and action scenes, the movie fails at all levels. Look, I hate Avatar, but James Cameron knows how to make a great visual spectacle with great action scenes, a beautiful but empty movie. Thor 3 is rubbish at all levels, especially in its proposal (special effects and action scenes). And this for me this is the biggest sin of this movie, because this movie failed in all its objectives.",

One of the biggest positives of the movie is it has the right amount of known/beloved characters and new/exciting characters. However, as a negative aspect of this movie, I would say this is the most Marvelish movie yet. They treat everything as an opportunity for a goof. However, thanks to the chemistry between Hulk-Thor-Loki, it will be a stand-out movie in the highly crowded MCU. To sum it up this movie was a riot from start to finish.

However, I definitely see Brunnhilde becoming integral part of the MCU and can see her character being expanded upon if they make a Thor 4.The soundtrack (which I loved), CGI, and action all complement the movie. Taika Waititi directing was, as always superb and I would love to see Marvel Studios give him more projects to work on. I think his humor would fit Spider-Man or Iron Man pretty well. The reason this doesn't get ten stars because yet again the villain is underdeveloped and although we're told time and time again that Hela is this all powerful Goddess I don't quite feel it. I can't really discuss it without going into spoilers, but I found the character underwhelming a bit. However, Cate Blanchett was amazing both to look at and her performance. I would highly recommend you go see this. Probably best Superhero movie of the year in my opinion.",

    "reviewBody": "Everyone knows that Marvel movies are well produced, the company that was founded by Stan Lee already skidded in the past, but currently more hits than misses. Unfortunately your failure in the past was to have sold the copyright to some of his heroes to other producers, that tactic was used not to break in a time of crisis of movie heroes. With the explosion of movies from Spider-man (2002) the company carried on and went back to producing movies of their heroes. The first Thor movie was released in 2011, and it was a great movie. I recall the success this film has done at the time. but the second film Thor the dark world (2013) are no longer managed to be so good. Film has multiple errors in the narrative and it was very confusing, and had no villain.Thor Ragnarok begins two years after the Avengers (2012). Thor is the defending world and still does not know that your brother seized the Throne from his father in the second movie. Upon returning to Asgard discovers that your brother is leading and that your father is missing. With this he begins a long journey in search of your father along with Loki. On the way ends up having a hand of Dr. strange \"scene that is post movie credit Dr. strange\". Thor just knowing that Asgard is in danger and that Cate Blanchett (Hela) is on his way to kill everyone. He ends up finding the Hulk on the way back to Asgard in search of resume peace and order.Thor Ragnarok managed to bring the essence of Marvel after a few years. Film is very well written, has amazing graphics and impresses in the narrative. Hulk works great the hero is in your best shape and performance since the Avengers (2012), who had an excellent performance and left the film even more complete. Cate Blanchett (Hela) has an impeccable performance to me she was a great villain of the Marvel movies, your character really scary. The film is full of action with a quality humor without being forced. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) still has a great chemistry on screen that has been creating over the time together really work well and makes the story even more fluid. Marvel hit movie and managed to overcome other great long as, Avengers (2012) and Civil War (2016).The third film of Thor is the best Marvel movie ever made! Time for fun is guaranteed. A tip ... have two movie scenes post credits not lose.",

I was sitting in the mid when I heard someone impressed by the first appearance of Hela (Cate Blanchett), she was gorgeous. Bringing the first female villain and they didn't messed it up. I gave 8 out of 10 because I was hoping more action more rampaging hulk. My conclusion, they adds more comedy",

    "reviewBody": "Disorienting, loud and ugly, often all at the same time, Thor: Ragnarok boasts a cast of great Marvel characters and rich mythological storytelling--but squanders its potential by being nothing more than a paint by numbers action/comedy with a tone stuck somewhere between a Michael Bay film and a bad SNL skit. What makes it worse is that every attempt at comedy fails completely, and either kills the tension (not that there is much in the first place) or distracts from the plot. The plot is thin and glossed over, and the characters... there are none. Every character in this film is doing roughly the same thing-- a bit. A comedy bit to make the audience laugh. There is no real depth or humanity to this film, just jokes and bad CGI held together with more jokes. Awful choreography and sound design and basically no camera work at all, the film is shot like its a Clerks movie and is very bland to watch. I hope director Taika Waititi keeps away from blockbusters in the future--if only to save himself from anymore embarrassment. The already weak Thor trilogy ends on its lowest low.

    "reviewTitle": "Fine for what it is....",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok (2017, Taika Waititi) In last years mega-hit film 'Captain America: Civil War' we saw pretty much all of the earthbound Marvel characters turn up except Thor and The Hulk/Bruce Banner. So now its time for us to see what they have been up to in the meantime. New Zealand indie director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) works with a budget for the first time to bring us the third entry in the Thor series that looks and feels more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film in many ways. We have a film set mostly in space and other planets with colorful and goofy characters everywhere and jokes inserted into every scene... but unlike Guardians and the other better MCU films.. this one lacks any emotional resonance.The story telling is a bit of a jumbled mess but tries to blow through plot points so fast that you might not notice. The action scenes are effects heavy but lack excitement, stakes or tension. Despite its many shortcomings though it is fast enough and funny enough to entertain throughout. The highlights for me were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the director himself as a humorous side character names Korg. Hemsworth was great as always as Thor and Tessa Thompson did not disappoint as Valkyrie.The new thing that I noticed atmosphere wise was a much more interesting score than the traditional MCU films have had with a mostly Synth' based score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie), who is an unusual choice for score but it paid dividends. In the end the film is not a great film, nor a bad film but an inconsequential yet funny film.5.5/10",

    "reviewBody": "I honestly came to the cinema with high expectation, especially knowing that Hulk and Doctor Strange will feature in the movie. However after I spent the hours of watching, I would like to say that it was an okay movie but not really something really memorable.Aside of the stunning CGI, the humor are pretty much not as hilarious as usual. They still are funny, but some came to be failed though.The plot were pretty predictable, and it was lack of depth. I would not put things in detail since it will be a spoiler but overall, it did not impress as much as other Marvel's project this year. The villain was cool, but the battle and how they get the victory was pretty, how would I say it, not as thrilling as I expected.As the sum up, this movie was more to 'classic super hero plot where the hero get some problem then gain incredible improvement in his power then win the battle' thing than something with surprise and lack of depth or plot development aspect. But it will still be a good movie for you to watch at home on your laptop while needing something entertaining as a companion.",

Please leave this to Deadpool, even the stupid GoG2 proved you have to draw the line somewhere. Why is Loki such an inconsistent idiot? Why are we spoonfed everything? It even manages to assume the audience are a bunch of dumdums for example by using the same \"i forgot what my powers are, oh a convenient vision\" twice, ruining the twist (or whatever it was supposed to be).

    "reviewTitle": "Misses the mark",
    "reviewBody": "Went to see Thor: Ragnarok with an open mind as I am a regular movie goer, at least once a week year in year out. Was not expecting anything beyond the usual Marvel output which is usually reasonably entertaining. Ragnarok, falls short in a number of ways not the least of which was the annoying attempts at humor. The humor was puerile and aimed more at the prepubescent rather than anyone with a developed sense of humor above the most rudimentary level, as evidenced by the fact that in a theater of some 400 mainly Millennials there was only one collective laugh and that was Thor and the bowling ball. Apart from that there only a couple of isolated titters. The movie on the whole appears to be aimed at a Grade School intellect, starting from the ridiculous lead in intro with Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Waititi, and a movie fan prior to the movie commencing. The movie relied far too much on CGI which wasn't up to standard and over the top at times. Hemsworth's performance is generic and bland while Ruffalo puts in his usual average effort. Blanchett was the Star of the show while the rest of the cast were OK but don't blink or you will miss Idris Elba's performance. Looking at the 10/10s given on IMDb on opening day one can only assume they are from studio/corporate hacks to boost the ratings rather than from genuine IMDb contributors.

    "reviewTitle": "My head is Thor",
    "reviewBody": "I went in to this film maybe a little too expectant, I love Marvel, love the Thor comic character, and love the way Chris Hemsworth portrays him on the screen. However, this film is COMPLETELY different to every other portrayal of Thor and it doesn't work. Thor's comedy has generally stemmed from his failure to integrate with humans on earth, when he was on Asgard he was this regal, well versed, humble, albeit slightly cocky character, yet from his first scene you can tell the film is taking a completely different route with him. And this is where the main problem of the film lies. For a film called \"Ragnarok\", which is basically about the death & destruction of Asgard, there is too much of a light tone throughout this film and WAY TOO much \"comic\" dialogue - I put that in speech marks as a lot of the one liners do not work and fall flat, and this is purely because of the sheer volume of them in the film. Comedy only works when there is a straight man to work off, yet nearly every character in the film is written the same and thus loses their individuality. This is such a shame as it causes the film to lose all impact on the sad or serious moments. Within the first 30 minutes Thor discovers the Loki is posing as Odin and, instead of being A: amazed he's still alive, and B: He's somehow banished his all powerful father, he simply laughs this off as a little joke Loki has played, then when they find Odin and he subsequently \"dies\" just before they meet Hela, who then goes on to destroy Mjolnir, there is no mourning period and before you know it we're on Sakaar being treated to no end of electrocution jokes.(Though isn't Thor the god of Thunder and can summon lightning?? Why would he be incapacitated by an electric shock?)It's such a shame that, as Thor has just lost 2 of the most important things to him, this isn't given time to sink in or be dealt with and is just glazed over with a quick childish argument with the Hulk.It's not all bad though, I found once on Sakaar the film picked up somewhat. The Hulk/Thor fight doesn't disappoint, and there were a couple of nice character additions here, the Grandmaster was better than I thought he would be and wasn't too \"Goldblum\", Korg is probably the funniest part of this film and his comic lines do work well, I would like to see him return again. Hulk is fleshed out a bit more as well and we continue to see the internal struggle between him and Banner during the film. Another addition is Skurge who, the less said about him, the better..! Pointless, waste of time being in the film. Valkyrie is a strange character, I know she was completely changed from the comic books, but I don't think that the character is particularly well developed and thus I wasn't really invested in her at all during the movie. I also think the part quite easily could have been portrayed by Lady Sif, (who is strangely absent in the film despite the warriors 3 appearing??) And would have had more impact in the plot than the reasoning behind Valkyrie's self imposed exile. But the main plus point from the film, which is music to Marvel fan's ears, is Hela is a success as a villain, it has been a long time since we've had a villain to rival Loki (who FYI is wasted in the film and is getting a bit annoying now) but Hela is great, we got some development in to her character, albeit a little small, but I very much look forward to her appearing in Infinity War so we can hopefully develop her further.So whilst it's not the best Marvel film, it's certainly not the worst by a long shot. I did enjoy it, it was just the constant barrage of jokes wore very thin very quickly and definitely detracted from the overall story. But with all this said, my non fan boy friend loved the film....!",

    "reviewTitle": "Many things frustrated me",
    "reviewBody": "This isn't really a review per se, I just needed somewhere to get things off my chest about this movie.So here's a list of things that bothered me:One thing I love about the Marvel Studios Cinematic Universe is the continuity. Most movie franchises are fairly relaxed on continuity (which I am very opposed to), or in some cases blatantly disregard it (Fox's X-Men franchise, for example), so it's really nice to have a big franchise where everything little thing adds up. However, unless I'm missing something, Ragnarok screws that up.In The last Thor movie, The Dark World, it is stated that Asgardians live for roughly 5,000 years. This is later corroborated when we learn the convergence of the nine realms (seemingly coincidentally) also happens every 5,000 years, and Odin's father, Bor (then King of Asgard), was the one who dealt with Malekith at the previous convergence (therefore, implying that Odin had either not been born at this point, or was a baby / young child).Yet in Ragnarok, the history revealed between Odin and Hela suggests Odin has been around a lot longer than that, even that he may have been the first Asgardian, but from The Dark World, we know he had a father (Bor) and a grandfather (Buri). And in the first scene of Ragnarok, Thor says he thought his father killed Surtur the Fire Giant \"half a million years ago\". This just doesn't add up.The huge cliffhanger at the end of The Dark World, Loki secretly being on the throne of Asgard, disguised as Odin, is simply disregarded, thrown away as a joke. People had been waiting for the pay-off from that cliffhanger for four years, and it's just wasted.The Warriors Three, Thor's closest friends, are all killed off nonchalantly, and there is no recognition of that whatsoever from Thor. His three closest friends all killed, nothing.Where is Lady Sif? She isn't mentioned once. No concern from Thor, it's like she doesn't exist.Supporting characters from the previous Thor movies are disregarded, no mention of them, bar Jane, who is written out with two lines of dialogue explaining her and Thor broke-up. Again, played for laughs. It renders the relationship between them built up in previous movies pointless.It ruins one of The Dark World's few good scenes. Loki's sacrifice. Completely makes a mockery of it, now it will never be able to be taken seriously by anyone watching The Dark World again.The previous points show this movie is disrespectful of what came before it and the work others had put into the franchise.Loki is wasted, nothing interesting happens with his character this time around, he's just there for laughs, like everyone else in this movie. Bear in mind he is a fan-favorite who hasn't been seen on- screen in four years.Doctor Strange's role in the movie doesn't feel natural at all, it's very out of place, and somewhat jarring. It isn't even a cameo really, it's blatant product placement for his movie. They're hoping people who skipped Doctor Strange will pick it up on Blu-ray / DVD after seeing his scene in Thor: Ragnarok.With Mjölnir seemingly permanently destroyed (There would be no reason to bring it back, as Thor would have no need for it now anyway, seeing as it was revealed it simply helped him wield his power, rather than provide it), does that mean we won't get the long fantasied (and teased in Avengers: Age of Ultron) scene of Captain America triumphantly lifting it in a future Avengers movie?The attempted humor in the opening scene makes me cringe. Half of the gags after that are just people falling over or being knocked over by something, as if it's written by Miranda Hart. Without Jeff Goldblum or the character Korg, the humor in this movie would be painful.There is no sense of threat or weight to anything that happens because of the relentlessly slapstick tone. You just don't care about any of it. If the characters don't take their situation seriously, why should the audience care?The entire population of Asgard seems to be less than a hundred people. Honestly, I think I must be missing something here, it was bizarre.Iron Man Three was originally meant to have an alcoholism subplot, which presumably would have been dealt with in a serious manner, yet Disney shot it down and so it didn't make it past the first draft of the script, presumably because they didn't think it would be suitable for children. Yet, here, in Thor: Ragnarok, Valkyrie is very openly and repeatedly shown with her own alcohol problem, yet in this movie Valkyrie's alcoholism is played for laughs (as is everything else). Surely that's worse? Treating alcoholism as a joke, rather than portraying it in a serious manner in Iron Man Three. Which would you rather your children see alcoholism portrayed as? I don't understand the thinking here.So there you have it, that's what bugged me. Is it a fun movie? Sure, a few moments that will make you smirk here and there, and some colorful action scenes, it's entertaining, but for me, that's not worth all those issues I mentioned. Maybe I'd feel differently if it had a good story or an interesting villain, but there's just nothing of substance to it.",

SPOILERS AHEAD Alright, Asgard is no more and the spaceship they've all left on is probably a lot less of existing than Asgard. Oh and that Tesseract is most likely not on Asgard anymore. For one that place is destroyed but I don't care about that, Lokis face said it all. Okay, that's one major-ish thing to the MCU... This was simply not Thor. Marvel is known and loved for their humor spice in their movies but Thor was never built on them and wasn't meant to be. Thor was and is supposed to be serious with a few chuckle moments, and not a comedy with a very few serious moments. If you ask me, this was Guardians of the galaxy 2.5 with different cast.",

    "reviewTitle": "Rating: A-",
    "reviewBody": "After Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it is time for Thor: Ragnarok to try and finish a very positive year for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), in great fashion.I find the previous Thor movies very interchangeable, they are not exactly great films, but they are still entertaining and enjoyable. However, Thor: Ragnarok elevates that same entertainment to a whole other level ... This is one of the funniest (!) and best movies of the entire universe.Opposed to the previous installments of the series, this one is tonally very different. The amount of comedy implemented in the screenplay and the outstanding humor make this film surprisingly hilarious and extremely fun. It is definitely a marvelous time at the theater and money very well spent.Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) fantastic direction is all over the movie. He is able to achieve a flawless balance between comedy, drama and action, something that most directors have trouble with. Consequently, the pacing feels incredibly controlled throughout the whole runtime. The 130 minutes fly like the blink of an eye and the film never has a dull moment, but it still slows down when it needs to, without becoming boring.Waititi also applies a very interesting, intriguing and unconventional way of storytelling, which truly helps the movie carry itself since the overall narrative isn't really unusual. The visual effects and cinematography are both remarkable but in the last act, the action requires a lot of CGI, which becomes too heavy in some brief moments. Due to the mostly fictional Asgard in the background, when the CGI isn't perfect, it feels like a video game ... Thankfully, I am just nit-picking a couple of shots that, in the end, didn't bother me at all.Eric Pearson's writing is distinctly exceptional with extremely hilarious lines and quite few exposition scenes (the ones that exist don't feel forced at all, except for one or two very concise bits). I believe that he is responsible for a big part of this film's sense of uniqueness and creativity, considering he provides excellent scripts for every character, upgrading each and every one of them and obtaining a more exciting movie.As for the cast, I just need to once again praise Marvel for its amazing choices, they keep nailing every single actor and actress they introduce to the MCU. Cate Blanchett is unbelievable! She is such a wonderful actress that she can portray a super cliché villain like Hela (Marvel's \"default\" villains are something that I honestly hope Thanos can change) and bring a whole other dimension to the character. Thanks to her and an extraordinary script, Hela does not feel like (what could very well have been) a cheap villain.Tessa Thompson is another brilliant casting. Valkyrie adds a new layer of comedy and sass to the film, but her backstory is what gives both herself and Blanchett's character a bit more of depth. The surprise of the whole movie is Korg, a Kronan fighter portrayed by the one and only ... Taika Waititi! You are right, the director of Thor: Ragnarok has the funniest performance of the film! I am far from joking, his lines almost steal the whole show, there isn't a single scene with Korg where I didn't laugh like crazy. It is going to be the audience's favorite, without a doubt.As for the superstars, Chris Hemsworth proves that he is a perfect Thor. Both his acting and body shape are excellent for the portrayal of a god, he is able to be very compelling but also incredibly funny, carrying the story with no slip-ups. His chemistry with Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is palpable and their dialogue scenes are always at a great level of quality, both comedy and story-wise.Hiddleston is great as the evil brother, but Hulk is the one that stands out. The big green guy speaks more in this movie than in all of the others combined and he is freaking awesome! His witty one- liners hit every single time and his action scenes are amazing. There are also some short but very cool appearances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange),  Idris Elba (Heimdall) and Anthony Hopkins (Odin), plus a surprise performance from someone I won't spoil for you.Jeff Goldblum is always great, but his character ... I know this is not going to be a very popular opinion, but I find Grandmaster a bit annoying. Karl Urban has a good performance as Skurge, but just like Hela, both characters feel unexplored and pretty under- developed.My only real issue with the film is something I already mentioned above, which is the story itself. Even though Waititi's uncommon storytelling elevates it, the overall narrative is pretty much the default superhero story. Basically, if you have been alive for the past 10 years, there is nothing about the screenplay that is going to surprise you or blow your mind. Thankfully, the movie is so damn entertaining that the narrative becomes secondary to the all of the action and comedy predominant in the film.In conclusion, Thor: Ragnarok is definitely worth your time and money. It is undoubtedly the best movie of the series and one of the funniest in the MCU. Taika Waititi (with the help of Eric Pearson) molds a cliché narrative in his very unique and humorous way of storytelling, packed with hilarious comedy and phenomenal action scenes. A splendid cast with Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Cate Blanchett at the top of their game pull off some fabulous displays, but it is Tessa Thompson and Waititi (!) that steal the show with their distinguished performances, plus a big green badass that has a lot of funny one-liners.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)",

    "reviewTitle": "This Thor is Thor-some!",
    "reviewBody": "Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old \"save the world\" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.New Zealand director Taika Waititi seems like an unusual choice to helm Thor's third standalone movie. He has the indie root in him and he makes superbly smart comedies with oddles of heart, just watch What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) to see his outstanding oeuvre. Apparently, the Marvel-Disney studios have given him full reins and he went ahead and make a comedy. But how do you inject an indie comedic vibe into a superhero franchise that has not been done before?Essentially, Waititi throws out all the cumbersome weights that hampered Thor and tells a simpler but no less cool story about a superhero trying to get back to his home to clean house. In between he gives Thor ample opportunities to be a beer-swigging beefcake, negotiate some treacherously outlandish situations and strip him off the one thing that makes him Thor, the Mjolnir. At one point, Odin even asks a defeated Thor \"What are you, the God of Hammers? \" that had me laughing till my tears rolled down.The tone is light but no less serious, populated by so many colourful characters in a vivid world trapped in impossible situations. At first I thought the introduction of Hulk in the early trailer is a misstep, but Mark Ruffalo's casting would have been close to impossible to keep under wraps. By giving Planet Hulk comic fans a look-in would have been a better move. The repartee between Thor and Hulk/Banner is so hilarious. No less funny is also the dialogue between Thor and Loki, gone is that \"he ain't heavy, he is my brother\" vibe and this is a Thor that will give Loki a smackdown if he is out of step.Cate Blanchett plays Thor's estranged sister with evil relish and you don't cast Jeff Goldblum without allowing him to be Goldblum. Waititi even voices a gladiator-mentor character named Korg that practically steals all the scenes he is in. Chris Hemsworth hams it up just to a safe degree and nails all the one-liners with an A+. In fact, the whole cast seems to be having fun.Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bullseyes. In the midst of it all, it still manages to tell a super duper cool story of a superhero saving his people. Yet it manages to remain fresh and zip along with a zany lightning pace. What an inspired choice for a director. The risk taken will pay huge dividends. This has superb rewatch value and I already feel like buying another ticket just to catch all the one-liners one more time. This Thor is Thor-some!",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor reinventing himself with the backdrop of an 80's synth",
    "reviewBody": "Thor must stop Ragnarök! It's back again: The Marvel machine. Pumping out more and more movies for you. This movie is what you expect. It's a fun, enjoyable party. It's difficult to hate it, because you realize the movie itself isn't taking things that seriously. This time around they are more self-aware than usual. I liked that addition. It's true that we are so many movies in and you question when it will get tiresome. But to my surprise they shape-shifted the franchise again and got out on top. I never expected that I would like a third \"Thor\" film as much as I did. It's unexpected, but I'm so glad they took some chances by not making the same movie again. If you've had a stressful week or just a bad day, then you will not have a good time watching something that's too dramatic. That's when something like \"Ragnarok\" steps in. It's a nice refresher. Forget your problems for an hour and follow Thor while he jumps around with 80s synth music. The first act is basically a classic \"Thor\" sequel. But things pick up as soon as our hero lands on Sakaar, and the film enters an edgy science fiction zone. It's funny, full of great jokes. It's distracting at first because its obvious how much the humor has been turned up compared to some previous chapters. I easily started enjoying it though. Everyone had fun making this movie and that fun feeling transcends to me as well.Cate Blanchett's Hela is one of those scenery chewing villains. It's classic, but whenever we cut back to her it does feel like an entirely different film. Like with \"Homecoming\", I enjoyed the character interaction scenes more than the action. The final battle feels like an easy training match. It's like we are on autopilot, but then again we get some neat visual elements. Every supporting character is great for this story. The Hulk, Loki, Grandmaster, Valkyrie.. They are all like-able. Jeff Goldblum is playing himself and its fantastic for what it is. Also, the director of the movie plays one of the best new characters. There really isn't much that I can add to the things that everyone else already is saying. It would sound that I'm just repeating every other review for this film. The truth is that \"Ragnarok\" is a very laid-back watch with some retro feels sprinkled in just the right scenes. Know this though; It doesn't strive to become emotionally engaging or inspirational in any way. It won't hit you in the feels as they say. But it's a funny space party where every friend is included and appreciated.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor is uneven but just so much fun",
    "reviewBody": "This film is ridiculous.Lets get that out of the way but really any film with Thor in it let alone any of the Avengers is by definition, batshit crazy.The exception here is that Taika Waititi embraces the Crazy, he fosters it and it does pay off. Remember how bad Thor: Dark World was? Probably not, because like most traumatic incidents you have lost the memory. Where could Thor take a standalone film that was enjoyable and still maintain a link to the Avengers universe? Planet Hulk is where! The Marvel alchemists have taken numerous strands of lore and swirled them together to concoct the breathiest and most colourful confection in their short history. Guardians was funny because the characters were funny while Thor is funny because he is in on the joke.The problem then becomes one of tone. The film is peppering so many jokes and self deprecating nods that the structure becomes uneven which is most seen when the film creaks into Hero mode...you can hear the gears grinding.I am not a huge fan of Hemsworth but he is his most likable here and seems reinvigorated once that famous haircut takes place. The rest of the cast is amazing: Blanchett, Goldblum, Ruffalo, Hopkins and so on. There is just not enough time to go round. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Hela and totally absorbs the screen whenever she is on. The character is underwritten and she still wrings something memorable from it.The film looks fantastic and most especially when they save their money shots for the big battles. Waititi employs a specific colour palette at times such as the Valkyrie battle which resembles a moving Renaissance painting and it is magnificent.The big question will be whether audiences buy into Waititis' gamble. Will they laugh at the NZ accents as Korg says \"Bro\" and \"New Doug\"? If they do this will be a huge hit and a shot in the arm for the extended Marvel universe.",

But damn it was awesome to be blown away like that.For anyone who might not have loved the first two Thor movies, should not let them keep you from seeing this one.It's so utterly different, colorful and funny, it's like Avengers/Guardians mixed together.There was several truly epic scenes, and lot's of awesome action scenes throughout the movie, with lots of humour and soul to it.The story worked well, without trying to be complicated, but enough twist here and there to keep the movie from feeling transparent.If you are looking for a funny and very entertaining movie, Thor Ragnorock won't disappoint at all.Very likely to rank as the best MCU movie yet.",

    "reviewTitle": "Best Film I've seen yet!",
    "reviewBody": "The film started off with more than I expected. A few issues I did notice was that several trailer bits were cut out of the film. The three warriors could have had a bit more to do before dying. Sif should have been in the film as a hero but as long as Marvel still use her. The new characters Korg, Skurge, Hela and Valkryie were very interesting. Another clever thing the film did was put the Doctor Strange post credit scene into the film which was quite clever. This film was way better than the first Avengers. A lot of the films are better than Avengers but people just don't get that. Ultron was better, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 should be rated higher than Avengers so I expect any true fans to rate Thor Ragnarok higher.It deserves 10 or 9 but certainly no lower than 8. Avengers Infinity War I fear may ruin the ending for this film, especially if all the surviving Asgardians are killed by Thanos like the Infinity War trailer showed.Loki and Thor did some funny things like the \"get help\" thing. Bruce Banner remained as Hulk for two years is a bit bizarre. If he does now permanently stay as Hulk then it suggests that his actor is quitting. Korg and Heimdall need to return some day for more action. Now that you know some viewpoints, go and watch this. You'll definitely be pleased if you do.",

    "reviewBody": "I've been rather tepid towards the MCU since the get-go. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed individual films but I've never really been hanging out for the next installment. However, the previews for this one did pique my interest so when I was invited to go see it by some friends I decided to make the effort (rather than waiting for it on Foxtel like I have for the last few).I'm glad I went.The best word for this film really is 'romp'. Its fun, its energetic and its often hilarious to watch. Its a complete tone change from the previous two Thor movies - the second in particular - and its all the better for it. While its a shame that some familiar characters couldn't make an appearance, and some did only briefly, I don't think the movie suffers horribly for their absence. The story holds together pretty well, in my opinion, and I didn't notice any glaring plot holes.Kudos to everyone involved in this film, especially director Taika Waititi. I had a lot of fun watching it and I hope that other people will too.",

    "reviewTitle": "Guardian of the Galaxy : Ragnarok",
    "reviewBody": "I don't know where to start. I love MCU superhero movie. Thor is my favorite after Captain American and Doctor Strange. The first movie was good, the second was outstanding, and when I hear Ragnarok will be the third (and probably last) Thor movie, I'm thrill. I hope this movie gonna be majestic like lord of the ring movie, aaaaand we got this awful movie.Ragnarog should be the perfect conclusion for Thor trilogy, especially when you have Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett in it. F**kin 'Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett !!! Whats wrong with you people !!Dark and gritty theme is not for all superhero movie. And vice versa, not all movies can be made as comedy budy action. Leave that genre to Guardian of the Galaxy. Thor is meant to be be Shakespeare's Norse mythology movie. What makes GOG works, because they able to develop their great characters and the relation between. Hell even GOG Vol 2 know how to pull a line somewhere between their jokes and make me cry in the end of the movie. Thor : Ragnarog is just bad rip off from GOG with plenty of miss-placed jokes.I also disappointed with wasted talents of great actors. You will be fascinated in the first 10 minutes Cate Blanchett. But after that, just bland acting, bad dialogue and the editing is the worst. At least make powerful and touching dialogue between Thor, Odin and Hela, as they're presented by great actors. but noooooo. Hela has no special motivation, no expression, only an unclear desire to rules Asgard and other 9 realm.I don't get it with all people who rating this movie above 5 and said it it the best MCU experience so far. Have you no respect for Winter Soldier, Doctor Strange, Civil Wars and the noise mythology? you guys need to watch more movie. certainly whatever my opinion, this movie will still make a lot of money. and I also have good time. Not great, but good",

    "reviewBody": "Chapter Five of Phase Three in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am a fan of the Marvel movies and a fan of Taika Waititi. I was surprised when he was tapped to direct Thor: Ragnarok and I was even more happily surprised that Taika Waititi kept his voice throughout the movie. The movie feels almost like a reboot that takes the Thor character in a new, less serious direction. The action remains but is surrounded by brighter colors and more campy characters (Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster is a hoot and the wonderful Rachael House brings a sly tongue-in-cheek shade to Topaz). It looks like it was fun to make and it was fun to watch and, as Taika Waititi also bring a sweet emotional edge that resonates by the end. If I have a question, it would have to be \"Where next?\" It seems that Thor is assembling his own team that includes The Hulk and Loki. Will they go off on their own adventures? Will The Revengers return? I hope so.",

    "reviewTitle": "A fun ride",
    "reviewBody": "While I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok, it didn't really do anything new when you put it next to previous Marvel movies. It's a reproduction of the same thing over and over again, with maybe a little better jokes (it's really a matter of taste), which these movies are mostly depending on nowadays. It's sad how creators only think of how to bring masses to the theaters and thus the quality of the creation suffers. The main villain has no originality and all of her actions were predictable, which has happened to most of the superhero villains recently. They're brought in for the sake of only that one movie and get cast out before the end. Except for Loki. But in the end, nothing happens to him. (Tom Hiddleston looked so hot in that all-black suit, though.) The acting was really great on most parts, but Mark Ruffalo was so disappointing. Mostly it was bad script-writing for Bruce Banner, who was a joke in this movie, but he could've delivered his part so much better.I'm mostly bringing out the \"bad parts\", but I really did like the movie. It just wasn't what it could've been. I hope Marvel won't keep using the same pattern for all upcoming movies, soon it won't entertain even the masses they're aiming for.",

Hulk got more screen time, Loki got his satisfaction (no spoilers, but it was great!) and the music was very fitting. 9/10. Totally worth your time and money!",

    "reviewTitle": "Sure. I guess it's fine. It's not high art, but it's a funny brainless comedy.",
    "reviewBody": "Yes, Thor Ragnorak is a comedy first and action movie second. It's weird because it's a movie about of an end of a world, and Marvel turns it into a cartoon. Perhaps that's not a bad thing, but it's not my cup of tea personally, typically. Thor Ragnorak works in the sense that everyone does a pretty good job in the acting department, we've got Cate Blanchett for Christ's sake. If I have a problem with this movie, it's that like most Marvel proper movies before it, it's a cartoon. This is a movie for 14 year old kids, and that's OK, but it's not a thinking man's movie.The other problem is that suddenly cgi Hulk can carry on with coherent conversations, with no real explanation. I guess this where we are at this point.",

    "reviewTitle": "Recommended",
    "reviewBody": "​*THIS REVIEW'LL BE MOSTLY SPOILER FREE. I'LL TELL YOU BEFORE A SPOILER*'THOR: RAGNAORK' - 2017Directed by Taika_Waititi{Hunt for the Wilderpeople}Starring Chris_Hemsworth{In the Heart of the Sea}, Cate_Blanchett{Carol} and Tom_Hiddleston Kong: Skull Island}Plot_Overview: Imprisoned on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds himself in a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against the Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger. Thor's quest for survival leads him in a race against time to prevent the omnipotent Hela from destroying his homeworld and the Asgardian civilisation.So far, I've been disappointed by Thor's solo outings. The first was average at best and I consider The Dark World to be a quite frankly awful movie. Therefore, I had NO expectations going in and ignored the overwhelmingly positive reviews. But after watching it, I loved it. And while I don't agree that it's this legendary titan of cinema that some are declaring it as, I certainly think that it's a VERY fun and enjoyable way to spend a couple hours of your time. If you like superhero movies, be sure to check it out.What SPECIFICALLY is good about this film? The drastic change in tone and style is probably by biggest praise. For me, Thor's previous outings have been dull and monotonous chores to get through so the new focus on comedy was welcome to me. And thankfully a lot of the jokes hit bullseyes. I was laughing constantly throughout this movie; it was a genuine COMEDY.The action sequences in this movie were excellent and thoroughly entertaining. They were also, thankfully, well shot; like the rest of this movie. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is an excellently shot, edited and lit movie. Javier Aguirresarobe does an EXCELLENT job in shooting this movie. Combine this with the jaw dropping effects and 3D and you have one heck of a good looking movie.Chris Hemsworth was an actor I didn't like before. I've always thought he was very one note and had a limited range. This movie proves otherwise. Hemsworth does excellent in the action sequences of this movie, but also has an excellent sense of humour and fulfils the quota for a couple dramatic moments reasonably well. I commend the man for proving me wrong. Accompanying Thor is his quirky brother, Loki, as portrayed by Tom 'Hiddlesticks' Hiddlseton. Hiddlesticks was great in 'Thor', eh in 'Avengers Assemble', okay in 'Thor: The Dark World' and, I'm pleased to announce, great in Ragnarok. Hiddlesticks delivers his best performance of the year(screw Skull Island) and returns to form as the extremely charismatic Loki, that we all love to hate. Mark Ruffallo{Avengers Assemble} also co-starred. Granted, he is Hulk for the majority of the run time but for the moments he's not, he does a great job. Expanding on the decision to include Hulk, I liked it. They certainly give Hulk a lot more personality, and make him feel a lot more relevant to the plot, unlike in other movies. Hulk is now a CHARACTER, no longer a giant green monster that smashes stuff. But don't worry, he is still a good smasher. Tessa Thompson{Selma} also appears in the movie as Valkyrie. Thompson does a reasonable job as this character and succeeds in the action segments of the movie. Alas, I don't think she was that good in the more sombre moments, or at making jokes. Jeff Goldblum is my spirit animal. I love the man as an actor and I thought he was pitch perfect in this movie. He's one of the brighter spots of the movie, despite not appearing in it THAT much.As for issues, I unfortunately have a couple. Firstly, the story was very weak and the conclusion unsatisfying. The concept of 'Ragnarok' is a TERRIFYING idea, especially for the characters on screen. But it's not really that important to the plot. In fact, it's brought up at the start and then once more at the very end. So I don't really see the point in labelling the film as it. The actual story that we got was a very dull one. I wasn't expecting much but the story was so meaningless and pointless that I really wish more time was put into it. Furthermore, I also hated the conclusion of this movie. I was very disappointed about something. The thing I was disappointed about is TECHNICALLY a spoiler so if you have watched the movie, please read on. But if not, then please skip to the next paragraph from now!!!! Right, the thing that I wish happened but did not, was that I wish that Thor_would have been killed off. I know that may seem morbid but it's true. 'Ragnarok' means the end of everything, so what better of a way to have one of the movies that lead into Infinity War, have a main character die. It'd bring stakes back to this universe and give the Avengers something to Avenge. And I think it's be an EXCELLENT way to wrap this film, and Thor's saga, up.Okay, there are no more spoilers no so feel free to read on. My second major issue with this movie is Cate Blanchett and the villain. I understand that Marvel's villains aren't typically good, but even by their standards: this was pretty poor. Hela, who is the GODDESS OF DEATH, is the villain of this movie and guess what she does? Sit in corner for the entire movie and contribute NOTHING to the plot. There was no point to her being there. In fact, I believe this film would've been better without a villain, and just have it be a buddy comedy. Blanchett wasn't AWFUL as Hela but she wasn't that good. It was a passable performance.Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun and a passable way to end the Thor saga. I definitely recommend you watch. I'll rate it 8 'Haircuts' out of 10!",

    "reviewTitle": "Easily the best Thor movie!",
    "reviewBody": "Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint! On the contrary, it actually blew me away. Out of the 3 Thor movies, this is without doubt the best one. Some say the humour is futile and aimed at 12 year olds. Well I am mid-30s and I had some really good laughs throughout the movie. It is cool to see the other Marvel superheroes pop up. If you're like me and not reading too much about the films and what characters they'll feature, before going to see them then you'll get a nice surprise. Also some new characters are being introduced. Korg is bound to crack you up. Everyone does a good job in this film though. Loke is still a bit of a scene stealer, but not like in the other films where he rules the roost completely. 130minutes flew by. As always the CGI is astonishing. And the Valkyries flashback scene is beautiful. Fight scenes have you excited! And frankly, any film that opens and closes with Led Zeppelin deserves an extra star! I have no problem giving Thor: Ragnarok 9 out of 10. It is up there with Guardians of the Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised! A great addition to the MCU.",

    "reviewTitle": "Ragnarok (2017)",
    "reviewBody": "After actually being quite a fan of the previous Thor movies, I was incredibly excited to hear that Kiwi, Taika Waititi would be directing this as his previous films, 'Boy', 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' were just amazing and incredible works of fiction. This film did not disappoint though it did lack in certain areas.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor Odinson along with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner although I thought we could've seen more Bruce then Hulk. Tom Hiddleston is living it up as Loki and gives yet another great performance as The God of Mischief.Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban and Idris Elba are all fine members of the supporting cast and I actually really enjoyed Urban's English accent and his character in general. Elba is just badass in every sense of the word. Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel House, Clancy Brown, Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth also gave great supporting performances. Props to Taika for bringing in Rachel House his long time friend into this role and she had some great moments.The cameos of Hemsworth, Neill and Damon were just incredible. The humour is just sidesplitting and has Taika written all over it. The action was actually very good considering the Director's lack of experience and The Valkyrie sequence was just visually stunning. The story was simple and easy to follow, the film flowed really well and it was just really really enjoyable.Cate Blanchett was a bit meh for me, she was good but she just wasn't very memorable. Tessa Thompson was just boring. Uninspiring and uncharismatic and sadly that was the result of the actress not the writer. Some of the effects were a bit naff, they were a bit ragdolly and some shots in Norway were clearly a green screen. But that comes with the inexperience of a big budget with Taika.The biggest con of this film was what happened to the Warriors Three as they were legitimately some of the best parts of the previous Thor films. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and especially Tadanobu Asano deserved much more then to be unceremoniously killed off with barely putting up a fight. Such a shame, a massive shame.Overall this film is fun, exciting and a really enjoyable experience, there are some minor flaws that tarnish the overall film but this is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a great boost to brilliant director Taika Waititi.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Movie but for ...",
    "reviewBody": "If I had just gone by the previews, and not been so caught up in the Marvel storyline, I probably would have given this movie a miss. Well, it turned out that it was just Cate Blaunchett's really bad acting (or overacting). It seemed as if she really couldn't play a superhero bad guy, or even sit well in a superhero movie. Sure, she may have won and Oscar or two, but this role was certainly not Oscar worthy (not that any of the Marvel films ever make it into the Oscar fields as it is). In fact her portrayal of Hella was so bad that I literally cringed whenever she opened her mouth.Anyway, the film begins with Thor in a cage. He has been travelling the galaxy looking for the infinity stones, with little to no luck, and is now a prisoner of Surtur, one of the Asgardian bad guys. Anyway, to cut a long story short, and after an awesome rendition of The Immigrant Song by Led Zepplin, he defeats Surtur and finally returns to Asgard to discover that Loki is up to his old tricks again. Unfortunately this latest trick has resulted in Odin's death, and their sister Hella being set free to rampage over Asgard. Meanwhile Thor and Loki are banished to a trash world where they (or at least Thor) needs to escape. Along the way he also discovers that The Hulk has also landed up here.This isn't a new story, if fact it is one that I have seen time and time again. The hero is banished from his home and a malevolent force takes over. The Hero must escape the prison, return to his home, and defeat the bad guy. Sounds simple, well not quite, because this is Ragnarok, which basically signals the end of Asgard. While the story was old hat, and Blaunchett horrible, the execution was near perfect. Interestingly the director was born in New Zealand, and when he appeared in a pre-opening scene, I suddenly discovered that he played a minor role in the film (the South Pacific accent stands out a mile, at least where I'm concerned).Oh, I should also mention the jokes. As one reviewer pointed out these later Marvel Movies seem to be really ramping up on the humour, and in part it is starting to ruin them. Some of them are really good, but others of them are forced and unnecessary. In fact a part of it seems to be turning into something like Galaxy Quest than a serious science-fantasy superhero movie, which is actually a little disturbing. For instance the name of the singularity that they used to escape from the garbage world was quite unnecessary. Still, it is a pretty good movie, but I do feel that they need to start toning down on the humour a little.",

    "reviewTitle": "Asgard is Dead",
    "reviewBody": "The concept of Ragnarok for a Thor finale was unexpected and amazing especially since the Norse myths on which the event is based on and the comic arc is based on were great sources for this movie and I think Taika read exactly none of them.The whole grandiose Ragnarok was the 5 minutes Surtur trashed Asgard.As for the characters:1)Thor:Had some development,learned to work together with people,trust in his power and the responsibility of a leader,after 3 movies he just learned that.His attitude towards the whole situation was unnecessary to be honest,most of the times he felt like he either didn't care or was unaware of the real danger.I liked that for once he could stand his own against Hela(for a while),defeated Hulk and the monsters in Hell and Hela's army of the dead.I loved his version of Thorforce(his true potential).2)Hulk/Banner:It finally gave the big guy some development,some conciseness,some feelings of his own,it was good to see him caring for his friends and acting like a sentient being for once.It was refreshing to see the man and the beast coming at terms with their mutual need for each other.I don't really understand yet why Banner would disappear forever if he ever should turn into Hulk again,which he did.So is Bruce forever gone? 3)Hela:Blanchett by far was the best part of the movie,her stellar performance and her look were amazingly accurate to the comics,she looked convincing and acted royal and for once I saw an evil character enjoying her colors and proudly wearing them.Personality wise she was Hela mixed with Angela and Gorr and her powers were mostly drawn from Gorr which while cool was disappointing,her action scenes were cut short,her screen time was unfairly small for the one supposed to be THE VILLAIN of the movie and despite all this she was the best developed character in the movie in my mind.The most disappointing thing about her and Valkyrie was that their epic fight was reduced to a few shots and that was all,not event a small 3 minutes scene.Her getting stabbed or kicked by the asgardians felt weird since she is presented as Odin's right hand,not that it damages her but looks pretty careless for the general who helped conquer the 9 realms.Also Fenris was reduced to her pet gal dog,while nice to see her it was a very stupid decision.Even if her scenes were meaningful,she was super underutilized. 4)Odin:His death was rushed and I didn't't really feel the tragedy in it,his joke about the God of Hammers was good tho,I would also like to point out that I liked him giving Thor that extra boost of confidence to let his power loose for once.I also loved seeing his true face,a war hungry powerful being,who along his daughter knelled the 9 realms into submission but after all,had a limit which made him question Hela's sanity and purpose in all that.5)Loki:Arounded character since the Avengers,he is in the movie to add to Thor's relationship,has a few good jokes and some nice moments.6)Valkyrie:Thessa did an amazing job playing a legendary warrior,hunted by the past who succumbed to alcohol and man hunting to bury her pain and loss but it was weird how she was so easily convinced to join the Revengers.I loved her suit and her action sequences. 7)Surtur:2nd best addition to the movie,it was great to see him in the beginning,his design was superb but even in his weakened state I felt he was defeated too easily.Him being reborn and fulfilling his destiny while facing Hela was pretty epic but short lived,the true meaning of the movie was brought to life by this guy and he was at his job for 3 minutes or so.8)Grand Master:The character seemed like a Psychotic ruler of a trashy planet,didn't't feel powerful or truly evil,just mad,if that was the intention than bravo to Golblum but I feel the best parts that came of the characters like his speech at the end,the talk in the arena,etc were his work and not the script.I liked his way of dressing and how quick he would switch between moods and ironically how he hated violence. CGI:Looked very good sometimes like Hela vs Surtur scene,Hela vs the Valkyrior,Thor vs Hulk,everyone vs the army of the dead but the scene they changed,where Hela emerged from her prison was bad in terms of effects,they filmed a new sequence and then added the old,alley one reaction when she caught the hammer. Soundtrack:It was formidable,especially the Immigrant song added to the biggest action pieces throughout the movie. Landscapes:I was beyond happy with what we got,Skar,Asgard,ruins of the old cemetery below the Throne room,the secret fortress,Hell,Hela's prison,Norway,Sanctum Sanctorum and of course New York. Personal observations:1)Hela as a mix of characters I felt ended up doing more bad for her than good,her comic self is so much superior to this mixed bag they did,it ended up being good thanks to Blanchett's acting.I was so disappointing we got no throne in Niffelheim but a cheap prison set up by her father,powered by his life force. 2)The Asgard scenes while more meaningful than Skar were too short,very insightful but short. 3)Taika's directing was wrong for this movie,the comedy was good but it needed more seriousness,more cosmic action,more Ragnarok and less improvisation,because not everyone is Goldblum or Blanchett to rock at these things.4)I sure Hope Hela takes over Death's role in MCU and we will get her back,she deserves this,both her and Cate unless they want to waste another Oscar actress...",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor Ragnarok has the dumb, colourful bombastic fun cinema sorely needs right now.",
    "reviewBody": "Thor Ragnarok is an absolute ball of a film: it's the MCU's most enjoyable film since the first Guardians of the Galaxy film, and doesn't focus too much on sequel building like previous MCU films. Ragnarok is the kind of film that will appeal to even the most ardently cynical critics of superhero movies; it's stupid but it relishes in its self-aware sense of joy and fun.Ragnarok is eons ahead of Thor: The Dark World in my eyes, and is even better than the first Thor. It's one of those rare 'threequels' that's better than the films which came before it. And considering how supposedly 'formulaic' people are starting to perceive the MCU films, that's saying a lot of great stuff about this movie. Thor: Ragnarok has the mythological scale of something like The Lord of the Rings, the over-the-top fun of Richard Donner's Superman movies, and the extra sprinkling of The Hulk in a gladiator costume to top all this insanity off in a perfectly gorgeous combo. Oh, and it accomplishes the other-world-liness of films like The Star Wars Trilogy.Thor: Ragnarok is the Thor film I've been waiting for easily. It uses the character in a way that we unfortunately had to wait several films for to justify this payoff, but I promise you the payoff is surprisingly satisfying.",

Now do not get me wrong, I am not some crazy fan boy, but I give credit, where credit is due. The film was hilarious and makes this action packed film seem like a great 90's comedy, the one where you laugh at funny jokes and not silly skits or genital reference. The film had really awesome colors and amazing cinematography.The acting in the film was for most part great, few exceptions can be listed, and there were few moments where you can see actor trying to stay in character and they are trying to not to laugh, but it can be excused as 80% of dialogue was improvised, and i guess its just natural reaction of people laughing at something. One of the funniest things of the film was definitely the director, the amazing great job he did directing, as well as his hilarious character Korg and that funny Kiwi accent that makes you laugh every time he spoke.Like I wrote at the start, this is how comic movies should be made.",

This idea won't stand a chance at first, no place for vulnerable, or worse, joking around superheroes.

    "reviewBody": "Let me get this out of my system, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the most fun I had at the movies in 2017. It's one of those movies that had everything. Action? Check. Comedy? Check. Amazing VFX? Check. Hulk being a God-smashing maniac? Double-check. This is definitely the best out of the Thor series. The two previous ones were just generic superhero movies. They weren't bad, they were pretty good. But as soon as you left the theater, you won't be thinking about it anymore.This one, however, wasn't generic. It was different. We were used to seeing Thor as this almighty God with a hammer that nobody can lift. And that's pretty much it. To be honest, I never cared much about Thor. He just wasn't that interesting. But this movie drew sort of a parody of his image and it was really fun to watch. And let's not forget about the Hulk. He is so lovable in this movie. How do you even make a person want to cuddle a 10-foot green abomination? You got to be a genius or some kind. Marvel appointed Taika Waititi to direct this movie. An indie darling from New Zealand that made comedy hits like What We Do in the Shadows, Eagle vs. Shark, and most recently, The Hunt for the Wilderpeople. They all have this unique dry humor that I adore very much. And he brought his signature style again for this movie. I respect this move by Marvel because a lot of studios are afraid of trying new things. A lot of directors were left with minimal creative decisions when it comes to big blockbusters. One of the case was the Fantastic Four reboot by Fox, two years ago. Josh Trank was so frustrated at Fox's dominating involvement in his project that he eventually took his frustration to the social media. Marvel don't want this to happen. They bravely take the risk of giving directors creative decisions. Though sometimes it could result to a mixed bag like Iron Man 3, it could also be a smashing hit like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok.In the end, this movie is a total blast from start to end. It may be different than the other Marvel movies, but I swear there is nothing to regret. Whatever this movie lacks in dramatic aspects, it makes up in its comedy and fun characters along the way. And by today, I know that Thor isn't on my Top 2 Most Boring Avenger list anymore. Though Hawkeye is definitely still there. Make the poor guy relevant Marvel, jeez.",

    "reviewBody": "This movie was a really solid one. It was really funny and and just lots of fun. I didn't like the first 2 Thor movies that much and this is obviously the best one so far and probably one of the best mcu movies. Taika Waititi did a really good job both directing and voicing the funniest character in mcu history probably. His character Korg was probably the funniest character in the movie, his lines were hilarious,he had the funniest accent ever probably. And all the characters were really good. Hela is probably my favorite mcu villain right now. Cate Blanchett is really good in this movie, she is really sexy, funny and intimidating and her little fight with the Asgardians was really fun and cool. Chris Hemsworth was also really good in this he was really funny and had more character to him compared to the other Thor movies. Jeff Goldblum was awesome in the movie. Karl Urban was really good (I couldn't realize him in his character). Tessa Thompson was great. Tom Hiddleston, Mark Rufallo and Idris Elba were great as always. This movie had a basic plot and story that was just fun. Also this movie was visually stunning (not BR2049 stunning but very pleasing in that regard. Had really cool set pieces and action. Soundtrack was also really pleasing with its synth wave-y 80's feel and pretty much the whole movie had the 80's feel with neon color usage. I don't have much problems with it and I definitely would recommend seeing this movie if you have the time.",

It is closer to a comedy infused movie like the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" than it is to the first Thor movie witch I really liked. And while the movie made me smile a few times, I can't help but thinking: is this what the viewers want these days? To see distant, magical worlds on the screen, and magical, eternal, godlike beings acting and making jokes like in some sitcom like \"Will & Grace\" and \"Friends\"? If the answer is \"yes\" then you will enjoy this movie.",

    "reviewBody": "To be honest, I really satisfied after watching this movie because it is really fun, funny, and brings joy to the audience. They succeed again at making superhero movie with comedy style like Deadpool or Guardian of Galaxy. The jokes are good, and with experienced and well known actor like Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Rufallo, and Idris Elba make this movie even better !Marvel did the right decision to make this movie into comedy, because it makes this movie a lot more fresh and interesting to watch. Many people can enjoy this film and will make you feel happy till the end of the day !But, I think at some point Thor Ragnarok is lacking many of important point. The plot seems decent with nothing special in the story, lacking some emotional touch and too many CGI effect involved sometimes make the movie kinda too unrealistic. And I feel a little disappointed with nothing special involved Loki. Loki is somehow that makes Thor movie and Avenger movie more interesting, with his sneaky tricky style sometimes pick a good side or bad side. At last, with the title Ragnarok that means the big war that can brings doom, I expect they can make this movie much better, not only some funny comedy movie !",

    "reviewBody": "When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber take, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the few and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for conquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation with his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, they're stuck in Sakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the next). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion – The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the role's vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos – albeit not far enough. It doesn't extend to properly exploring what he's been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was literally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The supporting players are appreciated, though).This trilogy has gotten a lot of criticism from the onset, some of it deserved, a lot of it borne out of the natural difficulties with making this kind of world work, especially within the gritty, realistic one Iron Man set up. In this entry, Earth is nearly completely absent, and certainly the only human who has screen-time is Dr. Strange, who is also \"beyond\". Yes, Jane Foster, Darcy and Erik Selvig are gone. Broken up off-screen. I hate that. However, with this newfound freedom, this goes full cosmic. The tone approaches Guardians of the Galaxy. It's superior to Vol. 2, but not up to the level of the original. Honestly, a few minor things seem to be there specifically to redo that, and they'd be better left on the cutting room floor. The jokey subversion/drama mix is not as strong as that, nor of the third Robert Downey Jr. solo picture. With that said, relatively little of the actual weight is lost to laughs. This still has gravity and tension. The action is fast, frequent and enjoyable, if also by far the most MCU aspect of this. Many will find this to be bland, not fun, a corporate product. Certainly, there's still a lot of room for diversity and flavor. Fingers crossed that Black Panther will push the envelope there.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. You can go into this completely blind. Stay through the credits. 8/10",

    "reviewTitle": "RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?",
    "reviewBody": "There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.Thor: Ragnarok could've taken itself seriously in the good way, but rather than doing that, it didn't take itself seriously at all, unnecessarily so, and ended up becoming a good thing still, but in a bad way. It's weird and begs the question(s); Is Marvel bending to its fans' will, or is Marvel forcing its fans to bend to its will? Is Marvel being smart and trying to revolutionize Comic Book Cinema, or stupid, and completely losing the plot?Tension is one of storytelling's best and greatest tools, and Marvel seems to be slowly abandoning it, for another great tool, humour. However, is this Marvel's doing, or is it the fans/critics/audience? Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Serious, dark and amazing = $714 Million Box Office, 89% from critics and 7.8 IMDb. Guardians of the Galaxy: Colourful, silly, funny = $773 Million Box Office, 91% from critics and 8.1 IMDb. GotG beat TWS (even though TWS is a sequel, and sequels tend to do more, and, our first look at Steve after The Avengers) in every way according to numbers, but was GotG actually the better film? Batman Begins, Captain America: The First Avenger, Man of Steel and X-Men: First Class suffered similar fates.I love dark, serious, tense. Ragnarok is not that for the most part, but it's still a good watch. There is a lot that is good about this movie, like Thor and Loki's moment in the elevator, but there is also a lot that is bad too, like the fact that for 4 years we've wondered how Thor would react to Loki's impersonation/imprisonment of Odin, and what we got left much to be desired.I think Ragnarok took a very different approach here, and, because of Marvels appeal and reach, it maybe shaking something loose. Also, they could afford to take this route with Thor, as it is the least received franchise, so, they perhaps didn't have much to lose, and more/everything to gain.Ragnarok being this \"light\" also, could work very well for Infinity War, as long as IW is \"hella\" dark. The contrast maybe a very welcomed surprise.I will say this though, if Infinity War takes Ragnarok's path, it will undoubtedly, dismantle its opportunity of being a legendary classic, that has been 11 years and 18 movies in the making.Personally I think that at this point, it may be difficult to judge any MCU film by itself, because each installment is now telling the stories of something bigger, so when you factor that in, there maybe more to what meets the eye.Anyway, in the spirit of judging each on its own merit, Thor: Ragnarok; 7/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Crazy colorful space warrior adventure on the big screen,",
    "reviewBody": "The movie is great. It's a new experience. It does have deep flaws that affected my experience though, but a good enjoyable fresh movie overall.The movie will be a pretty fresh experience. 80 percent of it its outer worlds adventure extravaganza. The planets and designs are incredible. The story is pretty cool too. But...My problem with it it's not what some people have pointed out: The movie is way more of a comedy than the previous two. It's just that Taika Waititi didn't care about taking the plot seriously at all, like in purpose. You don't need to have a loose plot to be hilarious and a comedy masterpiece, look at the first Hangover, look at how high the stakes were in that movie. This movie jumps from point a to b without any regard on how or why, a clear example of this is the Hulk. I have expected since Age of Ultron for marvel to answer how Hulk left for another planet and the answer is \"He just did\"? This is true for all the plot points in the movie. This is just the sort of thing the Russos would have polished completely while keeping all the jokes.I thought the story was full of missed opportunities (Fan Fic incoming, skip if you hate Fan Fic mindsets) why not have the hammer be a limitation of Thor's true power created by Odin to limit him so what happened to Hela becoming evil and unstoppable never happens to him. Making not only Thor's unlocking of his true potential logical but also symbolical now that he lives in a world where his father, the most powerful man wont be there to protect his world. The Thor Hulk fight was cool as hell, even if it was a little simple, it looked incredible. They gave it a definitive space pay per view filter or something. It looked awesome. Hela was cool as well. AND HERE's my biggest defense for the whole movie: Thor himself was great. It felt Waititi designed the whole process of the movie on getting who Chris Hemsworth is, how (Chris Hemsworth) HE sees Thor not how Kevin Feige or Marvel or we the fans have told him to act. How he could actually connect with a Thor he was frankly disconnected from more and more. And I think in this aspect for what the movie is, they had a freaking home run. Hemsworth is fresh again and better than ever. He is awesome, he is Thor and he enjoys it. It feels more like a psychological acting directorial procedure milestone more than a movie merit. But directors should look at whatever Waititi did, because he might have unlocked Chris Hemsworth potential to be awesome to watch on camera. There you have something I can not stop giving props to. So yeah objectively a 7/10 but I would re watch this a thousand times over the 2 previous ones. Also I can not give enough merit on how this movie readjusted Thor incredibly well without him feeling at all like a new character or forced in any way. Its just great overall.I would like to see him in other movies. He could have a serious role in a war movie or a criminal thriller. Hemsworth rocked, and Loki as much as I hated him in the past due to his popularity is freaking incredible as he has always been.",

I am really happy that they went in a different direction with comedy rather then with the boring suffering and seriousness of Thor 1 and 2.Thor has short hair which works, mjollnir getting destroyed does not affect the story, and maybe will be a future objective for Thor to restore it in upcoming movies.They made the Hulk talk which is awesome, this also makes him have a personality and he becomes quite likable.Cate Blanchett is amazing as usual, also heads up for Idris Elba and Tom as usual, he being regarded as a fan favorite.As I mentioned there is a lot of comedy, but its not overused and this time it actually works, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 style, which gives a great tone to the movie.The end is maybe a little confusing, where Asgard is being destroyed. I mean Thor can't defeat Hela, but the fire monster can, but Thor at the beginning of the movie destroyed the fire monster ? Maybe cuz he had Mjollnir ? Whatever. I reckon they needed to destroy somehow Asgard to move the story forward, but they could have done it in a different way.Also very good visuals all around, but heads up for the scavenger trash planet looks absolutely amazing, they they made it look really sci-fi looking, the city, spaceships etc, like something you would see maybe in star wars, or blade-runner, well not actually but sort of, which is kinda good.The action is very good, the story is simple so there is not much not to like.All in all a very good viewing, if you like humour, good action go and see it.I give it a 9/10.",

None of the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I would like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it even worse. If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might be fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and distractions instead of a good story and directing.",

Unfortunately some characters are below the standard we all have come to expect, especially the directors own character Krog. I don't know what happened there at all.But the cgi isn't my biggest concern, it's the humor. I laughed and enjoyed the movie but it was very distracting because it never stopped. So many cheap laughs, it was almost like a spoof more than the real thing. I got the feeling from the clip on Youtube of \"Team Thor\".The characters lack depth because of all the humor and I feel like Marvel are redirecting its movies to fit a younger audience. I feel like the volume of comic relief is what keeps this film from being a great one, just like Guardians Vol.2.The movie is enjoyable, bright, fun, colorful and with an awesome soundtrack. If you like that kind of movie this is the one for you! I miss Thor and Hulk/Banner from the other movies and would have liked to have had a movie with those characters instead of these comedic versions.",

    "reviewBody": "Have to say right away that this was good. The third solo outing for Thor sees him stranded on an alien planet and forced to fight in a contest of champions organised by The Grand Master (Jeff Goldblum - kooky and funny as ever). With Asgard in danger of being conquered by his older sister Hela, the Goddess of Death (Cate Blanchett), Thor must find a way to escape and rescue his fellow Asgardians. This might prove a bit difficult as his opponent in his first contest is....The Incredible Hulk.I've skipped a lot of plot here to avoid too many spoilers. Quite frankly the story is all over the place, being mainly an excuse for a string of jokes and wise-cracking. Some of these don't work, but most do. Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Thor, and he's well supported by the usual suspects. No Lady Sif, though. No mention of her at all.Standouts for me were Goldblum and Tessa Thompson, who adds a bit of spice as a drunken ex-Valkyrie. Blanchett is a very good villain, but somewhat underused. Still better than Malekith any day, though.Basically Marvel have delivered three out and out comedies this year. Hopefully Black Panther and Infinity War will restore some semblance of depth, as the movie is very shallow. This does have some serious plot points, but it's glossed over in favour of the next one-liner.Sleek, entertaining; check your brain in. Now it's time for Marvel to get serious.",

After one point, it gets boring. There is always one super villain in the movie. At one point of the film, this super villain beats our lovely superhero. But somehow, superhero always finds a way to beat the villain at the end. In this paragraph I will sump up all the Thor movies. Thor always gets beat up in the beginning, then finds a way to beat the villain of the movie. At one point, Thor needs help from Loki. Loki can't do anything but help because the situation is so hopeless. But near the end, Loki always betrays Thor.If you want to see the same story, it is fine. You can enjoy it. Just, don't expect something new.",

    "reviewTitle": "80s? No thanks!",
    "reviewBody": "Let's make it clear: It's one of the worst Marvel movies. Not that Thor's saga is famous for being directed in an unobtrusive way, but from Ragnarock's saga, I honestly expected something different. What is perceived by seeing this chapter in the Thor saga and the total annihilation of the epic and poetry of what is a particular Hero and very different from the others, bound in an indissoluble manner to a strong and epic mythology. Everything in this movie becomes glitterous and stupidly irritating, transforming the atmosphere into an Action movie where you need to make the spectator laugh with any kind of joke, taking away the little credibility left to the Thor package. Once my position was clarified on this point, I would like to say that the actors seemed compelling and the special effects perfect without any banging. The plot that has been developed has no big flaws even though it's too trivial, even for a Marvel movie. I only regret that I have not witnessed a convincing and epic Final Chapter, which left room for an annoying comic spot spotted with special effects and music stubbornly 80. # Stop'80",

    "reviewTitle": "Popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",
    "reviewBody": "Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",

    "reviewTitle": "Thor goes wild in this 80's infused superhero comedy",
    "reviewBody": "It's hard to know how Thor acolytes will feel about the God of Thunder's latest solo adventure, with New Zealand director Taika Waititi turning the previous Shakespearian meets modern day blockbuster like first two outings on their heads with his laughter focused/80's infused action comedy that is likely to appeal to a broader audience while also alienating some hard-core fans in the process.It's not like Thor from 2011 and Dark World from 2013 are exactly overly well-loved properties, Thor the character finding a broader appeal and resonance in the Avenger films, but Waititi's departure from what has come before is one of the greatest change of paces for a series I've ever seen.Gathering a passionate if small fan base from his work directing films Boy, What We Do in the Shadows and the critical smash Hunt for the Wilderpeople, those that have adored Waititi's work on a small budget will be pleased to know his oddball sense of humour and playful directing is still well and truly in-tact with a Marvel budget behind his every wish and imaginative idea.Barely taking a chance to catch a breath over 2 hours of runtime, Waititi throws the audience headfirst into Thor's newest life or death outing as the muscled god with a freshly minted haircut (courtesy of a particularly excited hairdresser) finds himself trying to escape Sakaar, a planet run by Jeff Goldblum's camp Grandmaster all the while dealing with his dastardly adopted brother Loki, his angry green friend Hulk/Bruce Banner and most pressingly Cate Blanchett's new villainess Hela, who has taken over Thor's home world of Asgard.It's a multi-stranded plot line but it's all there as an excuse and fodder for Waititi to showcase a new side of Thor whose grown into himself and learnt more about the universe from his time on Earth, as well as a reason to team Hemsworth with Mark Ruffaloo's Hulk as the two share a great on screen chemistry as mismatched friends.As to be expected with a Waititi film, the characters and humour are what makes his features resonate with audiences around the world and he gifts Hemsworth his best take on Thor yet while newcomers to the series Tessa Thompson as feisty warrior and likely fan favourite Valkyrie, Waitit himself doing the voice of rock fighter Korg, Goldblum as Grandmaster and Blanchett as lead antagonist Hela all fair well, clearly having a blast with Waititi's wacky and often inventive situations and executions.As fun and visually captivating as most of Waititi's movie is, Ragnarok still struggles to bring the narrative arc of the story full circle and with Waititi still undoubtedly needing to mould his film into what lays ahead for the Marvel universe, as a whole the final section of the film suffers from a rather forgettable and bland finishing act that feels incredibly lacklustre to what has come before it.Caught up also with the arc of Thor being on Sakaar, Waititi struggles to make the most of Blanchett's Hela and her whole period on Asgard never really gets out of first gear and it becomes an arguable statement that perhaps Waititi took on board to much at once and sections of the film feel the pressure from so many things going on at once.Final Say – Ragnarok is Thor gone wild, a film that's an over the top colourful mash-up of 80's stylings, action tics while on a constant search for the next punch-line.A Marvel experience that will once more light up the international box office and become a quick-fire audience favourite, there's not a lot of lasting appeal to Waititi's film other than the likelihood of it being a guilty pleasure of the Marvel film series but it's one of the years silliest and sensory overloading blockbusters that provides a great bang for your buck adventure and more laughs in a single scene than most mainstream comedies could conjure up in an entire runtime.3 ½ eager hairdresser's out of 5",

    "reviewTitle": "A very fun movie that sheds new light on the future direction of the MCU",
    "reviewBody": "I think that this newest installment in the MCU, Thor:Ragnarok truly solidifies the MCU's new direction that has been commencing in phase 3. Contrary to the previous Marvel Phases this new Phase focuses on a new direction, in Phase 1 we had the origin stories which came together in the first Avengers movie. In Phase 2 we got some further world building in the different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But, other than these entries Marvel's Phase 2 also gave us some experimental projects like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Now in Phase 3 this experimental Marvel is coming in full force. In order for a franchise like Marvel to survive I think this new direction is very important if not necessary, it is very interesting that Marvel is now employing directors that are not necessarily the usual big budget movie directors but rather, directors of low budget movies such as Taika Waititi. Marvel Phase 3 seems to be all about having this ensemble of films with drastically different tones. We've had 2 comedies Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians 2. But we've also went into mystical/fantasy genres in Doctor Strange or serious dramas like Civil War. Not to mention the coming Black Panther that has a very estranged setting. All this is what the New Marvel has become and I think it is perfect. So, after discussing so much on the direction of the MCu I would like to pull the focus back to Thor: ragnarok, I can understand that many people did not like this film for its lack of significance in the greater scene/setting of the MCU. In fact there wasn't much stakes that carry through to the MCU and it seems very self contained. However I think that it is important to enjoy this movie as it is, the fun action sci-fi that is probably the funniest Marvel movie to date. The thing is we as audiences get so much superhero movies nowadays there is a case of superhero film fatigue and having large stakes in every single movie is just going to dilute out tastes. This current way, we can enjoy these characters in their own side stories/adventures and enjoy the big explosive moments when they come together, like a comic book crossover event! What Thor: Ragnarok does so well is that it really redefines the Thor franchise, the character of Thor himself and even the Hulk character. All the while maintaining the sense of fun and adventure. I did enjoy that they further characterized Hulk so he isn't just a raging monster but a simple minded character who has more complexity than is previously perceived. However, the comedy does come at the expense of certain climactic battle sequences and serious moments and this is sure to put certain audiences off. But overall, a thrilling, fun action movie that is sure to evoke certain controversies.",

    "reviewTitle": "Simply epic",
    "reviewBody": "Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.What makes this film so good is its associates. They're not out of place and they're not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, \"Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite.\" Well, overall, I think it's a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it's either a little forced or it's just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, \"Ehh.. okay\", but for the most part, there's some solid laughs here and there.Jeff Goldblum's role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he's pretty good. He's not amazing, but he's an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.There's also a very good 'cameo' like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn't lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it's first and foremost a Thor film.Here's what I didn't like (or, who I didn't like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they're not invalid by any means- she's annoying. She's boring. That's really all I can say. I mean, there's a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it's spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it's one of this year's best.8.5/10",

The poster for this film being one of my favourites of the year.This one contains a lot more action and comedy, similar in tone to guardians of the galaxy. Could be considered a good or bad thing but I liked it. Furthermore some minor characters like Heimdall are expanded upon, which is great because I really enjoy his character. However you need to be a marvel fan to understand some scenes, don't watch this if it is your first as you may be confused. It moves quite fast in the beginning but gradually the pace gets a bit better. Overall I would hold this in high regard, just under Captain America: civil war and The Avengers.",

    "reviewTitle": "Packed with Marvel references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute blast!",
    "reviewBody": "After a total of seventeen films in less than ten years, it's pretty safe to say that Marvel has safely established itself as a popular, successful franchise with its own identity. Known for comedy, references to its other films and comics, and epic, fun action, every Marvel film is at least enjoyable. However, there are some that peak; some that can be included in the best Marvel films - and sometimes best films in the superhero genre. Films like this are the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy - and also Thor: Ragnarok. Definitely a highlight so far in the Marvel anthology, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best, delivering everything you want and expect with a little bit more, brimming with fun, personality and action.Anyone who's seen director Taika Waititi's vampire-comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows will likely expect his inimitable and delightful brand of humour to extend to his Marvel entry (perhaps they've learned since getting rid of Edgar Wright from Ant-Man). It's fortunate that he kept his comedy as it really delivers and fits in well with the comedic personality that Marvel has crafted itself; some of their best films are also, by no coincidence, also the funniest (something DC fails with) and Waititi has continued this trend, while keeping the laughs fresh and genuinely funny. Not that this is a out-and-out comedy - not all the jokes are intended to make you laugh out loud; but they never feel forced and all lend themselves to the personality of the film (and the franchise) and really maximise the fun we have watching the movie. After all, this is a film about a traditional Norse God as a superhero fighting alongside a big, angry, green rage monster - it's important to have fun with it!'Fun' is certainly one of the best words to describe Thor: Ragnarok and it doesn't extend to just the laughs. Other enjoyable elements include references to the wider MCU to excite geeks and non-geeks alike. They all fit in well and seamlessly, not a shoehorned, forced reference or cameo; they all seem organic and make sense to the plot. It's delightful to see Dr Strange, even just for one scene, and to be able to spy glimpses of the Tesseract and a fake Infinity Gauntlet. These add to the rewatch value in a few years time.The crazy, kinetic action really does extend to the whole of the film, from beginning to end, each sequence excellently choreographed. It doesn't shy away from its roots from comics as some of the fights are just as delightfully eccentric and over-the- top. Still they never cease to entertain and, more than that, some are just stunning to behold; the flashback to Valkyrie battling Hela the first time, her army atop a hoard of winged horses soaring through an orange sky only to be cut down by swords and spikes flying towards them in slow- motion. These are gorgeous scenes and Waititi and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe should be proud; the beauty of some of Zack Snyder's superhero moments, but in a good film with much more personality.Most of this movie's joy lies in its characters though; at the end of the day, it might be funny and the action might look cool, but if we don't love the characters, we won't love the film. Back again we get the usual ensemble of returning characters - Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall. All are as regal, fun and charismatic as ever, Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular; it's wonderful to see these actors develop their characters over the last few films into lovable parts in a franchise full of heroes we already love. I feel Hopkins deserved a little more screen time and a chance to get more emotional, but, ever the professional, he makes the most with what he has (and is exceptionally good as Loki pretending to be Odin). Returning characters from elsewhere in the MCU Dr Strange and Hulk also add to the delightful ensemble; it's nice to see Strange solidifying his presence in the franchise after just one film (particularly when comparing to Tony Stark having been in six so far, not including post-credit cameos). It's a relief too to finally give Hulk a decent amount of screen time and for us to get to know him as opposed to just Banner; they're two distinct characters within each other and it's about time we get to see more of everyone's favourite rage monster.The new characters introduced in this film are all excellent worthy additions to the Marvel roster and bring a refreshing touch with them. Tessa Thompson is excellent and charismatic as kick-ass female hero Valkyrie, able to confidently stand among Thor, Hulk and Loki. Korg may not be quite the same character he is in the comics, but Waititi takes this part (who wouldn't give themselves a minor role in the MCU if they can?!) and really makes it his own, saving lots of the quirky laughs for himself. Cate Blanchett too is a particularly fantastic villain, sure to stand amongst the best Marvel villains so far, heads and shoulders above the likes of Malekith and Ronan. She's less generic, less monologue-y and never boring; able to kick ass and be just as evilly sexy as Helena Bonham-Carter was as Bellatrix (or is that just me...?). And of course there's Jeff Goldblum who's as Jeff Goldblum as he's ever been - who doesn't love that?!Thor proves himself to be the God of Thunder and Thor: Ragnarok proves itself to be one of the Gods of Marvel, standing proud amongst the best so far. The whole movie's an absolute blast, packed with references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies. An excellent film to round off Marvel in 2017 - let's hope Black Panther keeps up this level of excellence.",

I just cant pass the fact that images seems to small, spacecraft that looks like flies, people that looks like dummies for being so small on screen and jump straight to looking normal size...anyway those are technicalities.Now to the movie - Am I wrong or is this using the same soundtrack as DC's League? Works! Great sound editing great soundtrack that fits the mightiness of Thor. As always not a lot of swirl around the story line, that continues to be for me one key ingredient for the success Marvel Studies have been gaining with its movies when comparing to the DC Universe. Simple, straight to the point and straight to the action (after all I don't believe people going to watch super-heroes movies are expecting reality) - so the key is then entertainment. And Marvel does this well. It treats super heroes movies like comic books with motion. That's it.The action is good - (again 3D damages some of it) - The Lord of thunder is awesome the special effects plus the sound mix - makes it really entertaining. Kate Blanchet - how do they do it? If being a goddess of death is this hot...nice refreshing act from her... on less common note that the one she's known mostly for...A Hulk that have conversations? straight funny. Valkyrie, nicely played, Loki always entertaining and one Idris Elba that is simply convincing as the one that sees it all...Apart of the 3D, if one thing I would like more - Hulk and Thor fight.It feels this is not the last stance - so looking forward for the next one... if possible 3dless.",

The licensed songs don't work, especially the twice used Zeppelin one. The drama is nonsensical and continuity with previous films is gleefully disregarded. And don't get me started on how much the film shows the comics the finger. Poor Hela, Skurge and planet Sakaar... The film is thus only held together by high production values and the A-list cast who all clearly had fun chewing the scenery. Long story short, watch it once and forget this 2 hour long music video within minutes.PS: Dear Disney, please reboot Thor next decade with the classic Walt Simonson run as the inspiration and keep the fantasy roots.",

    "reviewBody": "To say 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' is best of the three solo 'Thor' films, which it almost certainly is despite its tonal differences, may be faint praise but it's praise nevertheless. This generally entertaining, if somewhat messy piece, gets better once its plot is properly underway, which sadly takes around half of its runtime. At this point, the new comedic approach meshes with the pseudo sci-fi aesthetics to create a truly distinct entry in the 'MCU'. Though this unique approach isn't entirely successfully and is occasionally feels a little at odds with the core characters, it ultimately makes the piece a lot more fun than it likely otherwise would have been. It doesn't quite manage to hit all of its emotional beats, but it does manage to keep you entertained (again, much more in its second half) and is actually a lot more plot-focused than you may expect. It typically does a good job with its characters, although the villainess is a little weak, and is often genuinely enjoyable. It's funny at times, too. The first half is a bit of a slog, though, and the end result isn't as compelling or affecting as you'd hope. Still, it will probably satisfy disillusioned Thor fans, so long as they don't mind changing his DNA a little; it's certainly better than either of his previous two outings. 6/10.",

    "reviewTitle": "Good fun but lacks depth",
    "reviewBody": "As a fan of Taika Waititi I was very excited to see him at the helm of an MCU movie, especially a Thor film the character I have always felt was the weakest Avenger and the one that nobody seemed to know which direction to take in. Waititi fixed this issue and all of a sudden made Thor a more likable and interesting character, Chris Hemsworth providing a hilarious and brilliant performance like the rest of the cast. The comedy created a jovial atmosphere that is not present in most marvel films and this alongside the vibrant use of colour in the film appears to mark a turning point in the MCU.However I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed by this film. Firstly Cate Blanchett was excellent as Hela, proving to be one of the best villain the MCU has to offer, however she was slightly underused. Also the film lacked depth, almost trying too hard to be humorous in certain places instead of focusing on backstories or character's emotions which may have been more effective. Whilst the upbeat, fun of the film was welcome it felt wrong during particular moments that involved the planet Hulk story line, a fantastic more serious story. It was a shame that such a rich story was merely brushed over. Furthermore, Taikia Waititi may need to work more on producing grand, large scale films because, even though the his personal touches were nice, for a film about Ragnarok (the end of everything) it felt very small and didn't occupy the grandeur it possibly deserved. Also maybe just because I love Taikai Watiti's style of comedy I went in expecting more humour similar to that of the character Korg (played by Waititi) however that is just personal preference.Overall this is a fun, enjoyable and visually epic (except on some of the occasions when green screen was used ) film, but for everything good about it there is an equal number of problems with it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Hunt for the WilderThor",
    "reviewBody": "Me'n the missus were looking forward to seeing Thor: Ragnarok. We'd seen the shorts and were impressed. So off we hopped to see it in a manner that holders of the 'Holy Seniors Card' grandly imagine to be 'nimble'. It was made in Australia and has Australians in it and some New Zealanders too who aren't yet famous enough to be claimed as Australians.Odin, Thor's dad has flown the coop and left Asgard to live in Norway and look at the ocean. Thor, and his brother 'Loki the Dodgy', go to visit him via Dr Strange in a bit that I didn't quite understand. Loki, I discovered is/was Taylor Swift's squeeze! Thanks, Doctors waiting room magazines! Next visit I'll try and find out who Taylor Swift is.Odin tells the Thorster that he isn't really the firstborn and he has a big sister and she has been hidden away because she is temperamentally questionable, in the manner of a youth who might feature in the first episode of a 'Kids who Commit Genocide' documentary series is temperamentally questionable. Not only is she super-mean, but she's really REALLY strong and has no need of a hammer; she has attitude! She is called Hela but is really darkside Galadriel who has covered her ears up. Being the firstborn she has dibs on the throne.Thor ends up in a sort of fighting pit run by Wilderpeople and Jurassic Park'ers. I didn't really understand how he got there except there was a drunk chick involved. Doesn't really matter, but. It was pretty funny. Thor meets Korg who is a gladiatorial support act made out discarded drystone and is one of my favouritest characters. They become friends. Thor takes his shirt off and there was a sharp intake of breath from the female audience members, as well as the two blokes sitting behind us. He also gets a haircut.Thor fights the Hulk in the fighting pit. How the Hulk got there isn't explained but it doesn't really matter. It's a good fight too! I want to know who makes the Hulk's trouser because I too have gotten heaps bigger over time and a pair of expanda-pants would be handy.There is a sort of alliance formed and they all head off to Asgard to take care of Darkside Galadriel/Hela. It's not going to be easy. Making up a name for the alliance is tricky too.There is a big battle and 'Immigrant Song' is played. I still think it should be our national anthem. I grandly consider myself a visionary, and as such it is my lot to have my great ideas ignored. I won't ruin it by telling who wins.Is it any good? YessirreeeBob. It's directed by the same person who directed 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and that is a fave. He's a New Zealander at the moment but we'll adopt him soon. It's good enough that I'll prolly buy it on Blu-ray and take it away on golf trips to entertain the drunks.",

    "reviewTitle": "Marvel's most audacious film to date.... and it pays off",
    "reviewBody": "Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe to date. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does so in the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodox character change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thor is pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademark humor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok is more than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevail throughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of a superhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the action and visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. And it has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced the role as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediately making the character much more compelling than the darker and least fun of the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor must prevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end of everything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- on and save the Universe because-as he quotes-\"that's what heroes do\". The \"Revengers\" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), \"his friend from work\", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking former warrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- one should trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearance by the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariously voiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever he popped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point where it becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie, that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is why Thor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.",

    "reviewTitle": "Blackwashing, too many jokes, but very funny okayish movie",
    "reviewBody": "Not sure what to say or think about this movie. It is hilariously fun, and the jokes are well woven into the narrative, the acting great, the action amazing. In almost every aspect this is the perfect action-y superhero movie, but I still do not like it... Out of all the Thor movies, this is probably my least favorite, and that is saying something. The reason? Well, the blackwashing for one. Again we see Hollywood destroy a great character only because they want to get rid of white people. It is racism, and that racist idea of exchanging white characters with black ones leave a bad taste in my mouth. Secondly there are way, way too many jokes in here. And worse: they joke when people are dying. Oh, a planet is destroyed and millions are dying? Well, let us joke about it. And laugh, and laugh... This is probably the blackest, darkest, most world changing movie (or topic of a movie) Marvel has done, but it ends up being slapstick comedy within a buddy road-trip. This movie feels like they've almost made a spoof move about something serious, and I do not like it at all. This movie should have been dark, gritty, serious, and the focus should have been on the blood, the dying, the ending of a world, but instead we get characters making jokes. This is not the movie I wanted and it is not a movie about Ragnarok. This is a comedy movie about friends going on an adventure. No... I do not like it... Also there are tons of topics just glanced over. Warriors three dying? Well, lets skip over that quickly shall we. Sif not in the movie? Nah, who cares. Loki was Odin the last time around, well let us joke about that and move on. I still give this movie a 5. It is very entertaining, it is funny, and the action is mostly fantastic. I can however not get over the fact that this movie should have been something completely different and in combination with bad taste jokes, and the racism, I cannot give it a higher score. Probably my least favorite Marvel movie so far and I hope that this movie does not spill over into other future Marvel movies, because this is how you kill a franchise...",

    "reviewBody": "The movie was a big disappointment, looked like it was only constructed for the jokes (some good, some not that). Big plot holes like Sif not even being mentioned, or favorite secondaries like Volstagg and Fandral being discarded in an unworthy fashion. Why is Hogun leading the Asgard army when he was disbanded by Thor in the second movie to remain in his home-world? Why is Heimdall suddenly a traitor to the crown? Why does Odin pass away (as expected) so seamlessly and without a worthy scene like Frigga's? Oh, i get it, all of this was done to be unpredictable, right?Well... leaving aside that if you carefully watch the trailer, you know the entire movie in advance, the movie was very predictable. Big thumbs down Marvel for setting this tone, and an even bigger thumbs down to all those publication who call Thor 3 a work of awesomeness filled awesome art. I gave it a 1, because there are more than 10 marvel movies out there, and this was the worst of them.",

I like Marvel jokes but this is just too, too, tooo much, like every few seconds and good scenes are ruined with them not to mention unnecessary, stupid (\"funny\") conversations of main or other characters.In my opinion DC will crash Marvel and after this kind of movie it should!!Thank God Justice League is only a week away so I could watch the REAL SUPERHERO MOVIE!",

    "reviewTitle": "Guardians of the Galaxy but with much less interesting characters and storyline",
    "reviewBody": "Much anticipated and hyped Marvel entry this year is undoubtedly Thor:Ragnarok. There are # of rave professional reviews out there already on this movie. I saw it this week, the first day it opened in Korea, and I am absolutely puzzled what the rave reviews were all about. Yeh, it is lighter in tone, yeah, it has more humor, and yeah there a lot more special effects, but nah, sum of all gives us a very familiar movie, some scenes very similar to this year's superhero mega hit, Wonder Woman, and some scenes even more similar to Thor's soon to be avenging teammates, Guardians of the Galaxy. You can tell that Taika Waititi who directed this movie, wanted this one to be something very different and new from the previous two Thor entries, a Thor movie that can standalone, but what we get is a very differently toned Thor entry that is not new or fresh, but rather remindful of Guadians of the Galaxy. In my view, this is a wrong turn of direction for Marvel. First, you don't have Chris Pratt or talking raccoon, nor the cute, adorable treelike humanoid, Groot. You have Chris Hemsoworth who can be funny at times but does anyone remember any of the movies he starred in, aside from MCU? So, this time, it was talking Hulk that played the worthwhile sidekick role, and believe me, Hulk was funnier and more interesting to watch. He saves the movie. Thor-Ragnarok also goes retro in it's soundtrack, but also this is far less interesting, auditory experience, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy. What they share in close similarity is that the whole story mostly takes place outer-space and this is where fatigue comes to play. We like our superheros because we can relate with them, and they team up and help weak, normal human beings in saving the world, while we watch with awe at their awesome superpower. Mostly this happens here at Earth. That is when it is most fun. Outerspace is already covered by the Guardians team and we don't really need to add more. Also, their superpower status gets bit cloudy and can get less interesting, since our creative human minds will always think and may assume that some big, wonderful creatures, monsters, villains, may just well be hiding deep in unknown space, waiting for their chances to crawl out with their undeniable power. The movies's most efforts are poured into showing good vs. evil fight scenes in dark, outer-space, by the means of visual effects. Story is very simple, something kids may like, but adults may find this movie boring and puzzling by the time end credit rolls up. Hela, the goddess of death, is the main villain here, but even with her awesome, evil power, power that is great enough to destroy Mulnir and to hold back her better known siblings, meets a quick death by another evil power who was somewhat easily handled by Hela's less powerful sibling at the beginning of this movie. Hmmm...Asgard is completely destroyed so, we won't see anymore of Asgard's spectacular, golden, futuristic sculptures, and buildings. We won't see Odin either. We may see Asgardians on Earth someday in some MCU entries. Don't know how that will all play out, but my curiosity is not peaking. Ah, I forgot to mention about the grand master, played about Jeff Goldblum. He wasn't all that funny nor did I feel he played the role all that well, but many reviewers seem to think otherwise. The character felt very annoying and forgettable. Because this one was so keen and focused on just being different, the story leaves out most of previous characters, characters interesting, and important enough, from the last two Thor entries. These efforts to be different and wildly light and humorous while having very little story to back it all up, may work this time around. The movie has a plenty of explosions, spaceships, interesting weapons of destruction, etc. but what next ? By being a standalone movie, Waititi has left Thor alone, lost far out in the space, very well disconnected. This will be a costly misstep for MCU to recover from. They will recover this time, but a couple more of these misteps, and MCU will be competing much harder than now, with DC counterpart.",

    "reviewTitle": "Zeppelin, Cate, Goldblum",
    "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. The ultimate cinematic dilemma  how to make the next comic book movie stand out from the (many, many) others? The brilliant answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost – a screwball superhero action film that delivers not only the required alien war scenes, but also a campy villain for the ages in a movie that may be the funniest of the year.For those who prefer their superheroes dark and brooding, this one will be a shock. Prepare for Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster – the most polite villain we've seen in awhile, and one who looks to be straight out of the 1960's \"Batman\" series. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is one of many returning actors/characters, only this time he really gets to flash his comic timing on top of his Thunder God biceps. His love- hate, trust-no trust, see-saw relationship with brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in full force, as is the Bruce Banner banter with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). It's certainly more in line with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY than the previous movies for Avengers. As much fun as Goldblum brings to the party, this is really Cate Blanchett's show. She is the frightening (with a dash of camp) Goddess of Death, and long-lost sister of Thor and Loki, and daughter of Odin (Anthony Hopkins). With a headdress that puts everyone at the Kentucky Derby to shame, Hela's enormous powers are such that she crumbles Thor's mighty hammer with little effort – just to remind everyone that big sisters are renowned for messing up younger brother's toys.Of course, with that title, we know that the story revolves around what could be the end of Asgard. Joining in the fun are: Idris Elba who is back as Heimdall, Tessa Thompson as a master of one-liners Valkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge - rewarded with a wonderful exit scene, Ray Stevenson returns as Volstagg, and rocky alien Korg who is voiced by director Waititi. Fans of the series will be happy to know other familiar faces pop up periodically – one especially magical sequence teaches Loki a quick lesson.In addition to the main rescue story line, the powerful villains, and crazy aliens, there are numerous nods and tributes to previous versions (notably Planet Hulk, and Fantastic Four), and a hilarious early stage play with three cameos that make it clear, big time laughter is here to stay. It's fun to catch the reunions from such previous projects as Star Trek, JURASSIC Park and Westworld. Special acknowledgment goes to director Taika Waititi for hilariously taking the comic book film world down a different path. He's known for his comedic projects like HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (one of my favs from 2016), WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and his work on the brilliant but short-lived \"Flight of the Conchords\". It's still very much a Marvel movie, with visible fingerprints of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. It's also a fantastic adventure film that sets the stage for next year's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, while also featuring the best use ever of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\". So get ready to rock, roll and rollick in a film that is just about as much fun as you can have in a theatre.",

    "reviewBody": "30 October 2017 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Thor: Ragnarok. This is another outing for Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and a very welcome return it is too. Joining him is the enigmatic Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Mark Ruffolo as Banner/Hulk and Idris Elba reprising his role as Heimdall. We once again find ourselves immersed in a gladiatorial contest between good and bad with Thor the central character binding it all together. This outing to Asgard is very much more slapstick than the previous ones and there are many more moments of genuine mirth amongst all the fighting and slaying. Having said that, it in no way detracts from the story and from the core characters that have formed the stable of Marvel stories over the years. Add one Jeff Goldblum as a larger than life caricature of himself into the mix and you have a thoroughly entertaining film. I want to see this again and soon. Oh and people......it's a Marvel film.....stay until the end of the credits!!!!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Good but not 10/10!!! Really!!! 10/10 is a masterpiece",
    "reviewBody": "HOLD ON! before you click \"unhelpful\" let me just say that this movie is great and easily the best in the Thor trilogy however it does have flaws and that is why it is not 10/10. The comedy in this is really great and I like the overall feel of the film, there is a big difference in the plot compared to the other two that makes this film feel much more fresh and enjoyable. However there are pacing problems, some of the actors seem stilted and dull (especially the grand master).The comedy is the foundation of this movie. Whilst The Dark world was a serious mess and the plot was really dark and boring, this movie keeps it very light and playful. Honestly even in the serious scenes there is a slight comedic side that doesn't take away any of the seriousness. Waititi is a great comedic director having done some really great films such as Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do In the Shadows.He has always thrown a bit of New Zealand humor and stupidity into all his films and it really helps to lift the tone and make it a bit lighter which really works well in this film. Honestly I would really recommend his other films as they are all beautifully done. The actors who really stand out in this are Chris Hemsworth who has taken a tone shift with Thor and made him less serious and \"more realistic\" as a hero. Tom Hiddleston is great as always. He has not lost his gift of playing Loki well. The Two I really did not like and Jeff Golblum and Cate Blanchett. Goldblum plays a really dull, goofy character which would work well if Jeff Golblum could play anyone else except himself. All of the characters he plays in every movie are the same character and this takes me out of the film a lot of the time. Luckily he is not a main character thank god.Cate Blanchett plays a very boring baddie with no real personality or charisma. She is the \"goddess of DEATH\" and keeps on saying through out the movie that she is which doesn't add anything to anything. WE GET IT!!!!! you like death no can you try and have a personality. Her helmet as well is stupid as fu#k (which is just a side note of something I hated). The plot of this movie is stilted with random scenes thrown in but I still enjoyed it the story. When the plot was moving forward and the pacing was actually good then the film got a lot more enjoyable. Unfortunately it was hampered by lots of \"random character\" moments. One thing I really did not like is that random characters are in this for no fu$%ing reason!! Doctor Strange is in this for 5 seconds and really does nothing to help that could not have been done by Thor or Loki. It is just a pointless scene that doesn't advance the plot and probably was a studio executive decision so that they can plug more movies.The technical side was interesting but had a little flaw. The CGI was meh with no real use other than to look pretty but that's the problem now. CGI should be used to advance the plot and not really as a \"look at this\" device. If you like CG more than plot and character development then good for you I guess.I loved the music in this, it fitted the lighter tone Waititi was going for and worked well. It is a lovely score of 80's synth that fits the space theme and tone and gives a sense of other world wonder. Honestly I hold music in high regard in film and this is one of the better fitting soundtracks that Marvel have done. It's mostly all score as well with only one Rock song being used to great effect in the fight scenes. The colour palet of this movie is more vibrant than the last two films as well. More neon and less dark colours make this film a lot more enjoyable to watch visually speaking. This goes hand in hand with the music and the cinematography to create something which is really good and different from most of Marvels movies. Overall this film is really good and I did enjoy it, however it was in the end another marvel movie with a few small changes and a great jokes. In a world where we have TONS of superhero films I just want one that breaks the mold and does something different from the norm. The last one to do that was Logan and I wish Thor Ragnarok had done more to fight against the Marvel plot conventions.",

    "reviewBody": "I just came back from seeing it and this movie is awesome man.1) the action scenes were top notch in this movie. Thor has never been this epic in the MCU. He does some pretty epic sh*t in this movie and he is definitely not under-powered anymore. Thor in unleashed in this, I love that.2) Marvel did a damn good job in hiding some spoilers in the trailers.3) design-wise, the movie is totally beautiful. not a single bad effect in the movie. even the scene that changed from city to field looks better on the actual big screen.4) the freaking soundtrack. absolutely perfect. Immigrant Song FTW.5) Hela is totally bad-ass too. powerful, commanding, with just the right amount of scenery-chewing. hell, a lot of characters are so delightfully over-the-top in this.6) great supporting cast too. Valkyrie owns everything the moment she enters the movie. even Surtur was pretty darn hardcore. and Korg is freaking hysterical. Man I loved Korg!7) the movie's got a lot of humor. that may be a problem to some..but, when it's time to take things seriously, the movie does exactly that. specially towards the spectacular third act, when real sh*t is going down, the humor dials back a ton. It is only during the Sakaar portions of the movie where most of the humour is, not without several moments of sincere character interaction of course.8) I thought what they did with the \"Ragnarok\" part was kind of genius. this may not be the Winter Soldier of Phase 3 they told us, but it does make some significant changes to the overall MCU, or at least, the Thor section of the MCU.9) The pacing of the movie was perfect. Plus there wasn't a single scene in which I felt bored.Overall this was one of Marvel's best films for me. It would definitely be in my top 5 marvel movies along with civil war, winter soldier, guardians of the galaxy and iron man 1. I'll probably rank it at 2nd or 3rd!!!",

    "reviewBody": "I don't know who wrote the script, who directed it and who produced it, but they should be fired. The Thor movies has always had a slightly darker tone and well written stories to help character development. This movie has none of that. Storytelling has been shoved to the side to make way for unnecessary comedy, reducing every character to the comic relief. Loki and Bruce Banner are two complex and sad characters who were only in the movie to satisfy fans and add more jokes.Had it not been for the brilliant acting of Tom Hiddleston and Cate Blanchet, I probably wouldn't have seen the entire movie. This is not a superhero movie, this is a badly made action comedy. And as a long time Thor comic fan, this hurts my heart to write.",

    "reviewTitle": "Welcome to the Marvel Cosmic Universe!",
    "reviewBody": "Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells you'd guess yourself after seeing the trailer, is that it's nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The tone is completely different. In fact it's probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with it's straight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvel's Cosmic Universe in full swing. How this makes me feel isn't quite so clear. As I said, I really didn't mind the other Thor movies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days, seems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and he's on top, What We Do in the Shadows form here.Ragnarok is jam-packed full of jokes and gags, and every single one of them lands with aplomb. From Thor asking Surtur to pause while he helplessly spins around at the beginning, to the Grandmaster declaring a tie in Sakaar's revolution, each and every slither of humour is guaranteed to earn a laugh. It's typical Waititi humour; awkward, modern, and using juxtaposition to great effect. Korg, a large being made of rocks, talking about his revolution failing because he didn't hand out enough pamphlets hits so hard because it's so against what you'd expect from that kind of alien.Waititi's also in his element with running jokes, coming into a franchise nearly twenty movies in full of continuity to adhere to, poke fun at, and address in one way or another. Loki taking Odin's place in Asgard is dealt with swiftly, with a couple of gags thrown in, including surprise cameos. Hulk disappearing at the end of Age of Ultron is addressed with heartbreak and a couple of touching moments between Thor and Hulk/Banner. And Hela knocking over the Infinity Gauntlet in Asgard's vault because it's \"fake\" was a great way to plug such a tiny yet significant plot hole.Despite how humorous Ragnarok is, it doesn't shy away from more serious themes and ideas though. Thor's companions in the Warriors Three are dispatched of quickly and without remorse, Hela raising an army of the dead from the Asgard crypts is a pretty dark idea, and of course there's the whole Ragnarok thing. Not only is this movie one of the funniest entries in the MCU, but it also has some of the biggest stakes so far. By the end of the film, Thor's life is permanently changed in a massive way. But Ragnarok is still not perfect. It still doesn't quite reach the heights of either of the Guardians movies or Winter Soldier. It's opening act feels a little messy, rushing through plot points to get to the meat of it. Thor's tied up in chains at the behest of Surtur, now he's in Asgard unveiling Loki, now he's with Doctor Strange looking for Odin, now he's in Norway bracing for Hela's arrival, now he's on Sakaar about to face the Grandmaster's champion. It's almost all rushed, and some of it feels pointless. Like, Doctor Strange's role is completely unnecessary. He's just put in for an Earthling presence in a movie that frankly didn't need it.Hela is also another in a long line of lacklustre MCU villains. She's the first female villain to pose as the main antagonist, which is great, and Cate Blanchett is perfect for her (I think I'm in love). She has an interesting backstory, but it's never really developed. Hela ends up just becoming another two-dimensional mustache- twirling villain with a plan that's flawed from the offset and no motivation beyond just being evil. Her being the Goddess of Death is never really capitalised on either, outside of her resurrecting dead soldiers of Asgard's crypts reasonably early on.That said, almost every other character is great. Thor's sense of humour is brought to the forefront with some surprisingly great comedic chops from Hemsworth, without it taking away from his more serious moments. He's still Thor despite the tonal shift around him. Likewise, Loki is the same old Loki, with his tricks and betrayals, and his history with Hulk is played up to perfection. Valkyrie and Skurge both enjoy character arcs that help to develop them, and both Tessa Thompson and Karl Urban make their mark on the movie. Waititi even gets to add some of himself into the movie as Korg, who promises to steal every scene he's in. And of course Mark Ruffalo manages to play Hulk completely by himself for the first time and gives us the best Hulk we've ever had.Ragnarok is another part of Marvel's current hot streak, and here's hoping it continues just a little bit longer at least. It's a massive tonal shift from the rest of the Thor franchise, feeling closer to the Guardians franchise, which is a win/lose depending on your point of view. The music is a step in the right direction, utilising Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song really well, as well as adding some 80's synth/video game music underneath Marvel's standard, dull strings arrangements, but it's largely still unmemorable and unremarkable. The visuals are fantastic, employing a style closer to Snyder's approach in the DCEU than Marvel's usual grey realism, which I personally consider a massive plus. But of course it's the humour that keeps Ragnarok afloat, and the massive stakes leave me begging to find out what happens next. I give Ragnarok a high 8/10. Easily the best Thor movie so far.P.S. Where was Sif?!",

From the opening scene to the last scene, there is hardly a 20 second time period without some silly jokes and they really get stuck on them.Why oh why do they have to ruin a film like this with endless silly saying and stupid things? Where are the serious and more somber moments in this superhero film where they have to do dangerous life- threatening things to rescue the world? All serious scenes were plastered with silly things they said.Spoiler part here: The only serious scenes were the ones where Thor talked to his real dad.The Hulk was talking too much and said really silly things and that 'stone-man' fighter with the high-pitched voice was ridiculous.I was looking forward to this movie and the trailer made it look really powerful and serious, but it was a film about clowns with capes.",

    "reviewTitle": "Good Fun, But Is That Enough? (SPOILERS)",
    "reviewBody": "Thor hasn't had a great track record in terms of films. I get the feeling the first film is met with a strange contention, some think it's a good time, others thin it's okay, I personally really like it, I like it's Shakespeare-esque qualities and I'm a sucked for inner family conflicts, the like of Thor and Loki. The second film, Thor: The Dark World, is generally seen as being pretty 'meh' and understandably, it's pretty lifeless and without any real interesting plot points at all, it's a totally missable movie. Now comes Thor: Ragnarok, a pretty serious storyline in the comics but played a bit more for comedic effect here.Ragnarok is a good time, of that I won't contest. You'll get a feel early on the film has been 'Guardian of the Galaxy-ised', that is to say it's approaching the film with a more comedic and tongue-and-cheek attitude rather than serious and Shakespearean vibe of the first film. The comedy, for the most part, works well in the film. It doesn't always land perfectly, and especially in the first act I felt it felt a little off, but once you really get into the swing of it it works well and lands well and the actors land their lines well.But I can't fully endorse Ragnarok, and it's annoying, because despite how the comedic tone works I'm not sure it really aids the movie or the story it's trying to tell. At the beginning of this film Odin meets his end, with Loki having been sat in Odin's place for far too long it is now Odin's time to pass, and he does, but now Hela, Odin's firstborn daughter, returns to take the throne and lead Asgard to war and domination, a conquest Thor must avert, but Thor is weaker than Hela and is thrown from Asgard so now he must pull together a team to thwart the new evil. It sounds fairly Shakespearean-esque, and if you watched only the scenes in Asgard with Hela you might think that's the way it's going to spin. Hela's scenes are dark and brooding, serious, whilst Thor on Sicar (I think I spelt it wrong?) are light hearted and carefree. It's a feel I think clashes harshly because there's some real stuff Thor has to deal with here.Firstly, Odin is dead, and secondly, Loki is essentially to blame for said death. I was expecting some kind of serious confrontation here. Everything that Hela is doing in this film is nothing Loki hasn't already done - Loki did try (did?) blow up an entire one of the nine realms in Thor 1. Thor also though Loki was dead whilst Loki instead just sat on Odin's throne and sat about. I think the film may have benefited if had worked more towards what Hela's character seems to push towards. Hela speak of the lies of Odin, of how Odin was no 'great and honest' king but also a tyrant. It would have been interesting to have a three way struggle between the siblings of Odin about the treatment they were given under their father, the sins of the father, if you would, that would make for some very interesting a deep conflict.It's problems like this that prevent me from really liking Thor: Ragnarok, in many cases the motivations and characterisation of characters makes no sense in context to their actual character. The Valkyrie decides to help Thor, for no reason I can discern, I completely get why she wouldn't help him. Loki seemingly decides to ally himself and stand by his brother by the end, despite the massive discussion they probably still have to have. It doesn't add up to me. In a medium that I love due to its story and character I think there's much wasted here, much that could have been developed into an insightful, more character fuelled film.On a side note, I am worried about Marvel's dramatic swerve towards humour as of late, I get that the company wants their films to be light hearted and fun, which is completely fine, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier pulled off a really good story whilst incorporating comedic elements and still told a good character driven story, I was hoping the same for Thor and I hope to see more stuff along those lines from Marvel soon.",

    "reviewBody": "With the third Thor movie called \"Ragnarok\" which means the apocalypse, you would think it would be the darkest entry in the saga yet. Not so!By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in his special vision and kiwi humour into the mix, this an amazing, kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride. Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is wonderfully funny, Tessa Thompson as Valkerie, a hard-drinking Asgardian warrior is a total breath of fresh air and Korg (played by the director) is just as eccentrically wicked as Rocket Racoon. The Age of Ultron got criticized by some for including a bar scene where the Avengers have fun with Thor's hammer. But to be honest, I'd always welcome the Avengers having a good old time, making jokes, bantering and insulting each other in the process.Doctor Strange makes an appearance, which is amazing. He takes his job as the Sanctorum's gate-keeper very seriously and has no time for Loki's mischief. A very welcome change indeed in these troubled times.",

    "reviewBody": "I saw many people in the internet complaining about the \"fun vibe\" of the movie. Well, guys, IT'S A MARVEL MOVIE! What the heck are you expecting?! The trailer sell me a fun movie, and this was exactly what I receive. Didn't you?Look, I'm a really critical about the excess of jokes in the Marvel movies, I really believe that in some of them it doesn't work at all (like Civil War, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange). But here in Ragnarok for me was a improve, comparing with the other Thor movies (the first one suck, and the second it's fun, but not that much too).Chris Hemsworth has amazing comic skills (way better than his \"dramatic\" ones), Mark Rufallo is great too, Tom Hiddleston, etc etc (you get it, the cast is great).The movie isn't a master piece (like Joss Whedon said), far away from that, they bet on the save (again), but this time works. Cate Blanchett is F#CKING INCREDIBLE on the movie! And that is a improve when you think in the MCU (you know... the majority of the villains in the movies suck). So, in short, for me Ragnarok is another very entertaining, fun, and well done Marvel movie. Doesn't will win an Oscar or something, but it's good, and mainly, a lot better than the first two.",

    "reviewBody": "*Just to note, \"Do You Find This Review Helpful?\" doesn't mean if you agree with the reviewer's opinion or not, but rather, it means if the review actually describes the film, and what are its pros and cons. So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I brought that up just to tell you that Marvel is still standing strong until today, even at its seventeenth film, and the fact that this is one of my favorite Marvel films.I'm glad the film takes Thor differently. Unlike the first two, which are both mostly boring and trying to be very serious, this film is fun, and energetic.The best thing about this film is that it's probably the most fun entry of MCU. It's 90% filled with humor. Almost all of the main actors in the cast steals the movie. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, and even Taika Waititi as Korg. They were all very interesting and funny characters, thanks to these actors that did great in their roles.I also have to give props to Taika Waititi for his direction. The film feels very fast-paced (in a good way), energetic, and fun overall. The reason why it's different to most of what MCU gave us so far is that, again, it's filled with humor most of the time. It's just a straight up superhero-comedy film. And that's what makes is MCU's most audacious film yet.Sure, the previous MCU films may have humor, but throughout the film, it's laughs and giggles. Though it sounds bad that the film is mainly comedic, the way the comedy is executed is very well done.Another plus for me is the action is very well-executed and visually stunning. The film is very colorful, and I loved the animation for the closing credits.The only flaw for me in this film is that there may be a lot of jokes in some scenes. There's this one joke, and then there's another. In return, the viewer wouldn't handle all of it. It's a minor flaw, but I thought of it, so I had to include it here.Overall, it's a very fun and colorful film. Easily the best of the Thor films, one of Waititi's best works as a director, and one of MCU's best efforts.Final Rating: 9/10 <> A",

    "reviewBody": "Every time I go into the movies I feel like playing the lottery. I hope for the best but really don't know what I'm getting and I often feel disappointed in the end. This time it was not the case. Marvel universe movies have been my favorites from the very beginning of the story and Thor:Ragnarok as the latest edition has surpassed my expectations. I was hoping for a another good entry in the Marvel universe but this was on another level entirely. This movie is fun, funny, full of action, well acted, fits the story perfectly and what is most important it feels fresh and original. It is different from the other Thor and Marvel movies and stands firmly on its own while still being a bridge to the culmination of the Marvel universe. It's light tone is in my opinion a good set up for the final chapters of the Marvel universe which are no doubt going to be much darker and more dramatic. But make no mistake Thor Ragnarok is a serious movie with a thin layer of drama and darkness as well. It's not perfect but it's flaws are tiny and barely noticeable when compared to the big picture. Without a doubt in my top 3 Marvel movies for now.",

    "reviewBody": "The plot of this hulk sized film is imprisoned the mighty Thor finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against the Hulk his former ally. Thor must fight for survival and race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his home and the Asgardian civilization. They actually did it they did a Planet Hulk film i had to say that because it pretty much is Planet Hulk and i have to say that to me the story was really well told and really well paced which is to be expected since the film is only two hours and ten minuets long.Returning as New Doug (if you don't get the joke then watch the film) is Chris Hemsworth , Tom Hiddleston , Cate Blanchett , Idris Elba , Jeff uh ah uh ah uh ah Goldblum , Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. I have to admit i loved the chemistry between Chris and Tom at this point they might as well be brothers and the same goes for Chris and Mark i'd say the only one that Chris doesn't have chemistry with is someone i can't mention since it's spoiler. The rest of the cast do a solid job i know we make a lot of fun about Jeff Goldblum but damn he was good in this film you can tell that he was having a blast playing this character and i hope to god that we get to see more of him in future movies and once again Tessa kills it i loved her in Creed and i love her in this i'm calling it right now she's going to win a lot of awards.It's taken them awhile but finally Marvel have created another great villain at least in my eyes Hela was a true badass. The only real gripe i have with her is more personal then anything and that's the fact her motivation wasn't that clear others might think the opposite but that's my opinion and she can actually beat people up and be an actual challenge for our hero and i hated her helmet.Wow this film has a lot of humor and i do expect a lot of it to go over people's heads especially with the music choices but this film had me laughing out loud and hard we all know of the scene where Thor and Hulk first meet up and that's still funny but for me one of the best jokes in the movie is what happens after that scene and if you've seen the first Avengers movie you'll know why i laughed at that scene.Honestly at this point there's no point in my even talking about the CGI because we all know it's going to be good so instead i'll jump right into the action which honestly was rather refreshing just due to the fact that not a lot of it boiled down to who can hit who the hardest and there's a badass scene with Thor near the end of movie which i was going to make a joke about but then i thought it might be a spoiler.Damn the soundtrack for this film is really something and when i say the soundtrack i don't mean the score used by composer Mark Mothersbaugh.i mean the songs they inserted into the film i kid you not one of the scenes uses \"Pure Imagination\" from Willy Wonka while not one but two action scenes use \"Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin and i was OK with that.Overall i can't say this is the best Marvel movie because i think there are better movies but i can safely say that this is the best Thor movie and the best Hulk movie for me this film gets an 8.5 out of 10.",

    "reviewBody": "This is the third standalone Marvel 'Thor' film, a swashbuckling superhero fantasy that continues directly after where 'The Dark World' ends. The premise is that Asgard is in peril, Thor's objective is to prevent the destruction of his home planet. This film introduces the villain 'Hela', she is the Goddess of Death, she is also Thor's sister, who has been in exile for many years and appears to be a very powerful character, possibly more powerful than Thor! During a particularly colourful action sequence, Thor is transported to a remote 'dump' of a world, on the other side of the Universe, this planet is full of rubbish and discarded people and is ruled by the weirdo 'Grandmaster' outstandingly played by Jeff Goldblum. In order for Thor to get back, he first needs to beat the champion gladiator, who happens to be the 'HULK'. This is also the point where we're introduced to another excellent show stealing character, 'Korg', voiced by the director Taika.The entire film is full of relentless adult comedy sketches and humorous dialogue, which was inspired by the humour and success of Guardians of the Galaxy. With a great soundtrack, this is a hugely entertaining film that balances humor with drama. Highly recommended.",

    "reviewTitle": "The Best Thor Outing Too Date",
    "reviewBody": "One of the biggest challenges with an ongoing series is crafting a story that is on par or better than the prior offering and that the characters continue to grow so audiences do not get a rehash of what they have seen before.With \"Thor Ragnarok\" Chris Hemsworth has returned for his third solo outing, and fifth outing overall as the heroic Asgardian warrior Thor. This time out Thor is on his quest to track down the Infinity Stones and finds himself plagued by visions of Ragnarok: a legend detailing the fiery destruction of his home of Asgard.With an action laden opening, Thor believes he has ended the threat and returns home to find his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), has been sent to Earth and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assuming his place.Thor ventures to Earth with his brother which sets a series of events into motion, the result of which unleashes the long imprisoned Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans the subjugation of Thor and Asgard. Naturally Thor is not going to put up with this, but finds himself mid battle knocked out of his transit home and on a remote world called Sakaar.As if being stranded far from home is not enough of a challenge, Thor is forced to become a gladiator for the erratic Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), whom Loki has managed to charm and become a part of his inner circle.As fate has it, Thor becomes matched with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and must find a way to survive and make his way home before Hella can destroy all that he holds precious.The film is the best of the Thor films and it is engaging from start to finish. There is a significant amount of humor in the film but it does not feel forced and is very appropriate to many of the scenes. The film also has plenty of action and the blend between comedy and action is deftly handed by Director TaiKa Waititi who never lets the film become a parody of itself nor take itself too seriously at times. He knows when there is a time to laugh and when there is a time to be deathly serious.This allows for a deeper and more enjoyable and engaging Thor than has been previously seen. He is not as one-dimensional as he has been in the past as the strong, quick to anger muscle that I would love to see explored in further outings.I had worried from the trailers that the movie might be more of a video game as it seemed heavily dependent on retro style CGI and camp humor which made it seem like something out of the 80s. While there are elements of that, the film mixes the old and new to create one of the most authentic and enjoyable comic adaptations seen to date. It continues the winning formula of Marvel Studios and of course, sets up the next outing for Thor in \"Avengers: Infinity War\" as well as the larger Marvel Universe as we a whole. The film also has some great cameos and I am curious to see how the addition of the newly introduced characters will be explored down the road. The return of Hiddleston was also a real treat as he is so good as the mercurial but always sly and dangerous Loki that he commands your complete attention every time he appears on screen.Marvel has once again set very high standards for comic based movies and has again delivered another winner that you will not want to miss.4.5 stars out of 5.",

The plot may be simple, the characters may be undeveloped, but I didn't go into the cinema for a Oscar best picture nominee. The constant jokes, the beautiful visual effects, the amazing soundtrack, even better than the Guardians I think, are just the things I paid for. Totally worth the money and the time. And spoiler alert, some may wonder how the fire monster beats Hela but Thor beats him at the beginning of the movie. My theory is that the fire monster is brought back by the eternal fire at the end, so it makes him much bigger, hence maybe more powerful.Anyway, one of Marvel's best movies, the very definition of entertainment, I will see it in cinema again.",

    "reviewBody": "EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THOR : RAGNAROKThe Movie was a total waste of time, the Hulk was shown to be with a child's mentality getting upset and doing children's moves. No explanation was given as to how the quinjet ended up on Sakkar, Age of Ultron in the time line comes after Thor the Dark World so even the explanation that he drifted into a spacetime bridge due to the conversion phenomenon is out of the question. The Hulk is Talking and no explanation is given for that he seems not angry anymore so why is he in Hulk mode in the first place.The second Stupid thing that the Marvel People didn't Even Bother to check was that in Thor the first movie Loki opened the Bifrost with the staff of ODEN (you can check the scene if you don't believe me) So how in HELL did Hela miss that knowing that she might be as ancient as Odin himself, not even once did she witness him open the Bifrost with his Staff?? They went to conquer the nine realms together so not knowing that is totally DUMB, if Loki knows it Hela should know it too.Before Loki screams \"BRING US BACK\" Thor say \"NO\" as if Hela couldn't reach Asgard without the Bifrost....? She appeared from HEL her Dimension into Midgard Earth without any Help why would she need the Bifrost to get There??? And if She so desperately needed the Bifrost for her conquest for the sake of argument she should have taken the sword the minute she landed on Asgard.AND How come the Devils ANUS gets you Directly to Asgard?? and if it does every time shouldn't the Grand Master know about it ? He seems not knowing what Asgard even is while his brother deals with Asgardians ??The Zombie Army is Stupid, they are slow, they are killable by simple asgardian citizens, what kind of an army is that?? Hela could conquer an entire planet by herself why would she need the dead weight.If Hela can't escape her Exile why did Odin send the Valkeries to finish her off in the first place \"knowing how powerful she is\" that was a dumb move on Odin's side. And we still don't know if Hela is bound to Exile because Odin is holding her off or how precisely because as mentioned before she can travel through dimensions at will. And if that's the case then she should be able to escape when Odin is weakened... say when he falls into the Odin sleep..?How did Odin abandon his responsibility as Protector of the nine realms and just went to Norway to enjoy the view is completely IDIOTIC and when confronted by his sons he just says \"it's your time now\" and vanishes?? He isn't injured, He is still capable of doing wonders but no he chose to turn into golden dust... That's pretty helpful thanks Odin.This movie went out of the frame that the fans and the Marvel Studios agreed upon, We expect action, a coherent story and good visual effects, if one of these elements is missing the movie sucks and frankly you should fire the scenario writers who put together Ragnarok because it's the Stupidest Movie Marvel Has Ever Made.",

    "reviewTitle": "Unexpected fun",
    "reviewBody": "This is the not the film I was expecting. As the third entry in the \"Thor\" franchise, I anticipated a traditional super-hero movie like the previous two: lots of drama and threat and the occasional humorous one-liner. But this is actually the funniest by far of all the works in the Marvel canon (now 17 films) and has clearly been influenced substantially by the commercial success of the two \"Guardians Of The Galaxy\" movies which came out in between \"Thor: The Dark World\" and \"Thor: Ragnarok\". This makes for an immensely entertaining outing but inevitably dials down the tension. As well as different writers, we have to thank for the new style New Zealand director Taika Waititi who additionally voices the granite character Korg who could have stomped straight out of a \"GOTG\" film.As always with super-hero movies, we have lots of noise and colour together with splendid sets and effective special effects, but ultimately what makes this movie work is the cast. As well as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as brothers Thor and Loki, we have the wonderful Cate Blanchett as their gorgon-like sister Hela, another enjoyable female actress Tessa Thompson as a Valkryie, Mark Ruffalo as the Incredible Hulk, and the delightful Jeff Goldblum as an unlikely- looking villain called simply Grandmaster. The plot is rather confusing (but essentially Ragnarok = the destruction of Asgard) and the humour sometimes juvenile (a cosmic star gate is called \"the Devil's Anus\"), but the whole thing is such F-U-N.Marvel movies always have a teaser clip at the end and this time we are treated to two: one early in the credits and one at the very end. The humour never stops.",

    "reviewTitle": "Satisfying muscular myth and light humor.",
    "reviewBody": "\"Asgard is not a place, it's a people.\" Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but eventually not the physical land. It's all about the people, a gentle allusion to the plight today of immigrants who have become travelers while bringing home with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry the Biblical heft and a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC for that matter, is the cultural mash up that reflects our civilization's abiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e., becoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity we were meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and self deprecation is a welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre is maturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is not just a hemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with the death of his father, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and my families, but in a figurative way, just the same with its challenging relationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they still fight with broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awareness that battles will never really be different because they reside in the mind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs and lows, our greatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or Willy Lowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and films, and although the time and technology may differ, we still love and deplore our bloodlines as we work our way to dusty death. This Thor carries too many explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms are satisfyingly entertaining and sometimes downright allegorical.",

I enjoyed most choices in the movie even the ones that are most criticized such as easy discarding of Fandrall and Volstagg. For me those simply were used as highlighters of how Hela is in a league of her own that's simply beyond challenge. The ease they let people perish (akin to hawkmen charge in Flash Gordon) along disco music was also one of the factors where I enjoyed that nostalgic fan ride.",

    "reviewBody": "So far, they have managed to make a good(ish) balance of light and sinister moments, but in this instalment, the scales tipped waaay too much into the silly jokes side. I'm not an expert on Ragnarok, but I remembered it to be the end of Asgard, it's gods, and most of the \"world\" as we know it. Death, destruction and sorrow, followed by a thin ray of new hope over the ruins. How did they think that they can turn this into a joke, and that it would work? Throughout the story,the embarrassing jokes just kept coming, to the extent that often I felt I'm actually watching a silly sitcom. Don't get me wrong: I expected some light-hearted fun and banter during the build-up to the final battle (what Ragnarok is supposed to be), but then I thought it would turn into a dark, epic, moving, bloody but heroic finaleinstead, we have some of that, but broken to pieces by cheap jokes. Honestly, I'm not sure even a 10 year old would enjoy this mixture. The missus really likes Thor (big surprise there, I know), and even she was looking at me in pain many times, rolling her eyes. I know some of the previous two episodes had some silly moments, but trust me, not like this: it is a whole new level.The critics seem to love it though, explaining things into it I don't see in there (I'm sure it is my fault). I liked the previous two Thor movies (with all their obvious flaws), but this, I'm not sure if I will even buy later (as I used to, to complete the set on the self). For me, this was really disappointingPS: I actually liked the \"80's science-fiction\" look & feel (sets, costumes, music) present in many of the scenes, though it seems to be disjointed (again...) with the previous movies.

The Director has so much fun with the material he forgot to take it seriously, and, by the same token to give it any kind of weight. Loki was a major threat in many Marvel movies and now is either a C Grade villain or B Grade sidekick; worlds explode and this basically only the source of a joke, etc. Nothing is taken seriously so it's almost too light.

    "reviewBody": "The latest THOR is spontaneous and freewheeling, especially while on a planet straight out of the famous Roman Gladiator arena where, as the trailers spoiled long ago, the anticipated fight between two seemingly indestructible AVENGERS, Thor and Hulk, takes place. Which leads to one of the film's best devices...Thor, without his hammer, is nearly as vulnerable as a mortal human albeit a very strong one up against an assortment of odds, making for a non-stop planet-to-planet roller-coaster ride...Visually a hybrid of the intentionally campy 1980's FLASH GORDON and the first GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY while shadowing plot-elements of STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS and with more sleek, colorful rainbows than we've yet seen on Asgard — which has been taken over by a deadly, invincible sister (looking like Maleficent dressed as a reindeer) that Thor and the mischievous Loki never knew they had — there's a cool retro-techno score to back up the pulsating arcade of explosive action.And while it's understandable that, with such a fantastical superhero, levity is needed to ground the audience, there's a fine line between Fun and Funny, and RAGNAROK, featuring sarcasm-guru Jeff Goldblum embarrassingly overdosing on his own style — breaks it once too often: Superheroes all have powers and/or skills that can, whether built-in or created, turn on and off. But the constantly witty, wry one-liner styling of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark (inventor of 'Starkcasm') has infected Chris Hemsworth's THOR to the point that his third solo film, while enjoyable enough, nearly drowns itself in self-deprecating parody.

    "reviewBody": "Thor:Ragnarok, the very movie that got crazy praise, the movie that everyone is gushing over it. The movie that people claim it \"brought back\" the fun in superhero movies. But is it really worth all of this high acclaim? I can safely say that it doesn't. Just another over- hyped, generic garbage from the MCU. And to make stuff clear, no I don't hate \"fun\", and I am no elitist (be it as a comic book fan or as a movie Buff). I simply want a quality movie, no matter how its done or constructed. And this movie cares less about all of this and focuses way too much on humor that it overshadows other important elements of the movie. To explain myself, I have nothing against escapism. When the movie sells itself and doesn't lie about its nature (whether its a heist, a simple action film or just a comedy), I don't go there expecting a cerebral masterpiece. But I don't expect it to be a mindless filler that's sole existence is to kill 2 hours of my time without any other context or purpose whatsoever. So far, the movie is getting insane reputation, having high praise almost as other great comic book movies such as logan and the dark knight. But for these two movies, I can understand why logan and the dark knight get such high acclaim. Both completely reinvented the superhero genre in their own unique ways, by giving moral subtext and an engaging story. Thor:Ragnarok doesn't care about such. And yet its praised for its entertainment factor. Now ask yourself: is there really anything worth of such praise aside from how much \"fun\" the movie is? I still don't understand the praise for this movie. Its entertaining, but it is a bad movie. It's another proof that the MCU cares more about avengers movie than having a satisfying film. It exists solely to fill in the wait for infinity war.It suffers what other comic book movies do: there is no conclusion or a satisfying ending. They're focusing way too much on the next projects. Character development is almost non-existent, as well as character relationships. All of the relationships rely on cheap, gimmicky comedy instead of seeing real characters interacting with each other. None of the characters feel natural. In fact, it feels like the actors are merely cosplaying. And as usual, marvel shows they have no respect for the source material. I'm no comic book elitist, and my knowledge of Thor isn't that of a die-hard one, but I know enough to spot when the character is bastardized. I'm sorry, but a Thor who cracks jokes left and right while being captured and his home world being destroyed isn't who Thor is. Thor was more of a noble warrior who speaks in ye old English, almost Shakespearean style. The previous movies failed not because of the tone, but because the writing and acting was lazy, thus you don't care about him. And this movie suffers pretty much the same problem. And the other stories, as well as the hulk and Valkyrie, feel wasted. They are used unwisely. Both deserve better than just being in a film. In fact, planet hulk should have its own movie, not being a pointless subplot in a Thor film. And about the whole \"fun\" aspect, I hate that. I hate that mentality in which the movie is praised simply because its fun. Getting all of this love just because you are entertained. But aside from that? The movie has nothing to it. Its being treated like its the first fun comic book movie we had in years. Have people forgotten about guardians of the galaxy vol. 2? Or was it generic and forgettable that people DID forget it? Overall, over-hyped garbage that doesn't deserve any of the praise. One of the worst marvel movies, and the most disappointing movie of the year (even though I had no expectations)",

    "reviewBody": "Since its first movies, Marvel is consistently going for more and more jokes, punchlines and witty remarks, in its movies. Why?They have solid characters, solid scenarios and a ton of money behind each movie. Why do they keep making each character the equivalent of Tony Stark or The Joker, where, no matter the stakes, they have to pull a joke from somewhere? Why don't they let the gravity of the situation weigh in to the viewers and they have to lighten up the mood, every damn minute? Not to mention the number of times one of the characters makes a reference to something, completely out of character, like when Thor says \"Oh my god\", or when they refer to Hell (from the Christian mythology)...Seriously, didn't anyone from the producers read the script and voiced ANY objection???",

    "reviewTitle": "A descent into total collective madness",
    "reviewBody": "There is an unprecedented general approval of MCU movies without any regard for how good these movies actually are. In all fairness some of them are truly brilliant (Avengers, Winter soldier, Iron man, Guardians of the galaxy), and some of them are just, in lack of a better word, bad (Incredible hulk, Ant-Man). In the last couple of years we have been served with extremely bland and generic action movies that lack any grit, power or, in some cases, story (Doctor Strange, Guardians of the galaxy 2, Spider-man Homecoming, Civil war). All of these movies are fun, the time spent watching them is extremely fun. But, regarding the historic importance of the cinematic universe importance (and the fact that no one so far has managed to do the same even though attempts are being made), is fun and entertaining all you aspire to? Herein enters Thor: Ragnarok.The trailers boiled ones blood. The adrenaline of the music, visuals and characters blew one away and you simply couldn't wait to see it. The end result was a question: \"What happened to the movie the trailer promised?\"Let's break it down a bit.1) Story. There are several actually, and not one of them makes any sense. The Surthur story is seen in the beginning and the end of the movie, destroying one of the most powerful characters in Norse mythology/Marvel comics. The Hela story is underwritten, shabby in execution and a waste of a spectacular character (played beautifully by Blanchett). The gladiator story is a disaster in every possible way. The irrelevance of the story or unprecedented, the way it slows down the progression of the Hela story is just criminal. So, the viewer is presented with multiple ongoing stories that do not have any relevance in regard to each other, they are stuffed together without any real idea of how to execute them. The result is that the story we were promised was never actually given to us.2) The humor. That lighthearted approach to every situation, no matter how dark or difficult it is, that Marvel has been doing lately (e.g. Civil war), has in this case actually killed the movie (Civil war does have a redeeming ending that is as dark and gritty as it needs to be). Comedic segments serve as wonderful relief in many ways. In horror movies, if implemented correctly, can be a great layer to the whole experience (e.g. IT). In dramas they can create mixed emotions in viewers so that they actually laugh instead of cry. The key - IMPLEMENT CORRECTLY. Ragnarok not only overused comedic elements, it used them in all the wrong places. So, when one is supposed to feel sorrow - laugh; when on is supposed to feel excited or filled with adrenaline - laugh etc. etc. etc. There was only one moment in the entire movie that was relieved of the humor - the bridge and main fight scene between Thor and Hela. But, even in the very end when all hell breaks loose (literally), we can't fathom the gravity of the situation because yet another character dropped a pun or a joke. So, enough is enough, really.3)The portrayal of characters. So, all of the above can be blamed on bad direction (the terrible way of telling the story and not knowing how and when to interlock certain story segments) or bad screenplay (humor EVERYWHERE). But, the way the characters were portrayed was unbelievable. At the end of the movie one thing is certain: this movie was made just to depict where Thor and Hulk were during the events of the Civil war. Why and how certain story segments occurred - no answer. The criminally underused Antony Hopkins, the lack of screen time for Blanchett or Elba (the only actor that took his role seriously, God bless him), the absolutely unnecessary Dr. Strange cameo or Karl Urban's forgettable and cliché character just proves that bundling together too many characters that have no relevance to the story(stories in this case) doesn't make it fun or good in any way.All in all, Thor: Ragnarok just continues the general downfall Marvel movies have established. The once brilliant concept of a shared cinematic universe is now a money making machine that has no real idea of where it is going or how it is going to end. At one point it will have to end, my concern is do the executives know that. I was really excited for Infinity wars, now I am just scarred to death they are going to do the same thing they did to all of the movies in the last couple of years.Congratulations, enjoy a bland action movie, have a great laugh to the end of the world, because that's what the end of everything (Ragnarok) should feel like - lighthearted",

Cool, you've seen the action and fights in the movie. You want comedy? Hey you'll get some of that but it'll quickly not be as funny when you realize that's all they're going for and you're constantly barraged with one liners.

    "reviewTitle": "A more funnier Thor than you're used to...",
    "reviewBody": "It is a lot more funnier then its predecessors. To be honest, I was a little worried going in that it was going to have the GOTG 2 treatment, and it was going to be too joke-y. (Not that I hated that movie or anything, I still really enjoyed it). But anyway, I am glad that it still managed to have scenes that were dramatic or heartfelt. It was a nice balance. And surprisingly Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing. He was a highlight of the film for me. Tom Hiddleston of course is great at Loki. Cate Blanchett plays Hela as very dark and sinister. Shes probably not my favourite villain, but shes up there. I liked that she was kick-ass and actually felt like a true threat. I liked that we got more of Hulk that wasn't just him smashing stuff in fight scenes. Jeff Goldblum kind of just felt like Jeff Goldblum playing another zany character. I mean, his character was fun but I don't feel like he truly transformed or anything. I liked Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. I especially liked her introduction scene. But somehow by the end when it came to big boss battle, she didn't really shine. I remember other characters moments. Thor being able to summon lightning without his hammer is really cool, and is something I look forward to more once Infinity War arrives. And I also quite liked that there was an overall redemption arc to the film. One part of the film that did bug me/didn't make to much sense (and this where I will get a bit spoiler-y) is that they make this claim that the fiery demon guy(forgot his name) is the only one who can bring Hela down. And when he is released, Hela does have a \"Oh Crap\" look on her face. And yet, Thor destroyed him earlier in the film. So why is that Thor cant take Hela down himself? I also didn't like Hogunn, Fandral and Volstagg were barely in the movie and got killed off almost immedietely. I think their characters deserved a bit more. The CGI for the most part was really good, but there's a particular scene that takes place in Norway (or was it Finland?) that was a very obvious looking green screen. And this is a minor quibble, but its not believable that Hulk's pants stay on. I know this happens in all the other movies (and they obviously cant show Hulk's bits) but at least with past movies, I can buy that he wears baggy or bigger sized pants and just belts it so it stays on. But in the film, they had this running gag that his pants are very tight (and had pull at his crotch a few times), so it just feels extremely silly that they stayed on. They should have just done away with it. But overall, I did really enjoy this film. Im not sure where I would rank it. I mean we're 17 movies deep by this point, so I could use a re-watch but I think this is one thats higher up.",

To date he's been the villain in around 4 Marvel movies and all the time the heroes think Loki will be on their side and guess what? He ends up tricking them and somehow gets away. I mean there aren't any variations to his character to provide something different. It's just the same character villain again and again. Tom Huddleston is a boring actor. I hate his soft spoken voice. He thinks he's doing Shakespeare. And why are they making a Thor movie look like a Custodians of the Cosmos (i.e. Guardians of the Galaxy) movie? The Thor movies had a Viking vibe to them which I liked. Also severe under usage of Heimdall. I'm not running to the theaters for this one.",

I loved the music. I even accept the story, though they really bastardized a lot of the comic book mythos, which I expect anymore. There was a great, deep story to be told here that was ruined by inappropriate humor. Now disclaimer: I don't enjoy the humor that is so popular in a lot of NZ and AUS material, so this movie was not for me. If you like simple jokes and bright flashy action with underused and somewhat pointless characters, then this could be for you. My expectations were at a higher bar and it failed.",

    "reviewTitle": "Hippy Hippy Thor",
    "reviewBody": "Thor was always a tricky comic book character to bring to big screen. Kenneth Branagh managed to do it by making the first film as a mock Shakespearean action film fuelled by dysfunctional family dynamics. He was instrumental in casting Tom Hiddleston as Loki.Unfortunately Thor:The Dark World was rather dreary. Marvel has taken a left turn for Thor: Ragnarok by getting inspiration from The Guardians of the Galaxy film by underpinning the film with comedy.King Odin has been sent to a nursing home on Earth by Loki who has pretended to be Odin at Asgard. Thankfully Doctor Strange felt Odin would be more at home in Norway.When Thor returns to Asgard he sees through Loki's disguise. When they go to meet a dying Odin, he tells both of an evil older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett) who will return and cause chaos.Thor:Ragnarok is a rather trippy neon lit 1980s infused adventure film. In some ways it nods a hat to movies like Big Trouble in Little China.Thor is both aided and thwarted by evil brother Loki who sees Thor getting a painful bashing that he endured in the hands of the Hulk who is the main star in a planet where beings take part in a gladiatorial contest.It is Asgard and some of the regulars from there who get short shrift, characters such as Heimdall. Karl Urban who plays Hela's henchman called Skurge is rather wasted of his talents as we know he is capable of giving much more. Even Blanchett is rather bland as the villainess, Hela. In some ways the film is rather dark and brutal but it is always undercut by the comedy.",

    "reviewTitle": "a director totally in sync with his cast - one of the funniest movies of the YEAR, nevermind MCU",
    "reviewBody": "In brief: this was a damn space craft full of fun. Thor Ragnarok is Douglas Adams by way of Jack \"King\" Kirby, both from his Thor run and other (MANY) space fantasy comics in look and brawny, iconic feel (and this time, maybe the first time, Larry Lieber gets a screen credit!) Waititi is stupendous with his actors and they give back in kind.If only the action wasn't so been-there-done-that (or maybe it's the CGI being so overwhelming that it consumed the actors in some shots). That said, this continues the goofy-but-serious space-operatic look from the Guardians movies, and it ups the stakes from the previous Thor movies - it's *easily* the superior of the three, the most human and with a more interesting villain(ess), though I wish Blanchett were in it a wee bit more, not to mention Waititi himself playing a rock monster with a droll sensibility - so it stands out from the pack very easily. Even Thor gets an arc this time, which was fairly typical if there at all, and I don't even know if there was one in The Dark World (that movie was so forgettable I didn't recall what happened to Odin at the end of that story.Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner gets fun stuff to do throughout (he gets to talk, a lot, this Hulk, so take that what you will), and everyone gets a moment to shine, from Tessa Thompson to Karl Urban (mostly his arc is serious, but he starts off the movie with a terrific jokey scene), to even the whoever-she-is that has to work as the Grandmaster's secretary. It's not as emotionally full of depth as the Guardians series, but I did also appreciate where the movie ends up as far as the fate of Asgard; even if it's a small way, it felt like Marvel taking a real chance - the first time they did something like that since Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin, and like that it works - and while, again I must stress, much of the action doesn't carry much consequence, as a comedy with that spirit of Adams (from Hitchhiker's Guide AND Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, I almost forgot till a friend reminded me Odin and Thor and Loki were in that), it's firing on as many cylinders as the other MCU movies this year. It's a breezy, wild space adventure. It knows its audience, and it gives winks and nods to how silly it all may be, but when it needs to be serious it can do that too (or at the least, Cate Blanchett gets to chew on some scenery, but not all of it, if you catch my drift - she knows what she's in and is having the time of her life in a way I haven't seen since Crystal Skull).",

    "reviewBody": "THOR RAGNAROK REVIEW :The one thing i always liked about Thor series is that they never gave a long run time film, they always believed in keeping it short and grippy. Thor Ragnarok wins half race here, rest half is won by Terrific Visuals, Massy Writing and throughout tight screenplay. Film has a quick beginning and may be that's the point where film keeps you hooked and it remains same till the End. Doctor Strange's Cameo is Pleasing. The villain Hela is powerful and her back story is well written. Thor's \"Revenger\" team is Great, you see some more addition in Marvel's superheroes list. That anticipation of Hulk's entry worths the wait as he arrives with the bang. Climax is well crafted, every thing is used perfectly by Director. Background music is decent. Cinematography is Excellent. Visual Effects are so good that i declare this one the as the most Visually spectacular film of Thor Series. Editing is Brilliant, no chance to point a finger. Direction is Very Good, could have been better but when everything looks good i don't think it's fair to talk on minor mistakes of director. Overall, Thor Ragnarok is a Perfect Money Making entertainer from Marvel. Marvel just can't disappoint with a good Superhero film. If you're a Fan of Marvel's superheroes films then Thor Ragnarok is a MUST SEE for you. Classes and masses both will love it, especially mass lovers. No doubts, Film will be a huge success at box, get ready for Highest Grossing Thor Film. Go for this one and have a BLAST, i guarantee you will not be disappointed. 7/10* by me, i would have loved to give 8/10 but i think a massy film does not deserve that rating even if it's too good.",

    "reviewTitle": "God Of Thunderous Applause and Comedy",
    "reviewBody": "He's big, he's flashy, and he has locks of hair and a body that slays many. Yes, he's Marvel's own Thor, and tonight is his third solo movie's release date. In hopes of smashing the box office, Disney has brought the God of Thunder back with a darker twist in hopes of reigniting the magic of Marvel. Welcome to Robbie K's movie reviews and tonight we analyze, observe, and share my opinions on yet another movie to hit the silver screen. Let's get started!LIKES:Special effects: Disney's team is the master of money, which entitles them to deliver a dazzling display of cinematography magic. Thor Ragnarok is another example of how the Marvel universe can be brought to life. Dazzling special effects fill the big screen in the form of nature's wrath, flying projectiles, and monsters of various designs. While certainly not the most realistic of the graphics, Disney's group crafted fluid animation, colorful spectacles, and of plenty of speaker blowing sound effects to go with it. If that's not enough of a selling point, then how about the special effects of Chris Hemsworth's body will be happy to please the eyes of many female fans, plenty of shots according to my friends tonight. Action: Remember the first Thor where there wasn't much battling, but more babysitting? Yeah, well the Thor group managed to take the action of the avengers, and kind of cram it into this movie. Ragnarok, spares no time diving into the action, and keeps it spread throughout the entire 130-minute run time. The darker themes of the story certainly allowed this, and thank goodness, the directors took hold of the opportunity. While Thor certainly gets more of the seat gripping battle scenes, this movie provides the other cast some rather impressive scenes. And finally, Marvel has broken the cycle of lame villains, giving Hela (Cate Blanchett) some bite instead of just barking. With all these contenders and the edginess of the movie, you can rest assured that the dullness of Thor has been broken. Comedy: By far though, Thor Ragnarok's biggest selling point is comedy the series is so famous for. The third installment is perhaps the funniest of the bunch, trading whiny complaints of assistants and naked walks by old professors Instead, the writers decided to fill the movie with a lot of diverse comedic ploys to keep the chuckles coming. Slapstick humor, well-delivered one-liners, wacky catchphrases, sarcasm, and banter to no limits. Ragnarok has all this in fantastic amounts to keep the movie as fun and entertaining as possible. Even better, is how the comedy is also integrated into the action scenes, showing that the writers in Marvel haven't lost their talent after all. The music itself is also funny comedic relief, sounding like something out of an 80's video game, in all its dazzling, electric keyboard glory. DISLIKES:Missing Character Stories: Ragnarok has a lot of good with it, but one thing that was slightly annoying was how some of the characters lacked complete background information. Valkyrie in particular was a little rushed, leaving out some key things that could have made her an even deeper character. Even Hela herself has a rather shallow story, glazing over what could have been some cool sequences for some overdramatic banter about how hurt she was. Outside of Thor and Loki (who have had movies to weave their tale), the backup characters seemed slightly diluted in the grand scheme of the movie. Over-hyped Action: Don't get me wrong, Thor had plenty of excitement to amp up the pace and excitement of the movie. Unfortunately, the sequences are rather short-lived, or more comedic than actually exciting. With the bar set high for me, I was hoping that the scenes were going to be more intense, filled to the brim with fist punching, lightning throwing, and sword wielding incredibleness. And just as the momentum was building, they dropped it for more comedy and banter between Thor and some other character. This particular scenario was especially true for Hulk Vs. Thor, which while entertaining, was disappointing on the exciting action part. While the conclusion managed to build up my hope, it too didn't have quite the zing I had hoped. Despite all this though, I still enjoyed the action. The VERDICT:Truth is, Thor Ragnarok, while being dark, is one of the more entertaining films of the bunch on so many levels. It's got a fast pace to keep things going, action to liven up the scenes, a villain who doesn't entirely stink, and comedy to keep the dialogue fun as well. If you're like me you will be laughing almost the entire movie, but if you are ones preferring over the top slapstick and innuendos out the wazoo, then slow your roll for this movie. While I would have loved to see more character development (and use) of the secondary characters and a little more excitement in battles, truth is this is one of the better Marvel films in a while. And of course, with all the special effects, this reviewer can't help, but recommend you see this movie in theaters. Beware thoughthis movie is a little more inappropriate for younger audience members not only due to the more adult comedy, but also for the language used in this film. Exercise caution please when choosing this film, and plan a babysitter if you don't want little ears hearing course dialogue. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",

    "reviewBody": "This was a fun and exciting movie to watch. I was fearful that it would end up that the 3rd Iron Man movie, but everything about it was entertaining. The jokes were plenty and the director didn't drag them out beyond an awkward moment. Action scenes were very well planned and thought out as well. HIGHLY recommend this movie! Best Marvel movie I've seen! LADIES...you WILL enjoy this movie! ;)",

    "reviewTitle": "Really funny if sometimes to its detriment, but certainly had me laughing.",
    "reviewBody": "The Thor films have been kind of average so far; can a quirky New Zealander change all that?Thor: Ragnarok is the third film in its own series and Thor's fifth appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. This time it's directed by Taika Watiti and also features the Hulk as a main character. For starters I'd like to say I love Taikia's work; his film Hunt for the Wilderpeople is hilarious to me and any interview you watch of his is a joy to behold. He has a very unique style of film so I can see why Marvel chose him to inject some energy and humor into this series. And he does do that. Ragnarok is the most entertained I've been while watching a Thor movie but it's not without its problems.Story-wise, there is a very quick set-up. You can tell that Taika and producer Kevin Feige wanted to completely dismantle what had been built up in the previous Thor films. I can understand why they wanted to do that but just seeing mythology, characters, and arcs that have been established since 2011 be wiped away or brushed under the carpet was a little disheartening, and this was all during the first act. It was very quick and we were going from scene to scene and location to location very quickly mopping up old plot threads and setting up what this movie was going to be. Once that had happened, and Thor was on the planet Sakar, it became more enjoyable for me. The rest of the movie showcased Taika's style of humor perfectly and had me laughing out loud plenty of times. It did seem a bit like two films at times with one set on Sakar and the other on Asgard as the story kept flipping from one to the other but I was entertained enough with the characters.Chris Hemsworth has always played Thor brilliantly and we get to see a lot more of his comedic talent here. Mark Ruffalo is always a highlight of any film for me and seeing him here was great both as Banner and the Hulk experiencing this mad Universe. Tom Hiddleston's Loki, of course, appears again and although the character has perhaps lost some of his popularity since everybody loved him in The Avengers, I enjoyed seeing him because I like Tom Hiddleston as an actor. Two new characters I absolutely loved in this film though, were Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster who is hilarious; Goldblum barely has to act, his own wacky charisma comes through perfectly. And Korg, voiced by Taika Watiti himself had some of the best lines. I'd definitely say the characters were the best part of this film for me.In the end, I'd say I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok. The story is pretty basic and some of the green-screen wasn't great during the re-shoots but I loved the aesthetic and the characters. I laughed a lot too even though I felt some of the emotional beats were lost due to quick jokes. I still look forward to following Taika's work and I'm looking forward to seeing where the character of Thor himself is taken too.",

    "reviewBody": "If you are a die hard Thor fan, you may be sorely disappointed in this movie. Unless your idea of Thor is one of the Marx Brothers. The movie is fun. Key word, fun. It is a comedy throughout the entirety of the movie. It really doesn't take the comic genre seriously but that might be what makes it enjoyable to watch.",
