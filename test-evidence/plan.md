## Test Evidence Plan
As testing is still in progress, the following should be captured and included in the test-evidence folder once all milestone implementations are complete:

1. Verbose test results: Output from `running pytest -v`
2. Code coverage results: Output from running coverage run -m pytest && coverage report -m
3. GitHub actions showing all tests passed
4. Some examples and outputs for various test categories (integration, mocking, equivalence partitioning, fault injection, and exception handling). Can be done before milestone implementation is complete.
