M4 - Final project + new features (10%)
Due Friday by 12:59a.m. Points 100 Submitting a text entry box, a website url, or a file upload
This milestone represents the final stage of your project. Your submission should demonstrate the complete functionality of your system, including its implementation and deployment instructions.

Deliverables for this milestone include:

A live demo presentation

Docker images of both the front end and back end

A PDF report

 

M4 Additions to the Existing System
For this milestone, your project must include the following new components and improvements:

1. Integration with an External System
Integrate at least one external API into your project.

The API must be discussed and approved by your TA before submission. Failure to obtain approval will result in an automatic failure for this part.

 

2. Front-End Implementation
While the aesthetics of the interface will not be graded, your front end should:

Provide clear pathways for users to search, find, and interact with resources or items.

Include a dedicated admin interface that enables administrators to:

Manage data efficiently.

Monitor user or system activity.

Perform administrative actions (e.g., edits, deletions, applying penalties).

 

3. Individual Functionality Requirement
Each student must implement a completely new functionality within the system.

This functionality must be approved by the TA before submission. Code related to a student’s individual functionality must be written entirely by that student. Failure to obtain approval will result in a failing grade for this component.

 

Deliverables
1. Demo Presentation
You will present your demo during the last week of class. This presentation should demonstrate your system’s complete functionality and how it meets all project requirements.

Presentation Guidelines:

Duration: Maximum of 6 minutes (strict limit — exceeding time will result in penalties).

Participation: Every team member must:

Present the features they personally implemented.

Speak during the presentation.

Format: There is no formal structure, teams are encouraged to be creative in their presentation style.

Attendance: All students must attend the final class session and be ready to present when called.

 

2. Project Deliverables
Submit a fully functional system with complete supporting documentation. Your submission must include:

a. Docker Images

One Docker image for the front end

One Docker image for the back end

Both images must run successfully in Docker containers

Docker Compose File and your requirements.txt for your project
b. Requirements Fulfilment

Ensure that 100% of the project’s requirements have been implemented.

Include a traceability matrix indicating:

Fully completed requirements

Partially completed requirements

Not completed requirements

 

c. Step-by-Step Deployment and Handover Guide
Provide a comprehensive guide that allows anyone to deploy and maintain your system. This should include:

Installation Instructions: Step-by-step setup procedures for running the system using Docker.

Dependencies: A complete list of required tools, libraries, and services (with version details).

Maintenance Requirements: Details on ongoing maintenance, including:

Account credentials (if applicable)

Database management procedures

Configuration of external APIs or service

d. Project Contribution of each team member (% for the entire project) and one for Milestone 4
